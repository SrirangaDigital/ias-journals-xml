				<title>Important Crustal Growth in the Phanerozoic: Isotopic Evidence of Granitoids from East-Central Asia</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0005-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The growth of the continental crust is generally believed to have been essentially completed in the Precambrian, and the amount of juvenile crust produced in the Phanerozoic is considered insignificant. Such idea of negligible growth in the Phanerozoic is now challenged by the revelation of very large volume of juvenile crust produced in the period of 500 to 100 Ma in several orogenic belts. While appreciable volumes of juvenile terranes in North America (Canadian Cordillera, Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Range, Appalachians) have been documented based on Nd isotopic data, the mass of new crust formed in the East-Central Asian Orogenic Belt (ECAOB), eastern part of the Altaid Tectonic Collage, appears to be much greater than the above terranes combined. New and published Nd-Sr isotope data indicate that the Phanerozoic granitoids from the southern belt of the ECAOB (Xinjiang-West Mongolia-Inner Mongolia-NE China) as well as from Mongolia and Transbaikalia were generated from sources dominated by a depleted mantle component. These granitoids represent a significant growth of juvenile crust in the Phanerozoic.</p>
					<p>Although most plutons in this huge orogenic belt belong to the calc-alkaline series, the ECAOB is also characterized by the emplacement of voluminous A-type granites. The origin of these rocks is probably multiple and is still widely debated. However, the isotopic data (Sr-Nd-O) and trace element abundance patterns of A-type granites from the ECAOB clearly indicate their mantle origin.</p>
					<p>The evolution of the ECAOB and the entire Altaid Collage is most likely related to successive accretion of arc complexes. However, the emplacement of a large volume of post-tectonic A-type granites requires another mechanism, probably through a series of processes including underplating of massive basaltic magma, partial melting of these basic rocks to produce granitic liquids, followed by extensive fractional crystallization. The proportion of juvenile to recycled, as well as that of arc-related to plume-generated, continental crust remains to be evaluated by more systematic dating and isotope tracer studies.</p>

				<title>Anasagar gneiss: A folded granitoid pluton in the Phanerozoic South Delhi Fold Belt, central Rajasthan</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0022-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Anasagar gneiss was emplaced as a concordant sheet like body along the contact of quartzite and pelitic/semipelitic schist horizons in the northern part of the South Delhi Fold Belt. It is typically a granite gneiss containing megacrysts of K-feldspar set in a recrystallised foliated matrix. The megacrysts are in general converted to granular aggregates, often retaining their crystal outline. Garnet, sillimanite (fibrolite) and rarely staurolite are the metamorphic minerals in the gneiss; these are also present in the enveloping supracrustal rocks. Both the gneiss and the supracrustal rocks are involved in polyphase deformation. F1 isoclinal folds are present only on minor scale in the supracrustal rocks. F2 major and minor folding have affected both the gneiss and the supracrustal rocks. These are asymmetrical folds with alternate flat and steep, locally overturned, limbs and have consistent easterly vergence. F3 folds are upright and coaxial with F2. F4 puckers and large scale warps have E-W to ESE-WNW subvertical axial planes. The gneiss is exposed in the core of an F3 arch on the flat limb of a major F2 antiform whose axial trace is bent by an F4 fold. The intrusion was pre-F2 and late-tectonic with F1. U-Pb zircon dating suggests a crystallization age of 1849 Â± 8 Ma. Hence the Anasagar gneiss is older than the late- to post-tectonic ``Erinpura-type'' granite in the South Delhi Fold Belt.</p>

				<title>Emplacement of Amba Dongar Carbonatite-alkaline Complex at Cretaceous/Tertiary Boundary: Evidence from 40Ar-39Ar Chronology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0039-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>$^{40}{\rm Ar}-^{39}{\rm Ar}$ analyses of three fresh alkaline rock samples and a phlogopite separate from a carbonatite from Amba Dongar carbonatite-alkaline complex of the Deccan Flood Basalt Province, India, yield indistinguishable precise plateau ages of $64.8\pm 0.6, 64.7\pm 0.5, 65.5\pm  0.8$ and $65.3\pm 0.6 {\rm Ma}$, giving a mean plateau age of $65.0\pm  0.3{\rm Ma}$, which is the age of emplacement of this complex. This age implies contemporaneity of Amba Dongar with several other carbonatite-alkaline activities of Chhota Udaipur subprovince and is consistent with their Reunion-Deccan plume origin hypothesis. The emplacement of these complexes at 65 Ma makes them very significant in the ongoing debate on the K/T extinctions owing to their capacity to rapidly inject a substantial amount of ${\rm CO}_2$ and ${\rm SO}_2$ into the atmosphere.</p>

				<title>Sr Isotopic Evidence on the Spilitic Degradation of the Deccan Basalt</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0049-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Similar Sr isotopic ratios ($\sim$0.7055) for the tholeiite-spilite flow unit and the associated mineral phases, of Bombay (Deccan Traps) provide a direct evidence for the spilitic degradation of tholeiite. In contrast, a dramatic increase in the rare earth elements (REE) from basalt to spilite is rather puzzling as rare earths are considered to be relatively immobile. The geochemistry thus suggests that the process of spilitization is due to the reaction with a complex fluid having identical Sr-isotopic composition as that of the basaltic magma - thereby masking the details of the mixing process.</p>

				<title>Sm-Nd Ages of Two Meta-Anorthosite Complexes Around Holenarsipur: Constraints on the Antiquity of Archean Supracrustal Rocks of the Dharwar Craton</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0057-0065</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Whole-rock Sm-Nd isochron ages are reported for two stratiform meta-anorthosite complexes emplaced into the Archean supracrustal-gneiss association in the amphibolite facies terrain around Holenarsipur, in the Dharwar carton, South India.  While these metaperidotite-pyroxenite-gabbro-anorthosite complexes are petrologically and geochemically similar, they differ in the intensity of tectonic fabric developed during the late Archean (c.2.5Ga) deformation.  They also differ in their whole-rock Sm-Nd isochron ages and initial Nd isotopic compositions: $3.285\pm 0.17$ {\rm Ga}, $\varepsilon {\rm Nd} =0.82\pm 0.78$ for the Honnavalli meta-anorthosite complex from a supracrustal enclave in the low-strain zone, and $2.495\pm 0.033 {\rm Ga},\varepsilon {\rm Nd} =-2.2+-0.3$ for the Dodkadnur meta-anorthosites from the high-strain southern arm of the Holenarsipur Supracrustal Belt (HSB).  We interpret these results as indicating that the magmatic protoliths of both meta-anorthosite complexes were derived from a marginally depleted mantle at c.3.29 Ga but only the Dodkadnur rocks were isotopically reequilibrated on a cm-scake about 800 Ma later presumably due to the development of strong penetrative fabrics in them during Late Archean thermotectonic event around 2.5Ga.  Our results set a younger age limit at c.3.29Ga for the supracrustal rocks of the HSB in the Dharwar craton.</p>

				<title>Compilation of Radiogenic Isotope Data in Mexico and their Petrogenetic Implications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0067-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seven hundred and twenty-five Sr, two hundred and forty-three Nd and one hundred and fifty-one Pb isotopic ratios from seven different Mexican magmatic provinces were compiled in an extensive geochemical database. Data were arranged according to the Mexican geological provinces, indicating for each province total number of analyses, range and mean of values and two times standard deviation ($2\sigma$). Data from seven provinces were included in the database: Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB), Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), Baja California (BC), Pacific Ocean (PacOc), Altiplano (AP), Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS), and Sierra Madre Oriental (SMOr). Isotopic values from upper mantle and lower crustal xenoliths, basement outcrops and sediments from the Cocos Plate were also compiled. In the MVB the isotopic ratios range as follows: $^{87}{\rm Sr}/^{86}{\rm Sr} 0.703003-0.70841; ^{143} {\rm Nd}/^{144}{\rm Nd} 0.512496-0.513098; ^{206}{\rm Pb}/^{204}{\rm Pb} 18.567-19.580; ^{207}{\rm Pb}/^{204}{\rm Pb} 15.466-15.647; ^{208}{\rm Pb}/^{204}{\rm Pb} 38.065-38.632$. The SMO shows a large variation in $^{87}{\rm Sr}/^{86}{\rm Sr}$ ranging from ~ 0.7033 to 0.71387. $^{143}{\rm Nd}/^{144} {\rm Nd}$ ratios are relatively less variable with values from 0.51191 to 0.51286. Pb isotope ratios in the SMO are as follows: $^{206}{\rm Pb}/^{204}{\rm Pb} 18.060-18.860; ^{207}{\rm Pb}/^{204}{\rm Pb} 15.558- 15.636; ^{208}{\rm Pb}/^{204}{\rm Pb} 37.945-38.625$. PacOc rocks show the most depleted Sr and Nd isotopic ratios (0.70232-0.70567 for Sr and 0.512631-0.513261 for Nd). Pb isotopes for PacOc show the following range: $^{206}{\rm Pb}/^{204}{\rm Pb} 18.049-19.910; ^{207}{\rm Pb}/^{204}{\rm Pb} 15.425-15.734; ^{208}{\rm Pb}/^{204}{\rm Pb} 37.449-39.404$. The isotopic ratios of the AP rocks seem to be within the range of those from the PacOc.</p>
					<P>Most samples with reported Sr and Nd isotopic data are spread within and around the ``mantle array''. The SMO seems to have been formed by a mixing process between mantle derived magmas and continental crust. The MVB appears to have a larger mantle component, with AFC as the dominant petrogenetic process for the evolved rocks. There is still a need for Pb isotopic data in all Mexican magmatic provinces andofNdisotopes in BC,AP, SMS, and SMOr.</P>

				<title>Error Propagation in Equations for Geochemical Modeling of Radiogenic Isotopes in Two-Component Mixing</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0079-0088</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents error propagation equations for modeling of radiogenic isotopes during mixing of two components or end-members. These equations can be used to estimate errors on an isotopic ratio in the mixture of two components, as a function of the analytical errors or the total errors of geological field sampling and analytical errors. Two typical cases (``Small errors'' and ``Large errors'') are illustrated for mixing of Sr isotopes. Similar examples can be formulated for the other radiogenic isotopic ratios. Actual isotopic data for sediment and basalt samples from the Cocos plate are also included to further illustrate the use of these equations. The isotopic compositions of the predicted mixtures can be used to constrain the origin of magmas in the central part of the Mexican Volcanic Belt. These examples show the need of high quality experimental data for them to be useful in geochemical modeling of magmatic processes.</p>

				<title>Isotopic Composition of Xenon in Petroleum from the Shell Bullwinkle Field</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have measured the abundance and isotopic composition of xenon in petroleum samples from the Shell Bullwinkle Field off the coast of Louisiana. We used an oxidation and purification procedure designed to insure complete extraction and clean up of xenon from the petroleum.</p>
					<P>The xenon isotopic composition was found to be similar to the atmospheric value for one petroleum sample. While the results of the second sample suggest possible enrichment of the heavier isotopes, the errors associated with these excesses preclude a definitive statement to that effect. No monoisotopic enrichment in $^{129}{\rm Xe}$ was detected in either sample, the presence of which might have allowed us to deduce the petroleum age. Our results represent only the second xenon measurement from petroleum, and the concentrations are within the range of values published in the earlier report.</P>

				<title>Factors Controlling the Groundwater Transport of U, Th, Ra, and Rn</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0095-0108</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A model for the groundwater transport of naturally occurring U, Th, Ra, and Rn nuclides in the $^{238}{\rm U}$ and $^{232}{\rm Th}$ decay series is discussed. The model developed here takes into account transport by advection and the physico-chemical processes of weathering, decay,  $\alpha$-recoil, and sorption at the water-rock interface. It describes the evolution along a flowline of the activities of the $^{238}{\rm U}$ and $^{232}{\rm Th}$ decay series nuclides in groundwater. Simple sets of relationships governing the activities of the various species in solution are derived, and these can be used both to calculate effective retardation factors and to interpret groundwater data. For the activities of each nuclide, a general solution to the transport equation has been obtained, which shows that the activities reach a constant value after a distance $\bar{x}_i$, characteristic of each nuclide. Where   $\bar{x}_i$ is much longer than the aquifer length, (for $^{238}{\rm U}, ^{234}{\rm U}$, and $^{232}{\rm Th}$), the activities grow linearly with distance. Where  $\bar{x}_i$  is short compared to the aquifer length, (for $^{234}{\rm Th}, ^{230}{\rm Th}, ^{228}{\rm Th}, ^{228}{\rm Ra}$, and $^{224}{\rm Ra}$), the activities rapidly reach a constant or quasi-constant activity value. For $^{226}{\rm Ra}$ and $^{222}{\rm Rn}$, the limiting activity is reached after 1 km.</p>
					<p>High $\delta^{234}{\rm U}$ values (proportional to the ratio $\varepsilon^{234}{\rm Th}/^{W238}{\rm U}$) can be obtained through high recoil fraction and/or low weathering rates. The activity ratios $^{230}{\rm Th}/^{232}{\rm Th}, ^{228}{\rm Ra}/^{226}{\rm Ra}$ and $^{224}{\rm Ra}/^{226}{\rm Ra}$ have been considered in the cases where either weathering or recoil is the predominant process of input from the mineral grain. Typical values for weathering rates and recoil fractions for a sandy aquifer indicate that recoil is the dominant process for Th isotopic ratios in the water. Measured data for Ra isotope activity ratios indicate that recoil is the process generally controlling the Ra isotopic composition in water. Higher isotopic ratios can be explained by different desorption kinetics of Ra. However, the model does not provide an explanation for $^{228}{\rm Ra}/^{226}{\rm Ra}$ and $^{224}{\rm Ra}/^{226}{\rm Ra}$ activity ratios less than unity.</p>
					<p>From the model, the highest $^{222}{\rm Rn}$ emanation equals $2\varepsilon$. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that $^{222}{\rm Rn}$ activity can be used as a first approximation for input by recoil (Krishnaswami et al 1982). However, high $^{222}{\rm Rn}$ emanation cannot be explained by production from the surface layer as formulated in the model. Other possibilities involve models including surface precipitation, where the surface layer is not in steady-state.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Stable hydrogen ($\delta{\rm D}$) and oxygen ($\delta^{18}{\rm O}$) isotope ratios of the headwaters of the Indus and its tributaries, surface ice in glaciers, saline and fresh water lakes and thermal springs in the Himalayan and Trans- Himalayan (Kashmir) region are reported.

The unique signature of a higher deuterium excess (d) of the `Western Disturbance' is preserved in these samples. An altitude effect of -0.9 per mil/km is observed in the $\delta^{18}{\rm O} of Indus waters. At a lower altitude (Beas) the altitude effect is almost double, indicating that the altitude effect decreases with elevation in this region.</p>

				<title>Climatic significance of D/H and $^{13}{\rm C}/^{12}{\rm C}$ ratios in Irish oak cellulose</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0117-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>$\delta{\rm D}$ and $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ analyses of cellulose nitrate from two modern Irish oak trees that form part of the 7400 year long chronology were carried out, covering a period of 123 years (1861-1983 A.D.) with a 5 year resolution so as to assess the potential of this long chronology for retrieval of palaeoenvironmental data. One of the trees (Q5293) showed significant correlations of $\delta{\rm D}, \delta^{13}{\rm C}$ and ring width with mean annual temperatures as recorded at the Armagh weather station nearby and the mean fall temperatures of Central England. The other tree (Q5296) did not exhibit any significant climatic correlations either because it grew utilizing a nearby permanent source of ground water or because the intra-ring isotopic variations in Irish oak are significant enough to mask the climatic signal. Whilst our results have given a positive indication of the usefulness of these trees for palaeoenvironmental information, more trees need to be analysed to confirm our findings.</p>
					<P>Even though one of the trees did not exhibit climatic correlations, both trees show a significant positive correlation of $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ and a negative correlation of $\delta{\rm D}$ with ring width variations. Furthermore, two tree samples that grew during the 1620s B.C., when a volcano is thought to have erupted on the Aegean island of Santorini, show increased $\delta{\rm D}$ and decreased $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ for one to two decades following the eruption, though the magnitudes of change seem to vary with site and trees. We have proposed a possible mechanism based on tree phenology to explain both the above effects.</P>

				<title>Late Glacial and Holocene  Paleoliminology of two temperate lakes inferred from sediment organic $\delta^13{\rm C}$ chronology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0129-0140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The stable carbon isotope ($\delta^{13}{\rm C}$) and elemental C/N ratios in Total Organic Carbon (TOC) extracted from radiometrically dated cores from two Midwestern USA lakes were determined to investigate the factors that control these values in temperate lakes. The range of $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ values ( -26 to -32%) and C/N ratios (mean value $\sim$ 10.8) are typical of values reported for other temperate lake organic matter in this region. In the core from Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, a negative correlation was seen between the TOC and $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$, which can be interpreted in terms of a re-mixing and consumption of sedimented organic carbon along with rapid equilibration throughout the water column. No correlation was seen between the TOC and $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ in the record from Ladd Lake, Ohio, implying that in this latter lake productivity alone was not a singular process controlling the isotope ratio. Here, it is suggested that equilibrium conditions are maintained such that the DIC of the water is never depleted of aqueous ${\rm CO}_2$ during high organic production and the resulting $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ of the organic carbon lacks correlation with the TOC. Further, in this lake a fine resolution analysis was carried out which indicated a possible anthropogenic influence on the isotope ratio around times when human settlement ($\sim$ 300 yrs ago) and enhanced agricultural practices ( $\sim$ 80 yrs ago) were significant. The study shows that carbon isotope studies are useful in paleolimnologic investigations.</p>

				<title>Is there a stable isotope evidence for the CO2 fertiliser effect</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0141-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has been suggested that part of the so-called ''missing sink'' of carbon dioxide introduced into the atmosphere by anthropogenic activities, that is the imbalance between estimated anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and oceanic uptake, may be stored in the vegetation in midlatitudes. Precise mecha- nisms of abstraction of additional carbon dioxide by vegetation, also known as the ``fertilization effect'', are poorly understood. Stable carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of cellulose extracted from annual growth rings (covering the time period 1980-1993) in an oak tree from Kalamazoo, SW Michigan provide a basis to investigate at a physiological level how the fertilization effect may operate. The carbon isotope ratios show that the intercellular concentration of carbon dioxide increased due to an increase in stomatal opening. Although increased intercellular concentration of carbon dioxide translated to increased Water Use Efficiency and assimilation rates, it also resulted in increased transpiration rate as shown by higher D/H of the fixed carbon. The two-fold significance of the isotope data are: first, they provide the first field evidence based on isotope studies for excess ${\rm CO}_2$ induced biomass production and second, they suggest that this mechanism is likely to operate only in limited environments. Vegetation in regions where mois- ture availability is not restricted so that there can be a gain in water use efficiency despite increased leaf evaporation are best suited to sequester excess carbon from the atmosphere.</p>

				<title>Effect of intraband variability on stable isotope and density time series obtained from banded corals</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0145-0151</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density, $\delta^{18}{\rm O}$ and $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ were measured along two tracks, one close to the central growth axis and the other, $\sim 20^\circ$ off the axis, in a coral (Porites lutea) collected from the Stanley Reef, Central Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The $\delta^{18}{\rm O}$ variations in the coral are well correlated with sea surface temperature changes. The common variances between the two tracks were about 60% in the $\delta^{18}{\rm O}, \delta^{13}{\rm C}$ and the skeletal density variations. Part of the noise (40%) could be due to the difficulty of sampling exactly time contemporaneous parts of each band along the two tracks and part of it could be due to genuine intraband variability. In spite of the intraband variability, the time series obtained from the two tracks are similar, indicating that the dominant causative factor for the isotopic variations is external, i.e., the environmental conditions that prevail during the growth of the coral; density band formation does not appear to be directly controlled by the sea surface temperature.</p>

				<title>Glacial-interglacial changes in the surface water characteristics of the  Andaman Sea: Evidence from stable ratios of planktonic foraminifera</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0153-0156</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses of the planktonic foraminifera (Globigerinoides ruber) from a deep sea sediment core (GC-1) in the Andaman Sea show high glacial-to-Holocene $\delta^{18}{\rm 0}$ amplitude of 2.1% which is consistent with previously published records from this marginal basin and suggest increased salinity and/or decreased temperature in the glacial surface waters of this region.</p>
					<P>A pulse of $^{18}{\rm O}$ enrichment during the last deglaciation can be attributed to a Younger Dryas cooling event and/or to a sudden decrease of fresh water influx from the Irrawady and Salween rivers into the Andaman Sea. High $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ values observed during the isotopic stages 2 and 4 are probably due to the enhanced productivity during glacial times in the Andaman Sea.</P>

					<p>$\delta^{18}{\rm O}$ and $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ of G. sacculifer have been measured in five cores from the northern Indian Ocean. In addition, high resolution analysis (1 to 2 cm) was performed on one core (SK-20-185) for both $\delta^{18}{\rm O}$ and $\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ in five species of planktonic foraminifera. ${\rm CaCO}_3$ variation was measured in two cores. The results, presented here, show that</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the summer monsoon was weaker during 18 ka and was stronger during 9 ka, relative to modern conditions;</li>
						<li>$\delta^{13}{\rm C}$ variations are consistent with independent evidence that shows that during the last glacial maximum (LGM; 18 ka) the upwelling was reduced while during 9 ka it was vigorous;</li>
						<li>calculation of ${\rm CaCO}_3$ flux shows that the LGM was characterized by low biogenic productivity in the Arabian Sea while during the Holocene productivity increased by $\sim$65%, as a direct consequence of the changes in upwelling. Similar changes (of lesser magnitude) are also seen in the equatorial Indian Ocean. The amount of terrigenous input into the Arabian Sea doubled during LGM possibly due to the higher erosion rate along the west coast;</li>
						<li>$\delta^{18}{\rm O}$ values indicate that the Arabian Sea was saltier by 1 to 2% during LGM. The northern part was dominated by evaporation while in the equatorial part there was an increased precipitation.</li>

					<p>Ferromanganese crusts from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans record the Nd and Pb isotope compositions of the water masses from which they form as hydrogenous precipitates.

Superimposed on the distinct basin-specific signatures are variations in Nd and Pb isotope time series which have been particularly marked over the last 5 Ma.</P>
					<P>It is shown that changes in erosional inputs, particularly associated with Himalayan uplift and the northern hemisphere glaciation have influenced Indian and Atlantic Ocean deep water isotopic composi- tions respectively.

				<page>0181-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The radionuclide $^{10}{\rm Be}$ (half-life 9 1:5 my), produced naturally in the Earth's atmosphere by nuclear interactions of cosmic rays, was sought in ocean sediments in the late fifties, considering its potential usefulness as a radiotracer for dating sediments. $^{10}{\rm Be}$ was discovered independently by two groups, one in India and the other in the USA, and used only for dating marine sediments and manganese nodules until the seventies. Subsequently, as a result of a technical advance resulting in the improvement in the sensitivity of measurement of $^{10}{\rm Be}$ by about a factor of $10^6$, there was a global rush to measure this nuclide in most materials participating in the physical, chemical and biological processes in the dynamic geosphere. This paper outlines the reasons for this ``isotope rush'', and the lessons learned from these studies. I also present my personal views of the special attractive features of this nuclide on the one hand, and on the other, the pitfalls or the wrong message this nuclide could convey!</p>

				<title>Sr isotopes in the Orgueil CI meteorite:  Chronology of early solar system hydrothermal  activity</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0187-0193</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New Sr isotopic analyses and calculated formation ages of carbonates from the Orgueil CI meteorite are reported. Among the samples analyzed in this work, dolomites give the youngest formation ages and may have been deposited intermittently starting near the time of parent body formation and continuing for at least 30 Ma. The Sr isotope data also suggest that breunnerites (Fe-Mn-Mg carbonates) crystallized after dolomite formation. Leaching experiments on bulk meteorite samples provide evidence for a very mobile, water soluble Sr reservoir in Orgueil that is characterized by extremely radiogenic Sr ($^{87}{\rm Sr}/^{86}{\rm Sr} \approx 0.81- 0.82$). This unsupported Sr reflects recent element redistribution, possibly at the time of parent body breakup recorded by the $\sim 10$ Ma exposure age of Orgueil. The carbonate data in particular corroborate earlier indications that hydrothermal processes were among the earliest events to affect the CI parent body.</p>

				<page>0195-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The notion of remote element synthesis has recently been modified to explain the presence of nucleogenetic isotopic anomalies and decay products of short-lived nuclides by injection of a small amount of exotic nucleogenetic material. Even with this modification, remote element synthesis seems inconsistent with the following observations:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Evidence of coupled variations in the chemical and isotopic compositions of the source material for meteorites.</li>
						<li>Residual coupling of chemical and isotopic heterogeneities across planetary distances in the solar system today.</li>
						<li>The mass-fractionation relationship seen across isotopes of elements in the planetary system, in the solar wind, and in solar flares.</li>
						<li>Linkage of short-lived radioactivities with isotopic anomalies and with physical properties of their host grains, as expected for early condensate of fresh stellar debris.</li>
						<li>Temporal and spatial distributions of short-lived nuclides and their decay products.</li>
						<li>Mirror-image ( $+$ and $-$ ) isotopic anomalies in meteorite grains that sum to ``normal'' isotopic ratios, as expected of unmixed products of the same nuclear reactions that produced our bulk elements.</li>
						<li>The lack of supporting evidence for ``presolar'' grains or nearby stars that injected exotic material into the early solar nebula.</li>

					<p>The Indian Climate Research Programme (ICRP) focuses on the study of climate variability and its impact on agriculture. To address the role of the Bay of Bengal in monsoon variability, a process study was organised during July-August 1999, deploying research ships, buoys, INSAT, coastal radar and conventional observational systems to collect information about the coupled ocean-atmosphere system over the warm waters of the Bay of Bengal. The paper gives the background of the ICRP and the organisation and implementation of the Bay of Bengal Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX) in its field phase.</p>

					<p>BOBMEX-Pilot was organised from 23rd October - 11th November, 1998 when the seasonal trough had already shifted to south Bay of Bengal. The activity during this period was marked by the development of a monsoon depression from 26th-29th October that weakened over the sea; onset of northeast monsoon along the east coast of India on 29th October; a low pressure area that formed on 2nd November over southwest Bay off Sri Lanka -southTamilnadu coast; and another cyclonic circulation that formed towards the end of the BOBMEX-Pilot period.

				<abstract>
					<p>Although India has a long experience in ship-borne experiments and oceanographic instrumentation, the atmospheric component has not received much attention in the past. In this paper, the basis of the atmospheric instrumentation system assembled for use on board ORV Sagar Kanya for the BOBMEX- Pilot experiment is described along with some representative results. Wherever possible, Woods Hole's IMET recommendations for meteorological sensors for applications in the marine environment have been followed to keep our measurements in par with international standards. The sensors were tested during the BOBMEX-Pilot experiment and all sensors worked well. Velocity, humidity and temperature data have been successfully collected using fast sensors. It is shown that the component due to the ship's pitching motion can be removed from the measured vertical velocity by making use of an accelerometer. This makes it possible to calculate the surface fluxes by direct methods.</p>

					<p>The atmospheric boundary layer characteristics observed during the BOBMEX-Pilot experiment are reported. Surface meteorological data were acquired continuously through an automatic weather monitoring system and manually every three hours. High resolution radiosondes were launched to obtain the vertical thermal structure of the atmosphere. The study area was convectively active, the SSTs were high, surface air was warm and moist, and the surface air moist static energy was among the highest observed over the tropical oceans. The mean sea air temperature difference was about $1.25^\circ C$ and the sea skin temperature was cooler than bucket SST by $0.5^\circ C$. The atmospheric mixed layer was shallow, fluctuated in response to synoptic conditions from 100 m to 900 m with a mean around 500 m.</p>

				<page>0239-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes measurement of air-sea parameters and estimation of sensible and latent heat fluxes by the ``Inertial-Dissipation'' technique over south Bay of Bengal. The data were collected on ORV Sagar Kanya during BOBMEX-Pilot cruise during the period 23rd October 1998 to 12th November 1998 over south Bay of Bengal. The fluxes are estimated using the data collected through fast response sensors namely Gill anemometer, Sonic anemometer and IR Hygrometer. In this paper the analyses carried out for two days, one relatively cloud free day on November 3rd and the other cloudy with rain on November 1st, are presented. Sea surface and air temperatures are higher on November 3rd than on November 1st. Sensible heat flux for both the days does not show any significant variation over the period of estimation, whereas latent heat flux is more for November 3rd than November 1st. An attempt is made to explain the variation of latent heat flux with a parameter called thermal stability on the vapor transfer from the water surface, which depends on wind speed and air to sea surface temperature difference.</p>

				<title>Thermohaline structure and circulation in the upper layers of the southern Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-Pilot (October -- November 1998)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0255-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrographic data collected on board ORV Sagar Kanya in the southern Bay of Bengal during the BOBMEX-Pilot programme (October - November 1998) have been used to describe the thermohaline structure and circulation in the upper 200 m water column of the study region. The presence of seasonal Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the study area, typically characterized with enhanced cloudiness and flanked by the respective east/northeast winds on its northern part and west/southwest winds on its southern part, has led to net surface heat loss of about 55 W/$m^2$. The sea surface dynamic topography relative to 500 db shows that the upper layer circulation is characterised by a cyclonic gyre encompassing the study area. The eastward flowing Indian Monsoon Current (IMC) between $5^\circ $ N and $7^\circ $ N in the south and its northward branching along ${87}^\circ $ E up to ${13}^\circ $ N appear to feed the cyclonic gyre. The Vessel-Mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (VM-ADCP) measured currents confirm the presence of the cyclonic gyre in the southern Bay of Bengal during the withdrawing phase of the southwest monsoon from the northern/central parts of the Bay of Bengal.</p>

				<title>Diurnal variability of upper ocean temperature and heat budget in the southern Bay of Bengal during October -- November, 1998 (BOBMEX-Pilot)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0267-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-series data on upper-ocean temperature, Vessel-Mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (VM-ADCP) measured currents and surface meteorological parameters have been obtained for the first time in the southern Bay of Bengal at $7^\circ N, 10^\circ $ N, and $13^\circ $ N locations along $87^\circ $ E during October - November, 1998 under BOBMEX-Pilot programme. These data have been analysed to examine the diurnal variability of upper oceanic heat budget and to estimate the eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat in the upper layer. Diurnal variation of near-surface temperature is typical at northern location ($13^\circ $ N) with a range of $0.5^\circ $ C while the diurnal range of temperature is enhanced to $0.8^\circ $ C at the central location ($10^\circ $ N) due to intense solar radiation (1050 W/ ${\rm m}^2$), clear skies and low wind speeds. At the southern location ($7^\circ $ N), the diurnal variation of temperature is atypical with the minimum temperature occurring at 2000 hrs instead of at early morning hours. In general, the diurnal curve of temperature penetrated up to 15 to 20 m with decreasing diurnal range with depth. The VM-ADCP measured horizontal currents in the upper ocean were predominantly easterly/northeasterly at southern location, north/northerly at central location and northwesterly at northern location, thus describing a large-scale cyclonic gyre with the northward meridional flow along $87^\circ $ E. The magnitudes of heat loss at the surface due to air-sea heat exchanges and in the upper 50 m layer due to vertical diffusion of heat are highest at the southern location where intense convective activity followed by overcast skies and synoptic disturbance prevailed in the lower atmosphere. This and the estimated higher value ($0.0235 m^2/s$) of eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat in the upper ocean (0-50 m depth) suggest that 1-D processes controlled the upper layer heat budget at the southern location. On the other hand, during the fair weather conditions, at the central and northern locations, the upper layer gained heat energy, while the sea surface lost (gained) heat energy at northern (central) location. This and lower values of eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat (0.0045 and $0.0150m^2 /s$) and the northward intensification of horizontal currents at these locations suggest the greater role of horizontal heat advection over the 1-D processes in the upper ocean heat budget at these two locations.</p>

				<title>Controls of dimethyl sulphide in the Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-Pilot cruise 1998</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0279-0283</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The air-sea exchange is one of the main mechanisms maintaining the abundances of trace gases in the atmosphere. Some of these, such as carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulphide (DMS), will have a bearing on the atmospheric heat budget. While the former facilitates the trapping of radiation (greenhouse effect) the latter works in the opposite direction through reflectance of radiation back into space by sulphate aerosols that form from oxidation of DMS in atmosphere. Here we report on the first measurements made on DMS in the Bay of Bengal and the factors regulating its abundance in seawater. Phytoplankton alone does not seem to control the extent of DMS concentrations. We find that changes in salinity could effectively regulate the extent of DMSP production by marine phytoplankton. In addition, we provide the first ever evidence to the occurrence of DMS precursor, DMSP, in marine aerosols collected in the boundary layer. This suggests that the marine aerosol transport of DMSP will supplement DMS gaseous evasion in maintaining the atmospheric non-sea salt sulphur budget.</p>

					<p>An attempt has been made to study the marine boundary layer characteristics over Bay of Bengal using BOBMEX (Bay of Bengal and Monsoon Experiment) pilot experiment data sets, which was conducted between 23rd October and 12th November 1998 on board ORV Sagar Kanya. A one-dimensional multi- level atmospheric boundary layer with TKE-$\varepsilon $ closure scheme is employed to study the marine boundary layer characteristics. In this study two synoptic situations are chosen: one represents an active convection case and the other a suppressed convection. In the present article the marine boundary layer charac- teristics such as temporal evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, height of the boundary layer and the air- sea exchange processes such as sensible and latent heat fluxes, drag coefficient for momentum are simulated during both active and suppressed convection. Marine boundary layer height is estimated from the vertical profiles of potential temperature using the stability criterion. The model simulations are compared with the available observations.</p>

					<p>The present study is based on the observed features of the MBL (Marine Boundary Layer) during the Bay of Bengal and Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX) - Pilot phase. Conserved Variable Analysis (CVA) of the conserved variables such as potential temperature, virtual potential temperature, equivalent potential temperature, saturation equivalent potential temperature and specific humidity were carried out at every point of upper air observation obtained on board ORV Sagar Kanya. The values are estimated up to a maximum of 4 km to cover the boundary layer. The Marine Boundary Layer Height is estimated from the conserved thermodynamic profiles. During the disturbed period when the convective activity is observed, the deeper boundary layers show double mixing line structures. An attempt is also made to study the oceanic heat budget using empirical models. The estimated short-wave radiation flux compared well with the observations.</p>

				<title>Ocean circulation in the tropical Indo-Pacific during early Pliocene (5.6 - 4.2 Ma):  Paleobiogeographic and isotopic evidence</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0315-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A Comparison of late Neogene planktic foraminferal biogeography and stable isotopic records of shallow dwelling and deep dwelling planktic foraminifera from DSDP sites 214 (Ninetyeast Ridge, northeast Indian Ocean) and 586B (ontong-Java Plateau, western Equatorial Pacific) provides a clue to the nature of the ocean circulation in the tropical Indo-Pacific during early Pliocene.</p>
					<p>The Present study reveals that the late Neogene planktic foraminiferal data from the eastern and western sides of the Indonesian Seaway are very similar. The only distinct inter-ocean difference however is the absence of Pulleniatina spectablis from the Indian Ocean. This species makes its first evolutionary appearance in the Equatorial Pacific at about 5.6 Ma (Early Gilbert reversed) and ranges up to 4.2 Ma (Top Conhiti subchron). The complete absence of Pulleniatina spectablis from the Indian Ocean is attributed to blocking of westward flow of tropical waters of the Pacific to the Indian Ocean resulting in a major change in the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans during 5.6 to 4.2 ma.</p>
					<p>In order to understand the nature of this blockage, isotopic depth ranking of selected planktic foraminifera and thus may be interpreted that the shallow sills that mark the Seaway in modern times were present as early as 5.6 Ma.</p>
					<p>The distribution of Pulleniatina spectablis throughout the Equatorial Pacific reveals that Modern Equatorial Pacific Under Current (Cromwell Current) flowing towards east at a depth of 200-300 m (which is also the depth habitat of  Pulleniatina spectablis) was present at the beginning of the Pliocene (5.6 Ma).</p>
					<p>As a dequel to the blocking of the Indonesian Seaway and the resultant interruption in the flow of central Equatorial Current System of the Pacific to the west there was an increase in the western Pacific Warm Pool Waters and strengthening of the gyral circulation in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This eventually triggered the intensification of the Asian Monsoon System.</p>

				<title>Response of an ocean general circulation model to wind and thermodynamic forcings</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0329-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The stretched-coordinate ocean general circulation model has been designed to study the observed variability due to wind and thermodynamic forcings. The model domain extends from $60^\circ N$ to $60^\circ S$ and cyclically continuous in the longitudinal direction. The horizontal resolution is $5^\circ \times 5^\circ$ and 9 discrete vertical levels. First a spin-up experiment has been done with ECMWF-AMIP 1979 January mean fields. The wind stress, ambient atmospheric temperature, evaporation and precipitation have been used in order to derive mechanical and thermodynamical surface forcings. Next, the experiment has been extended for another 30 years (3 cycles each of 10 year period) with varying surface boundary conditions (from January 1979 to December 1988 of ECMWF-AMIP monthly fields for each cycle) along with 120 years extended spin-up control run's results as initial conditions. The results presented here are for the last 10 years simulations. The preliminary results of this experiment show that the model is capable of simulating some of the general features and the pattern of interannual variability of the ocean.</p>

				<title>Precipitation reconstruction using ring-width chronology of Himalayan cedar from western Himalaya: Preliminary results</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0339-0345</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara (D. Don) G. Don) due to its long age and wide ecological amplitude in the Himalayan region has strong dendroclimatic potential. A well replicated ring-width chronology of it, derived from the ensemble of tree-ring samples of two adjacent homogeneous sites, has been used to reconstruct precipitation for the non-monsoon months (previous year October to concurrent May) back to AD 1171. This provides the first record of hydrological conditions for the western Himalayan region, India during the whole of the `Little Ice Age' and latter part of the `Medieval Warm Period'. The reconstruction revealed the wettest and the driest non-monsoon months during the fourteenth and the thirteenth centuries, respectively. The seventeenth century consistently recorded dry non-monsoon months in the western Himalayan region. Surplus precipitation, especially more pronounced since the 1950s, is recorded in the current century.</p>

				<title>Diverse signatures of deformation, pressure-temperature and anatexis in the Rayagada sector of the Eastern Ghats granulite terrane</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0347-0369</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The granulites and granitoids around Rayagada in the north central part of the Eastern Ghats belt display structural and petrological differences when compared to similar rocks from Chilka and Jenapore in the northern Eastern Ghats. The impress of $F_1$ deformation is almost erased while that of $F_3$ is muted. The metapelites have a restricted chemical range and are non-migmatitic. There are two varieties of leptynitic granitoids, one of which is interlayered with yet another S-type granite containing cordierite. The maximum recorded temperature from geothermometers is $780^\circ C$, but the magnitude of pressure is comparatively low, the highest value being 6.3 kbar. Another distinctive feature of the pressure- temperature record is the absence of evidence of decompression in the lower realms of pressure and temperature. Metamorphic reactions that could be identified indicate cooling, a noteworthy reaction being the sillimanite to andalusite transformation. Integration of data from pressure-temperature sensors suggest cooling at two pressures, 6 and 5 kbar. The generation of two types of granitoids from metapelites is interpreted to be due to intersection with solidus curves for pelitic and graywacke-like compositions, constrained by recent experiments, at 6 and 5 kbar. The first melting occurred on a prograde path while the second one was due to increase in temperature during exhumation at tectonic rates.</p>
					<p>Thus inspite of a broad similarity in the geodynamic scenario across the northern part of the Eastern Ghat belt, differences in exhumation rates and in style of melting were responsible for producing different signatures in the Rayagada granulite terrane.</p>

					<p>A plain strain problem of an isotropic elastic liquid-saturated porous medium in poroelasticity has been studied. The eigenvalue approach using the Laplace and Fourier transforms has been employed and these transforms have been inverted by using a numerical technique. An application of infinite space with concentrated force at the origin has been presented to illustrate the utility of the approach. The displacement and stress components in the physical domain are obtained numerically. The results are shown graphically and can be used for a broad class of problems related to liquid-saturated porous media.</p>

				<page>0381-0391</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The degree sheet Aeromagnetic maps up to $17^\circ N$, acquired from the Geological Survey of India, have been manually redigitised at 6 minute intervals to study the long wavelength anomalies over peninsular India. These data have been collected at different survey altitude, epochs, flight line directions, etc. Great care has been taken to correct the total field map and remove the contribution due to the core field and prepare an accurate crustal anomaly map. For the first time, a regional map, depicting the NW-SE structural features north of the orthopyroxene isograd with the essentially E-W features to the south of it and revealing several well known structures, is presented. The analytical signal is calculated to delineate the source fields of these anomalies. It dramatically maps the charnockites and is able to delineate the orthopyroxene isograd. In the Dharwar region the magnetic signatures are associated with the intrusives/ iron ore bodies. Thus, we find that the source rocks of the aeromagnetic anomalies are the host province of charnockites in the SGT and the intrusives/iron ore bodies in the Dharwar belt. Gravity residuals are calculated and a tectonic map of the region is presented from the combined geopotential data.</p>

				<title>Analysis of pathfinder SST algorithm for global and regional conditions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0395-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As part of the Pathfinder program developed jointly by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a large database of in situ sea surface temperature (SST) measurements coincident with satellite data is now available to the user community. The Pathfinder Matchup Database (PMDB) is a multi-year, multi-satellite collection of coincident measurements from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and broadly distributed buoy data (matchups). This database allows the user community to test and validate new SST algorithms to improve the present accuracy of surface temperature measurements from satellites. In this paper we investigate the performance of a global Pathfinder algorithm to specific regional conditions. It is shown that for zenith angles less than $45^\circ $, the best-expected statistical discrepancy between satellite and buoy data is about $\sim 0.5 $ K. In general, the bias of the residuals (satellite - buoy) is negative in most regions, except in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas, where the residuals are always positive. A seasonal signal in SST residuals is observed in all regions and is strongest in the Indian Ocean. The channel-difference term used as a proxy for atmospheric water vapor correction is observed to be unresponsive for columnar water vapor values greater than 45 mm and high zenith angles. This unresponsiveness of the channels leads to underestimation of sea surface temperature from satellites in these conditions.</p>

				<title>Radiative Transfer Code: Application to the calculation of PAR</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0407-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The production of carbon in the ocean, the so-called primary production, depends on various physico- biological parameters: the biomass and nutrient amounts in oceans, the salinity and temperature of the water and the light available in the water column. We focus on the visible spectrum of the solar radiation defined as the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR). We developed a model (Chami et al. 1997) to simulate the behavior of the solar beam in the atmosphere and the ocean. We first describe the theoretical basis of the code and the method we used to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE): the successive orders of scattering (SO). The second part deals with a sensitivity study of the PAR just above and below the sea surface for various atmospheric conditions. In a cloudy sky, we computed a ratio between vector fluxes just above the sea surface and spherical fluxes just beneath the sea surface. When the optical thickness of the cloud increases this ratio remains constant and around 1.29. This parameter is convenient to convert vector flux at the sea surface as retrieved from satellite to PAR. Subsequently, we show how solar radiation as vector flux rather than PAR leads to an underestimate of the primary production up to 40% for extreme cases.</p>

				<title>Bio-optical properties of gelbstoff in the Arabian Sea at the onset of southwest monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0415-0425</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As part of the German JGOFS Indian Ocean Programme, a cruise occurred in the Arabian Sea in May 1997 at the onset of the southwest monsoon. Data on gelbstoff, chlorophyll $a$ and tryptophan-like fluorescence as well as gelbstoff absorption were obtained. They indicate, that these optical parameters support the interpretation of hydrographic and biogeochemical conditions. Tryptophan-like fluorescence seems to be a useful indicator of changes in the constitution of the biomass.</p>
					<p>A comparison of gelbstoff absorption and fluorescence data from the upper 100 m reveals only a weak covariance. Special emphasis is given to the fit procedure used for retrieving the exponential slope $S$ of the spectral absorption coefficient. $S$ values with a mean of 0.016 $nm^{-1}$ are found in the 350 to 480 nm wavelength range. A mean slope $S$ set to the frequently reported value of 0.014 $nm^{-1}$ in the exponential description of gelbstoff absorption might lead to a systematic over/underestimation, and thus to systematic errors, if single-wavelength absorption values are extrapolated to other spectral regions on the basis of this parameter.</p>

				<page>0427-0432</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Remotely sensed data on ocean colour of waters surrounding Sri Lanka received from the Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) are processed and analyzed. Raw data of 1 km resolution on relatively cloud free days during 1978--1986 are processed to produce sea surface chlorophyll maps within latitudes 4.5N--11N and longitudes 78E--85E, a region in the Indian Ocean surrounding Sri Lanka. The processed data include about 110 single day maps and composite averages for each month and season. The months of July, August and September are omitted in the calculation of averages due to insufficient data. The waters in the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay areas show high chlorophyll-a concentrations throughout the year. However, these high  values may represent other suspended particles and dissolved organic matter besides chlorophyll-a as this region is shallow (&lt; 100 m). Regions with high chlorophyll concentrations (&gt;0:5 mg $m^{-3}$) along the coast and western ocean region can be seen in the months of October and November, after the southwest monsoon period. As high surface chlorophyll concentrations may indicate high productivity, these regions need extensive measurements of primary production and also continuous monitoring of fish catches, during and after the southwest monsoon. Studies of particle composition in shallow water areas, in particular waters in Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar, should be carried out in order to elucidate the effect of non-phytogenic.</p>

				<title>Physical control of primary productivity on a seasonal scale in the central and eastern Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0433-0441</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using \textit{in situ} data collected during 1992--1997, under the Indian programme of Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), we show that the biological productivity of the Arabian Sea is tightly coupled to the physical forcing mediated through nutrient availability. The Arabian Sea becomes productive in summer not only along the coastal regions of Somalia, Arabia and southern parts of the west coast of India due to coastal upwelling but also in the open waters of the central region. The open waters in the north are fertilized by a combination of divergence driven by cyclonic wind stress curl to the north of the Findlater Jet and lateral advection of nutrient-rich upwelled waters from Arabia. Productivity in the southern part of the central Arabian Sea, on the other hand, is driven by advection from the Somalia upwelling. Surface cooling and convection resulting from reduced solar radiation and increased evaporation make the northern region productive in winter. During both spring and fall inter-monsoons, this sea remains warm and stratified with low production as surface waters are oligotrophic. Inter-annual variability in physical forcing during winter resulted in one-and-a-half times higher production in 1997 than in 1995.</p>

				<title>Abundance and relationship of bacteria with transparent exopolymer particles during the 1996 summer monsoon in the Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0443-0451</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bacterial abundance and production, numbers, sizes and concentrations of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were measured during the 1996 summer monsoon to understand the relationship between TEP, the most labile particulate organic carbon, and bacteria. While high regional variability in the vertical distribution of TOC was discernible, TEP concentrations  were high in surface waters at 18--$20^\circ N$ along $64^\circ E$ with concentrations well over 25 mg alginic acid equivalents $1^{-1}$ due to upwelling induced productivity. Their concentrations decreased with depth and were lower between 200 and 500 m. Bacterial concentrations were up to $1.99 \times 10^8 1^{-1}$ in the surface waters and decreased by an order of magnitude or more at depths below 500 m. A better relationship has been found between bacterial abundance and concentrations of TEP than between bacteria and TOC, indicating that bacterial metabolism is fueled by availability of TEP in the Arabian Sea. Assuming a carbon assimilation of 33%, bacterial carbon demand (BCD) is estimated to be 1.017 to 4.035 g C $m^{-2} d^{-1}$ in the surface waters. The observed TEP concentrations appear to be sufficient in meeting the surface and  subsurface BCD in the northern Arabian Sea.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This work presents models of the vertical distribution and flux of phytoplankton aggregates, including changes with time in the distribution of aggregate sizes and sinking speeds. The distribution of sizes is described by two parameters, the mass and number of aggregates, which greatly reduces the computational cost of the models. Simple experiments demonstrate the effects of aggregation on the timing and depth distribution of primary production and export. A more detailed ecological model is applied to sites in the Arabian Sea; it demonstrates that aggregation can be important for deep sedimentation even when its effect on surface concentrations is small, and it presents the difference in timing between settlement of aggregates and fecal pellets.</p>

				<title>Seasonal controls on surface $pCO_2$ in the central and eastern Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0471-0479</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The variability in partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($pCO_2$) and its control by biological and physical processes in the mixed layer (ML) of the central and eastern Arabian Sea during inter-monsoon, northeast monsoon, and southwest monsoon seasons were studied. The ML varied from 80--120 m during NE monsoon, 60--80 m and 20--30 m during SW- and inter-monsoon seasons, respectively, and the variability resulted from different physical processes. Significant seasonal variability was found in $pCO_2$ levels. During SW monsoon, coastal waters contain two contrasting regimes; (a) $pCO_2$ levels of 520--685 $\mu$atm were observed in the SW coast of India, the highest found so far from this region, driven by intense upwelling and (b) low levels of $pCO_2$ ($266 \mu$atm) were found associated with monsoonal fresh water influx. It varied in ranges of 416--527 $\mu$atm and 375--446 $\mu$atm during inter- and NE monsoon, respectively, in coastal waters with higher values occurring in the north. The central Arabian Sea $pCO_2$ levels were 351--433, 379--475 and 385--432 $\mu$atm during NE- inter and SW monsoon seasons, respectively. The mixed layer $pCO_2$ relations with temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll $a$ and primary production revealed that the former is largely regulated by physical processes during SW- and NE monsoon whereas both physical and biological processes are important in inter-monsoon. Application of Louanchi \textit{et al} (1996) model revealed that the mixing effect is the dominant during monsoons, however, the biological effect is equally significant during SW monsoon whereas thermodynamics and fluxes influence during inter-monsoons.</p>

				<title>350 ka organic $\delta^{13}C$ record of the monsoon variability on the Oman continental margin, ArabianSea</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0481-0489</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The stable isotope compositions of sedimentary organic carbon and content of organic carbon for sediment cores recovered at two sites (sites 724C and 725C) during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg. 117 on the Oman continental margin are used to document variability of the monsoon winds for the past 350 ka. Although both sites have a mean $\delta^{13}C$ value of $-20.1%$, three zones depleted in $^{13}C$ are observable at site 724C during isotope stages 3, 8 and 10, while only one zone is recognizable at site 725C. Increased coastal upwelling during isotope stage 3 owing to intense SW monsoon winds resulted in higher concentration of $CO_2$ in the water column causing the formation of organic matter that was depleted in $^{13}C$. The other two zones deposited during oxygen isotope stages 8 and 10, which are also characterized by low values of organic carbon, nitrogen and C/N ratios, could be attributed to the dilution by terrestrial material derived from paleosol by transported by northwesterlies. Because of utilization of $^{13}C$ enriched dissolved $CO_2$ during the last glacial maximum Holocene sedimentary organic materials are depleted in $^{13}C$ relative to the the fomer. The content of residues organic carbon (ROC) is higher at site 724C (with an average of $2.3 \pm 1.2%$) relative to site 725C, which averages to $0.9 \pm 0.4%$ probably because of differences in the degree of preservation. Organic material deposited at site 725C has undergone more degradation relative to site 724C as reflected by a systematic downcore decrease in $^{13}C$ resulting from a loss of $^{13}C$ enriched organic compounds. Owing to lack of good chronology at site 725C, a zone that is characterized by low $\delta^{13}C$ values it could not be correlated with the other three zones observed at Site 724C.</p>

					<p>A 3-compartment model of phytoplankton growth dynamics has been coupled with a primitive-equation circulation model to better understand and quantify physical and biological processes in the Adriatic Sea. This paper presents the development and application of a data assimilation procedure based on optimal control theory. The aim of the procedure is to identify a set of model coefficient values that ensures the best fit between data and model results by minimizing a function that measures model and data discrepancies. In this sense, twin experiments have been successfully implemented in order to have a better estimation of biological model parameters and biological initial conditions.</p>

				<title>A coupled physical-biological-chemical model for the Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0503-0537</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A coupled physical-biological-chemical model has been developed at C-MMACS. for studying the time- variation of primary productivity and air-sea carbon-dioxide exchange in the Indian Ocean. The physical model is based on the Modular Ocean Model, Version 2 (MOM2) and the biological model describes the nonlinear dynamics of a 7-component marine ecosystem. The chemical model includes dynamical equation for the evolution of dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity. The interaction between the biological and chemical model is through the Redfield ratio. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide $pCO_2$ of the surface layer is obtained from the chemical equilibrium equations of Peng \textit{et al} 1987. Transfer coefficients for air-sea exchange of $CO_2$ are computed dynamically based on the wind speeds. The coupled model reproduces the high productivity observed in the Arabian Sea off the Somali and Omani coasts during the Southwest (SW) monsoon. The entire Arabian Sea is an outgassing region for $CO_2$   in spite of high productivity with transfer rates as high as 80 m-mol $C/m^2/day$ during SW monsoon near the Somali Coast on account of strong winds.</p>

				<title>Seismically constrained two-dimentional crustal thermal structure of the Cambay basin</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The temperature field within the crust is closely related to tectonic history as well as many othergeological processes inside the earth. Therefore, knowledge of the crustal thermal structure of a region is of great importance for its tectonophysical studies. This work deals with the two-dimensional thermal modelling to delineate the crustal thermal structure along a 230 km long Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) profile in the north Cambay basin. In this work P-wave velocities obtained from the DSS studies have been converted into heat generation values for the computation of temperature distribution. The model result reveals the Curie isotherm at a depth of $\approx 22$ km and Moho temperature at around $900^\Circ $C.</p>

				<title>Earthquake source model using strong motion displacement as response of finite elastic media</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0009-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The strong motion displacement records available during an earthquake can be treated as the response of the earth as the a structural system to unknown forces acting at unknown locations. Thus, if the part of the earth participating in ground motion is modelled as a known finite elastic medium, one can attempt to model the source location and forces generated during an earthquake as an inverse problem in structural dynamics. Based on this analogy, a simple model for the basic earthquake source is proposed. The unknown source is assumed to be a sequence of impulses acting at locations yet to be found. These unknown impulses and their locations are found using the normal mode expansion along with a minimization of mean square error. The medium is assumed to be finite, elastic, homogeneous, layered and horizontal with a specific set of boundary conditions. Detailed results are obtained for Uttarkashi earthquake. The impulse locations exhibit a linear structure closely associated with the causative fault. The results obtained are shown to be in good agreement with reported values. The proposed engineering model is then used to simulate the acceleration time histories at a few recording stations. The earthquake source in terms of a sequence of impulses acting at different locations is applied on a 2D finite elastic medium and acceleration time histories are found using finite element methods. The synthetic accelerations obtained are in close match with the recorded accelerations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Detailed gravity data collected across the Gadwal schist belt in the state of Andhra Pradesh show an  8.4 mgal residual gravity anomaly associated with meta-sediments/volcanics of the linear NNW--SSE trending schist belt that shows metamorphism from green schist to amphibolite facies. This schist belt is flanked on either side by the peninsular gneissic complex. The elevation and slab Bouguer corrected residual gravity profile data were interpreted using 2-D prism models. The results indicate a synformal structure having a width of 1.8 km at the surface, tapering at a depth of about 2.6 km with a positive density contrast of 0.15 gm/cc with respect to the surrounding peninsular gneissic complex.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry of sericite deposits at the base of the Paleoproterozoic Aravalli Supergroup, Rajasthan, India: Evidence for metamorphosed and metasomatised Precambrian Paleosol</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0039-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fine grained sericite deposits occur at the interface between Archean Mewar Gneiss Complex and the Proterozoic Aravalli Supergroup independent of shearing. They show a gradational contact with the basement granites and gneisses and a sharp contact with the overlying quartz pebble conglomeratic quartzites. Rip-up clasts of these sericite schists are found in the overlying conglomerates. The sericite schists are rich in sericite towards the top and contain chlorite towards the base. The sericite in these schists was formed by metasomatic alteration of kyanite and not from the feldspars of the basement granitoids and gneisses. Uni-directional variations of $SiO_2$ and $Al_2O_3$ , high $Al_2O_3$ content (&gt;30%), positive correlation between $Al_2O_3$ and $TiO_2$ , Ti/Al and Ti/Zr ratios, high pre-metasomatic chemical  indices of alteration (&gt;90), and enrichment of heavy rare earth elements relative to the parent granites and gneisses---all these chemical characteristics combined with field evidence suggest that the sericite schists are formed from a paleosol protolith, which developed on Archean basement between 2.5 and $\sim 2.1$ Ga in the Precambrian of Rajasthan. The superimposed metasomatic alteration restricts the use of $Fe^{2+} /Ti$ and $Fe^{3+} //Ti$ ratios of these paleosols for interpretation of $PO_2$ conditions in the atmosphere.</p>

				<title>Are Majhgawan-Hinota pipe rocks truly group-I kimberlite?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0063-0076</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The diamond bearing pipe rocks in MajhgawanâHinota (more than four pipes) occur as intrusives in sandstones of Kaimur Group. These Proterozoic ($974\pm 30â1170 \pm 20 Ma$) intrusive rocks, occupying the southeastern margin of Aravalli craton, were called as `micaceous kimberlite' in tune with the reported kimberlite occurrences from other parts of the world. Judging from the definition of kimberlite, as approved by the IUGS Subcommission on Systematics of Igneous Rocks, it is not justified to call these rocks as `micaceous kimberlite'. Rather the mineralogical assemblages such as absence of typomorphic mineral monticellite (primary), abundance of phlogopite cognate, frequent presence of barite and primary carbonate mostly as calcite coupled with ultrapotassic and volatile-rich (dominantly $H_2 O$) nature and high concentration of incompatible elements (such as Ba, Zr, Th, U), low Th/U ratios, low REE and no Eu-anomaly clearly indicate a close similarity with that of South African orangeites. Thus orangeites of Proterozoic age occur outside the Kaapvaal craton of South Africa which are much younger (200 Ma to 110 Ma) in age.</p>

				<title>Retrieval of vertical wind profiles during monsoon from satellite observed winds over the Indian Ocean using complex EOF analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0077-0086</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of this paper is to study the feasibility of deriving vertical wind profiles from current satellite observations. With this aim, we carried out complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis of a large number of radiosonde observations of wind profiles over the Indian Ocean during the monsoon months. It has been found that the first two CEOFs explain 67% of the total variance in wind fields. While the first principal component is well correlated with the winds at 850 mb ($r= 0.80$), the second one is highly correlated with winds at 200 mb ($r= 0.89$). This analysis formed the basis of a retrieval algorithm which ensures the retrieval of vertical profiles of winds using satellite tracked cloud motion vector winds. Under the assumption that accurate measurements of wind are available at the above mentioned levels, the r.m.s. error of retrieval of each component of wind is estimated to range between $2ms^{-1}$ and $6ms^{-1}$ at different levels, which is much less than the natural variance of winds at these levels. For a better visualization of retrieval, we have provided retrieved and true wind profiles side by side for four typical synoptic conditions during the monsoon season.</p>

				<title>Occurrence of heavy rainfall around the confluence line in monsoon disturbances and its importance in causing floods</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0087-0094</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well known that heavy rainfall occurs in the southwestern sector of the monsoon depressions due to strong convergence in that sector. By examining the rainfall distribution associated with the monsoon disturbances (lows and depressions) in one of the central Indian river basins, `Godavari', the author found that when the disturbance-centre is away from the basin, heavy rainfall may also occur in the basin area close to the confluence line and cause severe floods in the river. The confluence line is the zone of convergence between the northeasterlies to the west of the disturbance centre and the monsoon westerlies. This study further reveals the importance of the position and movement of the confluence line with respect to the basin, on which the intensity and the raising period of the resulting flood depend.</p>

				<title>Marine  biogeochemistries of Be and Al:  A study based on cosmogenic $^{10}Be$, Be and Al in marine calcite, aragonite, and opal</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0095-0102</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The geochemical behaviors of Be and Al in ocean waters have been successfully studied in recent years using natural, cosmogenic, radioactive $^{10}Be$ and $^{26}Al$ as tracers. The present day dissolved concentrations and distribution of the stable and radioactive isotopes of Be and Al in ocean waters have revealed their short residence times and appreciable effects of exchange uxes at the coastal and ocean-sediment interfaces. It follows that concentrations of these particle-active elements must have varied in the past with temporal changes in climate, biological productivity and aeolian ux of continental detritus to the oceans. We therefore investigated the feasibility of extending the measurements of Be and Al isotope concentrations in marine systems to the $10^3-10^6 y$ BP time scale. We report here the discovery of significant amounts of intrinsic Be and Al in marine foraminiferal calcite and coral aragonite, and of Al in opal (radiolarians) and aragonite (coral), which makes it possible to determine $^{10}Be/Be$ and $^{26}Al/Al$ in oceans in the past. We also report measured $^{10}Be/ ^9Be$ in foraminiferal calcite in Pacific Ocean cores, which reveal that the concentrations and ratios of the stable and cosmogenic isotopes of Be and Al have varied signicantly in the past 30 ky. The implications of these results are discussed.</p>

				<page>0103-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here an unusually high concentration of iridium in some alkali basalts and alkaline rocks of Deccan region having an age of about 65Ma, similar to the age of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. The alkali basalts of Anjar, in the western periphery of Deccan province, have irid-ium concentration as high as 178pg/g whereas the alkaline rocks and basalts associated with the Amba Dongar carbonatite complex have concentrations ranging between 8 and 80 pg/g. Some of these values are more than an order of magnitude higher than the concentration in the tholeiiticbasalts of Deccan, indicating the significance of alkaline magmatism in the iridium inventory at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Despite higher concentration, their contribution to the global inventory of iridium in the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary clays remains small. The concentration of iridium in uorites from Amba Dongar was found to be &lt; 30 pg/g indicating that iridium is not incorporated during their formation in hydrothermal activity.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry and magnetostratigraphy of Deccan flows at Anjar, Kutch</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0111-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chemical analysis of nine Deccan flow basalts at Anjar, Kutch, western India, indicates that all,except the uppermost flow F-9, are alkaline. In their major and trace element composition, the alkali basalts resemble Ocean island basalts (OIB). Similarities of many diagnostic trace element ratios (e.g. Sm/Nd, Ba/Nb,Y/Nb and Zr/Nb) are similar to those found in the R\acute{e}union Island basalts. The uppermost basalt is tholeiitic and chemically resembles the least contaminated Deccan basalt (Ambenali type). The Anjar basalts have iridium concentration ranging between 2 and 178 pg/g. Some of these values are higher by about an order of magnitude compared to the Ir concentration in other basalts of the Deccan. A synthesis of chemical, palaeomagnetic and geochronologic data enables us to construct a chemical and magnetic stratigraphy for these flows.</p>
					<p>The three flows below the iridium enriched intertrappean bed (IT III) show normal magnetic polarity whereas all except one of the upper basalts show reversed magnetic polarity. The sequence seems to have started in polarity zones 31N and probably continued up to 28R or 27R. The results presented here support the view that Deccan volcanism in Kutch occurred on a time span of a few million years.</p>

				<title>REE geochemistry of ore zones in the Archean auriferous schist belts of the eastern Dharwar craton, south India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0143-0159</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The eastern Dharwar Craton of southern India includes at least three $\sim 2700Ma$ supracrustal belts (schist belts) which have mesothermal, quartz-carbonate vein gold mineralization emplaced within the sheared metabasalts. In the Hutti and the Kolar schist belts, the host rocks are amphibolites and the ore veins have been anked by only a thin zone of biotitic alteration; in the Ramagiri belt, however, the host rocks to the veins have been a ected by more extensive but lower temperature alteration by uids. The rare earth element (REE) geochemistry of the host metabasalts, alteration zones, ore veins and the bulk sulfides separated from the ore veins and the alteration zones suggest that</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the REE chemistry of the immediate host rocks has been modified by uids which added LREE,</li>
						<li>the REE abundance of the ore veins vary with the amount of host rock fragments included in the veins,</li>
						<li>the sulfides formed during mineralization have significant REE concentration with patterns nearly identical to the ore veins and alteration zones and</li>
						<li>therefore the ore uids involved in gold mineralization here could be LREE enriched.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Because alteration and mineralization involved addition of REE, more LREE compared to HREE, the uids could be of higher temperature origin. The initial Nd isotope ratios in the host rocks ($\varepsilon Nd$ calculated at 2700 Ma) showed a large variation ($+$8 to $-$4) and a deep crustal source for the uid REE seems likely. A crustal source for Pb and Os in the ore samples of Kolar belt has previously been suggested (Krogstad \textit {et al} 1995; Walker \textit {et al} 1989). Such a source for ore uids is consistent with a late Archean (2500Ma) accretionary origin for the terrains of the eastern Dharwar Craton.</p>

				<title>Extreme heterogeneity in Sr isotope systematic in the Himalayan leucogranites: A possible mechanism of partial melting based on thermal modeling</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0161-0169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The small leucogranite plutons occurring in linear belts in the Higher Himalayas have formed due to post-collision partial melting within the Himalayan crust. Several studies have documented that the Sr isotopic ratios in the granite bodies show chaotic variation and meaningful Rb-Sr isochron ages are dicult, if not impossible, to obtain. In tectonically overthickened crust, the depth-temperature prole (geotherm) remains strongly transient for the rst tens of millions of years. It is proposed here that the intersecting relations between the transient geotherms and activity-dependent solidus/melting curves may generate small pods of magma at di erent depths and at di erent times. Each of these pods will have its unique Sr isotopic ratios. Coalescence of   these small pods of magma without any e ective homogenization due to deformation-induced fast segregation, ascent and emplacement may lead to pluton-wide extreme heterogeneity in Sr isotopic ratios.</p>

					<p>$^{40} Ar-^{39}Ar$ analyses of one alkali pyroxenite whole rock and two phlogopite separates of calcite carbonatites from the Sung Valley carbonatite-alkaline complex, which is believed to be a part of the Rajmahal-Bengal-Sylhet (RBS) ood basalt province, yielded indistinguishable plateau ages of $108.8 \pm 2.0Ma, 106:4 \pm 1.3 Ma$ and $107.5 \pm 1.4 Ma$, respectively. The weighted mean of these ages, $107.2 \pm 0.8 Ma$, is the time of emplacement of this complex. This implies that Sung Valley complex and probably other such complexes in the Assam-Meghalaya Plateau postdate the main ood basalt event (i.e., the eruption of tholeiites) in the RBS province by $\sim 10 Ma$.</p>

				<title>Development of micro-scale joints in volcanic rocks under thermal stress</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0191-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Petrographic studies of samples of the Rajmahal basalt reveal a variety of microscopic joints within phenocrysts, which seem to have developed under the in uence of thermal stresses during cooling. The theoretical analysis shows that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>thermal stresses develop in a system only under unsteady state of cooling,</li>
						<li>the stresses responsible for the development of joints are tensile in nature, and</li>
						<li>the magnitude of stresses increases with increasing rates of cooling.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In order to understand the effects of cooling rate on the mode of jointing, analogue model experiments were performed by quenching melt films of organic, crystalline materials under varying cooling conditions. In experiments, non-branching linear joints developed at relatively lower rates of cooling by a process of sub-critical crack propagation. On the other hand, at higher rates of cooling the mechanism of crack propagation was essentially supercritical leading to the development of branching joints.</p>

				<title>Scattering of a spherical pulse from a small inhomogeneity: Dilation and rotation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0205-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Perturbations in elastic constants and density distinguish a volume inhomogeneity from its homogeneous surroundings. The equation of motion for the first order scattering is studied in the perturbed medium. The scattered waves are generated by the interaction between the primary waves and the inhomogeneity. First order scattering theory is modified to include the source term generating the primary waves. The body force equivalent to the scattering source is presented in a convenient form involving the perturbations in wave velocities and gradient of density perturbation.</p>
					<p>A procedure is presented to study the scattering of a spherical pulse from a small inhomogeneity, in time domain. The size of inhomogeneity is assumed small as compared to its distance from source and receiver. No restrictions are placed on the positions of source, receiver and inhomogeneity. The dilatation and rotations are calculated for a pulse scattered from an arbitrary point in a spherical volume. The aggregate of the scattered phases from all the points of the inhomogeneity, reaching at a fixed receiver, gives the amount of scattering from the inhomogeneity. The interaction of both P and S waves with inhomogeneity are considered. Dilatation and rotations for scattering are obtained as integral expressions over the solid angle of inhomogeneity. These expressions are computed numerically, for hypothetical models. The effects of source (unit force) orientations, velocity and density perturbations, and size of inhomogeneity, on the scattered phases, are discussed.</p>

				<title>Estimation of surface latent heat fluxes from IRS-P4/MSMR satellite data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0231-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The brightness temperatures of the Microwave sensor MSMR (Multichannel Scanning Microwave Radiometer) launched in May 1999 onboard Indian Oceansat-1 IRS-P4 are used to develop a direct retrieval method for latent heat ux by multivariate regression technique. The MSMR measures the microwave radiances at 8 channels at frequencies of 6.6, 10.7, 18 and 21 GHz at both vertical and horizontal polarizations. It is found that the surface LHF (Latent Heat Flux) is sensitive to all the channels. The coeficients were derived using the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data of three months: July, September, November of 1999. The NCEP daily analyzed latent heat uxes and brightness temperatures observed by MSMR were used to derive the coeficients. Validity of the derived coeficients was checked with \textit {in situ} observations over the Indian Ocean and with NCEP analyzed LHF for global points. The LHF derived directly from the MSMR brightness temperature (Tb) yielded an accuracy of 35 watt/ $m^2$. LHF was also computed by applying bulk formula using the geophysical parameters extracted from MSMR. In this case the errors were higher apparently due to the errors involved in derivation of the geophysical parameters.</p>

				<title>Influence of micrometeorological features on coastal boundary layer aerosol characteristics at the tropical station, Trivandrum</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0247-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Characteristics of aerosols in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) obtained from a bistatic CW lidar at Trivandrum for the last one decade are used to investigate the role of ABL micro- meteorological processes in controlling the altitude distribution and size spectrum. The altitude structure of number density shows three distinct zones depending on the prevailing boundary layer feature; viz, the well-mixed region, entertainment region and upper mixing region. In the lower altitudes vertical mixing is very strong (the well-mixed region) the upper limit of which is defined as aerosol-mixing height, is closely associated with the low level inversion. The aerosol mixing height generally lies in the range 150 to 400 m showing a strong dependence on the vertical eddy mixing processes in ABL. Above this altitude, the number density decreases almost exponentially with increase in altitude with a scale height of 0.5 --1.5 km. The aerosol mixing height is closely associated with the height of the Thermal Internal Boundary Layer (TIBL). Sea-spray aerosols generated as a result of the interaction of surface wind with sea surface forms an important component of mixing  region aerosols at this location. This component shows a non-linear dependence on wind speed. On an average, depending on the season, the mixing region contributes about 10--30% of the columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) at $0.5 \mu m$ wavelength. A long term increasing trend ($\sim 2.8%$ per year) is observed in mixing region AOD from 1989 to 1997. A study on the development of the aerosols in the nocturnal mixing region shows that the convectively driven daytime altitude structure continues to persist for about 4--5 hrs. after the sunset and thereafter the altitude structure is governed by vertical structure of horizontal wind. Stratified aerosol layers associated with stratified turbulence is very common during the late night hours.</p>

				<title>Earth support systems: Threatened? Why? What can we do?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0269-0285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The most important concept to emerge in the 20th century was the recognition that sustainability is threatened. A sustainable society is one that functions and lives in such harmony with earth systems that future generations will be able to function with equal or greater ease and the quality of life will in no way be diminished.</p>
					<p>Evidence of threats to sustainability is found in: global energy use; global climate change; availability of sufficient safe water; degradation of soil on agricultural lands; food production for a global population of 9,000 million by 2050; accelerated extinction rates and loss of biodiversity; human under- and over-nourishment; and the spread of diseases.</p>
					<p>Ignorance borne of alienation from nature deprives us of sensitivity to the threats human activities cause. Alienation may be traced to the agricultural revolution, but has become widespread and even inescapable for many with massive control of energy and the industrial revolution, dependence on machines, and urbanization. With the control of enough energy to dominate nature and the achievement of a high, but transient, level of wealth, a world view extolling growth - led by the highly industrialized nations, but now being emulated in the developing countries - has committed the world to an unsustainable path.</p>
					<p>Because of this, world societies must work to find practical "sustainability" world views to help guide our future choices. Wise choices will depend upon good scientiffic understanding and must be based upon a deep respect for the non-human world and a concern for the future. The environmental meaning of different world views, whether founded in the world religions or in non-religious philosophy, share a common concern to promote an equitable, harmonious, and sustainable relationship between humanity and nature. The similarities in pragmatic meaning in relation to nature of, e.g., Christian stewardship and Deep Ecology, illustrate this.</p>
					<p>Our attention must not be directed towards alternative symbolic or linguistic vocabularies, but toward the practical environmental commitments that different world views entail. Our problems have global reach and many of them are urgent, but they are not intrinsically unsolvable. We must seek ways to find and use common ground in the search for sustainability. We must work together, but remember that each of us contributes to the final outcome.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Metavolcanic rocks containing low-Ca amphiboles (gedrite, cummingtonite) and biotite can undergo substantial dehydration-melting. This is likely to be most prominent in Barrovian Facies Series (kyanite-sillimanite) and occurs at the same time as widespread metapelite dehydration- melting. In lower pressure facies series, metavolcanics will be represented by granulites rich in orthopyroxene when dehydration occurs at much lower temperatures than melting. In higher pressure facies series it is not well known whether metavolcanic rocks dehydrate or melt at temperatures lower or similar to that of metapelites.</p>

				<title>Some aspects of the role of intergranular fluids in the compositional evolution of metamorphic rocks</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0293-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Minerals that react with each other during the progressive evolution of metamorphic terranes are not always in physical contact. As such, an "intergranular fluid" could play a major role in element transfer and chemical evolution. However, the nature of this uid and its specific role remains somewhat elusive. Recent experiments in our laboratory shed some light on the behavior of such a uid. Here we present a simple mathematical model which accounts for diffusion within crystals and fluid, solubility in the fluid and mass balance between the various reservoirs. The model elucidates the nature of element exchange between two minerals via the mediation of an intergranular fluid. It is shown that a coupling of thermodynamics and kinetics controls the evolution of the system and the concentration of an element in the intergranular fluid is a key parameter of interest.</p>
					<p>The results have important implications for standard tools of metamorphic petrology such as geothermometers and barometers, geospeedometry and the closure of isotopic systems. For example, homogeneity of mineral grains may be a poor criterion for equilibrium and the rim compositions of minerals showing diffusion zoning may be out of equilibrium with distant exchange partners, even in the presence of a uid in which transport is fast.</p>

				<title>Reaction texture and Fe-Mg zoning in granulite garnet from S$\phi $strene Island, Antarctica: Modeling and constraint on the time scale of metamorphism during the Pan-African Collisional event</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0305-0312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Garnets from the S$\phi $strene island, Antarctica, show reaction textures corresponding to two metamorphic episodes, one at c. 1000 Ma (M1) and the other at c. 500 Ma (M2). The latter is associated with a Pan-African tectono-metamorphic event that has been interpreted to represent a continent-continent collision followed by extensional collapse. Reaction-diffusion modeling of the compositional zoning of garnet associated with the development of reaction texture during M2 yields a time scale of $\sim $5--16 Myr for the duration of the peak of this overprinting metamorphism at $\sim 730\pm 20^\circ C$. The associated velocity of the reaction front is $\sim \sim 5.0--1.6 \mu m/Myr$. The inferred duration of peak metamorphism during the Pan-African event seems to be in good agreement with the available U-Pb SHRIMP ages of zircon and monazite that may be interpreted to have formed at the beginning and end stages of crystallization of granite during the metamorphic peak.</p>

				<title>Orogeny, migmatites and leucogranites: A review</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0313-0336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The type of P-T-t path and availability of fluid ($H_2$O-rich metamorphic volatile phase or melt) are important variables in metamorphism. Collisional orogens are characterized by clockwise P-T evolution, which means that in the core, where temperatures exceed the wet solidus for common crustal rocks, melt may be present throughout a significant portion of the evolution. Field observations of eroded orogens show that lower crust is migmatitic, and geophysical observations have been interpreted to suggest the presence of melt in active orogens. A consequence of these results is that orogenic collapse in mature orogens may be controlled by a partially-molten layer that decouples weak crust from subducting lithosphere, and such a weak layer may enable exhumation of deeply buried crust. Migmatites provide a record of melt segregation in partially molten crustal materials and syn-anatectic deformation under natural conditions. Grain boundary ow and intra- and inter-grain fracture ow are the principal grain scale melt ow mechanisms. Field observations of migmatites in ancient orogens show that leucosomes occur oriented in the metamorphic fabrics or are located in dilational sites. These observations are interpreted to suggest that melt segregation and extraction are syntectonic processes, and that melt migration pathways commonly relate to rock fabrics and structures. Thus, leucosomes in depleted migmatites record the remnant permeability network, but evolution of permeability networks and amplification of anomalies are poorly understood. Deformation of partially molten rocks is accommodated by melt-enhanced granularow, and volumetric strain is accommodated by melt loss. Melt segregation and extraction may be cyclic or continuous, depending on the level of applied differential stress and rate of melt pressure buildup. During clockwise P-T evolution, $H_2$O is transferred from protolith to melt as rocks cross dehydration melting reactions, and $H_2$O may be evolved above the solidus at low P by crossing supra-solidus decompression-dehydration reactions if micas are still present in the depleted protolith. $H_2$O dissolved in melt is transported through the crust to be exsolved on crystallization. This recycled $H_2$O may promote wet melting at supra-solidus conditions and retrogression at sub-solidus conditions. The common growth of `late' muscovite over sillimanite in migmatite may be the result of this process, and in ux of exogenous $H_2$O may not be necessary. However, in general, metasomatism in the evolution of the crust remains a contentious issue. Processes in the lower-most crust may be inferred from studies of xenolith suites brought to the surface in lavas. Based on geochemical data, we can use statistical methods and modeling to evaluate whether migmatites are sources or feeder zones for granites, or simply segregated melt that was stagnant in residue, and to compare xenoliths of inferred lower crust with exposed deep crust. Upper-crustal granites are a necessary complement to melt-depleted granulites common in the lower crust, but the role of mafic magma in crustal melting remains uncertain. Plutons occur at various depths above and below the brittle-to-viscous transition in the crust and have a variety of 3-D shapes that may vary systematically with depth. The switch from ascent to emplacement may be caused by amplification of instabilities within (permeability, magma ow rate) or surrounding (strength or state of stress) the ascent column, or by the ascending magma intersecting some discontinuity in the crust that enables horizontal magma emplacement followed by thickening during pluton inflation. Feedback relations between rates of pluton filling, magma ascent and melt extraction maintain compatibility among these processes.</p>

				<page>0337-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The charnockite patches that occur within leptynite host, in and around Jenapore, northern sector of the Eastern Ghats granulite belt, are disposed in a linear fashion and generally have sharp lithological contact with the host leptynite. Sometimes the patches and foliations of the host are cofolded. Also, the patches sometimes have the internal $S_1$ foliation, while the host leptynite records only $S_2$ foliation. Mineralogically and chemically patchy charnockites and host leptynites are distinct entities, and cannot be related by any prograde and retrograde reactions. Particularly important is the peraluminous granitic composition and high Rb/Sr ratios of the leptynites, presumably resulting from biotite-dehydration melting; as against metaluminous granodioritic to tonalitic composition and low Rb/Sr ratios of the patchy charnockites, presumably resulting from hornblende-dehydration melting. The charnockite patches here can be interpreted as caught up patches or xenolith within granitic melt (leptynite). Mg-rich rims of garnet in the charnockite patch were probably caused by heat from the crystallising melt or decompression during ascent of melt.</p>

				<title>Evolution of the Bhandara-Balaghat granulite belt along the southern margin of the Sausar Mobile Belt of central India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0351-0368</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Bhandara-Balaghat granulite (BBG) belt occurs as a 190 km long, detached narrow, linear, NE{SW to ENE{WSW trending belt that is in tectonic contact on its northern margin with the Sausar Group of rocks and is bordered by the Sakoli fold belt in the south. The Bhandara part of the BBG belt is quite restricted, comprising a medium to coarse grained two-pyroxene granulite body that is of gabbroic composition and preserves relic igneous fabric. The main part of the belt in Arjuni-Balaghat section includes metasedimentary (quartzite, BIF, Al- and Mg-Al metapelites) and metaigneous (metaultramafic, amphibolite and two-pyroxene granulite) protoliths interbanded with charnockite and charnockitic gneiss. These rocks, occurring as small bands and enclaves within migmatitic and granitic gneisses, show polyphase deformation and metamorphism. Geochemically, basic compositions show tholeiitic trend without Fe-enrichment, non-komatitic nature, continental affinity and show evolved nature. Mineral parageneses and reaction textures in different rock compositions indicate early prograde, dehydration melt forming reactions followed by orthopyroxene stability with or without melt. Coronitic and symplectitic garnets have formed over earlier minerals indicating onset of retrograde IBC path. Evidences for high temperature ductile shearing are preserved at places. Retrogressive hydration events clearly post-date the above paths. The present study has shown that the BBG belt may form a part of the Bastar Craton and does not represent exhumed oceanic crust of the Bundelkhand Craton. It is further shown that rocks of the BBG belt have undergone an earlier high-grade granulite metamorphism at $2672 \pm 54 Ma$ (Sm-Nd age) and a post-peak granulite metamorphism at $1416 \pm 59 Ma$ (Sm-Nd age, $1380 \pm 28 Ma$ Rb-Sr age). These events were followed by deposition of the Sausar supracrustals and Neoproterozoic Sausar orogeny between $973 \pm 63 Ma$ and $800 \pm 16 Ma$ (Rb-Sr ages).</p>

				<title>A reappraisal of polymetamorphism in the Eastern Ghats belt - A view from north of the Godavari rift</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0369-0383</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Evidence collated from different parts of the Eastern Ghats belt north of the Godavari rift (barring the "Western Charnockite Zone") indicates that this sector evolved through a series of compressive structures ($F_1$ to $F_3$), with prolific migmatization in quartzofeldspathic and metapelitic gneisses synchronous with $F_1$ shortening, as was the $syn- F_1$ emplacement of profuse megacrystic K-feldspar-bearing granitoid bodies. Thereafter, melt productivity of the rocks (synchronous with $F_2 - F_3$ folding) sharply decreased. Mineral parageneses stable in the $S_1, S_2$ and $S_3$ fabrics indicate persistence of granulite facies conditions. P-T estimates on orthopyroxene $+$ garnet $+$ plagioclase $+$ quartz assemblages anchored to recrystallized mosaic that overgrow all penetrative fabric elements in mafic granulites, granitoids and quartzofeldspathic gneisses are in the range of $900^\circ -950^\circ C$ and $P \cong 8-9$ kbar. This estimate is comparable to those retrieved from sapphirine-bearing paragenesis in Mg-Al metapelites that appear to be diachronous in relation to the fabric elements, and arguably disrupt the granoblastic mosaic. These facets in the northern sector of the orogenic belt are compatible with either a single cycle of tectonic events (i.e., $F_1, F_2$ and $F_3$ in continuum), or temporally-separate thermo-tectonic events, with the peak of earlier metamorphism (pre- to $syn- F_1$) at lower temperature (in the granulite facies) in comparison to the record of high $post-F_3-T_{max}$ values.</p>
					<p>It is suggested on the basis of the above evidence that the late Proterozoic/Pan-African granulites in the Eastern Ghats belt north of the Godavari rift, are unlikely to be reworked equivalents of any older granulitic crust, such as the $\sim 1.6$ Ga granulites south of the rift. Instead, the temporally disparate sectors may represent different crustal segments with unconnected pre-amalgamation tectonic history. However, if the $\sim 1.6$ Ga granulites of the Western Charnockite Zone continue northwards across the rift, as suggested by recent isotope data, there are serious doubts as to the validity of a north-south division within the Eastern Ghats belt.</p>

				<title>U-Pb age of the Diana Complex and Adirondack granulite petrogenesis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0385-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>U-Pb isotopic analyses of eight single and multi-grain zircon fractions separated from a syenite of the Diana Complex of the Adirondack Mountains do not define a single linear array, but a scatter along a chord that intersects the Concordia curve at $1145 \pm 29$ and $285 \pm 204$ Ma. For the most concordant analyses, the $^{207}Pb/ ^{206}Pb$ ages range between 1115 and 1150 Ma. Detailed petrographic studies revealed that most grains contained at least two phases of zircon growth, either primary magmatic cores enclosed by variable thickness of metamorphic overgrowths or magmatic portions enclosing presumably older xenocrystic zircon cores. The magmatic portions are characterized by typical dipyramidal prismatic zoning and numerous black inclusions that make them quite distinct from adjacent overgrowths or cores when observed in polarizing light microscopy and in back- scattered electron micrographs. Careful handpicking and analysis of the "best" magmatic grains, devoid of visible overgrowth of core material, produced two nearly concordant points that along with two of the multi-grain analyses yielded an upper-intercept age of $1118 \pm 2.8$ Ma and a lower- intercept age of $251 \pm 13$ Ma. The older age is interpreted as the crystallization age of the syenite and the younger one is consistent with late stage uplift of the Appalachian region. The 1118 Ma age for the Diana Complex, some 35 Ma younger than previously believed, is now approximately synchronous with the main Adirondack anorthosite intrusion, implying a cogenetic relationship among the various meta-igneous rocks of the Adirondacks. The retention of a high-temperature contact metamorphic aureole around Diana convincingly places the timing of Adirondack regional metamorphism as early as 1118 Ma. This result also implies that the sources of anomalous high- temperature during granulite metamorphism are the syn-metamorphic intrusions, such as the Diana Complex.</p>

				<title>The Rajahmundry Traps, Andhra Pradesh: Evaluation of their petrogenesis relative to the Deccan Traps</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0397-0407</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geochemical and geochronological data for rocks from the Rajahmundry Traps, are evaluated for possible correlation with the main Deccan province. Lava flows are found on both banks of the Godavari River and contain an intertrappean sedimentary layer. Based on $^{40}Ar/ ^{39}Ar$ age data, rocks on the east bank are post K-T boundary, show normal magnetic polarity, and belong to chron 29N. Their chemistry is identical to lavas in the Mahabaleshwar Formation in the Western Ghats, $\sim 1000$ km away. It was suggested earlier that the genetic link between these geographically widely separated rocks resulted from lava owing down freshly incised river canyons at $\sim 64$ Ma. For the west bank rocks, recent paleomagnetic work indicates lava flows below and above the intertrappean (sedimentary) layer show reversed and normal magnetic polarity, respectively. The chemical composition of the west bank ow above the intertrappean layer is identical to rocks on the east bank. The west bank lava lying below the sedimentary layer, shows chemistry similar to Ambenali Formation lava ows in the western Deccan. $^{40}Ar/ ^{39}Ar$ dating and complete chemical characterization of this ow is required to elucidate its petrogenesis with respect to the main Deccan Province.</p>

				<title>Generation of Deccan Trap magmas</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0409-0431</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deccan Trap magmas may have erupted through multiple centers, the most prominent of which may have been a shield volcano-like structure in the Western Ghats area. The lavas are predominantly tholeiitic; alkalic mafic lavas and carbonatites are rare. Radioisotope dating, magnetic chronology, and age constraints from paleontology indicate that although the eruption started some 68 Ma, the bulk of lavas erupted at around 65-66 Ma. Paleomagnetic constraints indicate an uncertainty of $\pm 500,000$ years for peak volcanic activity at 65 m.y. in the type section of the Western Ghats. Maximum magma residence times were calculated in this study based on growth rates of   "giantplagioclase" crystals in lavas that marked the end phase of volcanic activity of different magma chambers. These calculations suggest that the &gt 1.7 km thick Western Ghats section might have erupted within a much shorter time interval of $\sim 55,000$ years, implying phenomenal eruption rates that are orders of magnitude larger than any present-day eruption rate from any tectonic environment. Other significant observations/conclusions are as follows: (1) Deccan lavas can be grouped into stratigraphic subdivisions based on their geochemistry; (2) While some formations are relatively uncontaminated others are strongly contaminated by the continental crust; (3) Deccan magmas were produced by 15-30% melting of a Fe-rich lherzolitic source at $\sim 3--2$ GPa; (4) Parent magmas of the relatively uncontaminated Ambenali formation had a primitive composition with 16% MgO, 47% $SiO_2$; (5) Deccan magmas were generated much deeper and by significantly more melting than other continental flood basalt provinces; (6) The erupted Deccan tholeiitic lavas underwent fractionation and magma mixing at $\sim 0.2$ GPa. The composition and origin of the crust and crust/mantle boundary beneath the Deccan are discussed with respect to the in uence of Deccan magmatic episode.</p>

				<title>Petrology, geochemistry and tectonic settings of the mafic dikes and sills associated with the evolution of the Proterozoic Cuddapah Basin of south India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0433-0453</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article we summarize the petrological, geochemical and tectonic processes involved in the evolution of the Proterozoic intracratonic Cuddapah basin. We use new and available ages of Cuddapah igneous rocks, together with field, stratigraphic, geophysical and other criteria, to arrive at a plausible model for the timing of these processes during basin evolution. We present petrological and geochronological evidence of dike emplacement along preferred lineament directions around the basin in response to stresses, which may have been responsible for the evolution of the basin itself. Basaltic dike intrusion started on the south Indian shield around 2400 Ma and continued throughout the Cuddapah basin evolution and sedimentation. A deep mantle perturbation, currently manifested by a lopolithic cupola-like intrusion under the southwestern part of the basin, may have occurred at the onset of basin evolution and played an important role in its development. Paleomagnetic, gravity and geochronological evidence indicates that it was a constant thermal source responsible for dike and sill emplacement between 1500 and 1200 Ma both inside and outside the basin. Lineament reactivation in the NW{SE and NE{SW directions, in response to the mantle perturbation, intensified between 1400 and 1200 Ma, leading to the emplacement of several cross cutting dikes.</p>
					<p>Fe-Mg partition coefficients of olivine and augite and Ca-Na partition coefficient of plagioclase, calculated from the composition of these minerals and bulk composition of their host rocks, indicate that the dikes outside the Cuddapah basin are cumulates. The contemporary dikes may be related by fractional crystallization as indicated by a positive correlation between their plagioclase Ca#(atomic Ca/[Ca$+$Na]) and augite Mg# (atomic Mg/[Mg$+$Fe]). A few NW--SE and NE--SW cross cutting dikes of the period between 1400 and 1200 Ma, preserve petrographic evidence of episodic magmatic intrusive activity along preferred directions. Petrological reasoning indicates that a magmatic liquid reacted with a set of cross cutting dikes, intruding into one that was already solidified and altering the composition of the magma that produced the other dike.</p>
					<p>The Cuddapah basin tholeiites may be related by fractional crystallization at 5 kb and $1019-1154^\circ C$, which occurred in the lopolithic cupola near the southwestern margin of the basin. Xenolith bearing picrites, which occur near the periphery of the cupola, originated by the accumulation of xenoliths in the tholeiites. This is indicated by the composition of the olivine in the xenoliths ($Fo_{78.7â81.9}$), which are closely similar to calculated olivine compositions ($Fo_{77.8â78.3}$) in equilibrium with the tholeiites under the same \textit {P-T} conditions. It is inferred that fractionation in the cupola resulted in crystals settling on its walls. Hence, the xenolith-bearing sills occur at the periphery of the lopolithic body.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aftershock sequence of the September 30th, 1993 Killari earthquake in the Latur district of Maharashtra state, India, recorded by 41 temporary seismograph stations are used for estimating 3-D velocity structure in the epicentral area. The local earthquake tomography (LET) method of Thurber (1983) is used. About 1500 \textit {P} and 1200 \textit {S} wave travel-times are inverted. The \textit {P} and \textit {S} wave velocities as well as $V_P /V_S$ ratio vary more rapidly in the vertical as well as in the horizontal directions in the source region compared to the adjacent areas. The main shock hypocentre is located at the junction of a high velocity and a low velocity zone, representing a fault zone at 6 - 7 km depth. The estimated average errors of \textit {P} velocity and $V_P / V_S$ ratio are $\pm 0.07 km/s$ and $\pm 0.016$, respectively. The best resolution of \textit {P} and \textit {S}-wave velocities is obtained in the aftershock zone. The 3-D velocity structure and precise locations of the aftershocks suggest a `stationary concept' of the Killari earthquake sequence.</p>

				<title>Formation of diapiric structure in the deformation zone, central Indian Ocean: A model from gravity and seismic reflection data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analyses of bathymetry, gravity and seismic reflection data of the diffusive plate boundary in the central Indian Ocean reveal a new kind of deformed structure besides the well-reported structures of long-wavelength anticlinal basement rises and high-angle reverse faults. The structure (basement trough) has a length of about 150 km and deepens by up to 1 km from its regional trend (northward dipping). The basement trough includes a rise at its center with a height of about 1.5 km. The rise is about 10 km wide with rounded upper surface and bounded by vertical faults. A broad free-air gravity low of about 20 mGal and a local high of 8 mGal in its center are associated with the identified basement trough and rise structure respectively. Seismic results reveal that the horizontal crustal compression prevailing in the diffusive plate boundary might have formed the basement trough possibly in early Pliocene time. Differential loading stresses have been generated from unequal crust/sediment thickness on lower crustal and upper mantle rocks. A thin semi-ductile serpentinite layer existing near the base of the crust that is interpreted to have been formed at mid-ocean ridge and become part of the lithosphere, may have responded to the downward loading stresses generated by the sediments and crustal rocks to inject the serpentinites into the overlying strata to form a classic diapiric structure.</p>

				<title>Records of climatic changes and volcanic events in an ice core from Central Dronning Maud Land (East Antarctica) during the past century</title>

				<page>0039-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The depth profiles of electrical conductance, $\delta ^{18}O, ^{210}Pb$ and cosmogenic radio isotopes ${10}Be$ and $^{36}Cl$ have been measured in a 30 m ice core from east Antarctica near the Indian station, Dakshin Gangotri. Using $^{210}Pb$ and $\delta ^{18}O$, the mean annual accumulation rates have been calculated to be 20 and 21 cm of ice equivalent per year during the past $\sim 150$ years. Using these acumulation rates, the volcanic event that occurred in 1815 AD, has been identified based on electrical conductance measurements. Based on $\delta {18}O$ measurements, the mean annual surface air temperatures (MASAT) data observed during the last 150 years indicates that the beginning of the 19th century was cooler by about $2^\circ C$ than the recent past and the middle of 18th century. The fallout of cosmogenic radio isotope $^{10}Be$ compares reasonably well with those obtained on other stations ($73^circ S to 90^\circ S$) from Antarctica and higher latitudes beyond $77^\circ N$. The fallout of $^[36}Cl$ calculated based on the present work agrees well with the mean global production rate estimated earlier by Lal and Peters (1967) The bomb pulse of $^{36}Cl$ observed in Greenland is not observed in the present studies { a result which is puzzling and needs to be studied on neighbouring ice cores from the same region.</p>

				<title>Velocity of small-scale auroral ionospheric current systems over Indian Antarctic station Maitri</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0051-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian Antarctic station Maitri (geog. $70^\circ 45/S, 11^\circ 45/E, geom. 66^\circ .03S, 53^\circ.21E$) occupies a sub-auroral location during magnetically quiet conditions ($\sigma Kp &lt; 10$), but attains an auroral position when the auroral oval shifts equatorwards with increasing strength of magnetic disturbance. At the latter times, triangulation with 3 uxgate magnetometers located at the vertices of a suitable triangle provides a means of monitoring mobile auroral ionospheric current systems over Maitri. The spacing between the magnetometers is typically kept at 75-200 km, keeping in mind the scale-sizes of $\sim 100$ km for these mobile current systems. This work reports the results of two triangulation experiments carried out around Maitri in January 1992 and January 1995, both during Antarctic summer. The velocities estimated for pulsations of the Pc4 and Pc5 type were about 0.59 km/sec in the direction $102^\circ .7$ east of due north, in the first case, and about 1-3 km/sec in the second case in the east-west direction.</p>
					<p>While several magnetometer arrays exist in the northern auroral regions (e.g., the Alberta array in Canada, the Alaskan array in the U.S. and the IMS Scandinavian array), there is no report in literature of triangulation through arrays in Antarctica, except for a one-day study by Neudegg \textit {et al} 1995 for ULF pulsations of the Pc1 and Pc2 type. The velocities obtained for the Pi3 type of irregular pulsations over Antarctica in the present study tally well with those obtained for northern auroral locations.</p>

				<page>0063-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Atmospheric boundary layer observations are conducted at a coastal site during a transition phase from winter to summer season over the Indian peninsula. Thermal Internal Boundary Layer (TIBL) characteristics in presence of an off-shore and a weakly in uenced on-shore synoptic wind are examined with the help of measurements carried out with a mini-SODAR (SOund Detection And Ranging), tethered balloon, and tower-based micrometeorological measurements. In uence of the changing synoptic scale conditions on turbulent characteristics of TIBL is discussed.</p>
					<p>Mini-SODAR data showed the development and decay of sea and land breeze. It is seen that the characteristics of TIBL over the coastal land after sea breeze onset are similar to that of a shallow convective boundary layer (CBL) commonly found over plain land. Inside the TIBL, a maximum wind speed was noted close to the surface due to the penetration of sea breeze. In the off-shore case, a distinct sea breeze circulation was observed unlike in the case of on-shore ow. In the presence of weak on-shore case, a `minor sea' breeze is noted before the establishment of sea breeze and a reduction in the momentum uxes gives rise to decrease in the turbulence intensity. Updraft in the sea breeze front was stronger during weak synoptic conditions. In uence of synoptic changes on the sea breeze-land breeze circulation such as onset, strength and duration of the sea-land breeze are also examined.</p>

					<p>Syngenetic carbonate nodules constitute an interesting feature of the glaciogene sediments of various Talchir basins in peninsular India. Petrographic, cathodoluminescence and sedimentary results suggest that many of these nodules contain primary carbonate precipitates whose geochemical signatures can be used for determining environment of deposition and provenance of the sediments and drainage source. Several nodules were collected from Gondwana basins of east-central India and analyzed for stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios, REE and trace element composition, and Sr isotope ratio. The mean $\delta ^{18}O$ and $\delta ^{13}C$ values of the calcites in the nodules are -- 19.5â° and --9.7â° (w.r.t. PDB) respectively suggesting a freshwater environment (probably lacustrine) for formation of these objects. Trace element ratios (Eu/Eu$^\ast$ and La/Yb) of the nodule samples show that the source of the sediments in the Damodar valley basin was the granites, gneisses and intrusives in the Chotanagpur region. The sediments in the Mahanadi valley were derived from granulites, charnockites and granites of the eastern ghat region. The Sr concentration of the carbonate phase of the nodules is low, ranging from 10--60 ng/g . The $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$ ratios of the samples from the west Bokaro basin and Ramgarh basin vary from 0.735 to 0.748 (mean: 0.739) and from 0.726 to 0.733 (mean: 0.730) respectively. These values are consistent with our proposition that water of these basins drained through the granitic rocks of the Chotanagpur region. In contrast, the $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$ ratios of the samples from the Talchir basin (Type area) of Mahanadi valley vary from 0.718 to 0.723 (mean: 0.719). These $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$ ratios are close to those of the granulites in the adjoining eastern ghat belt suggesting that area as the drainage source.</p>

				<title>Electron spin resonance dating of fault gouge from Desamangalam, Kerala: Evidence for Quaternary movement in Palghat gap shear zone</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0103-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The field investigations in the epicentral area of the 1994 Wadakkancheri (Desamangalam), Kerala, earthquake (M 4.3) indicate subtle, but clearly recognizable expressions of geologically recent fault zone, consisting of fracture sets showing brittle displacement and a gouge zone. The fracture zone confines to the crystalline basement, and is spatially coincident with the elongation of the isoseismals of the 1994 mainshock and a 10-km-long WNW-ESE trending topographic lineament. The preliminary results from the electron spin resonance (ESR) dating on the quartz grains from the fault gouge indicate that the last major faulting in this site occurred $430 \pm 43 ka$ ago. The experiments on different grain sizes of quartz from the gouge showed consistent decrease in age to a plateau of low values, indicating that ESR signals in finer grains were completely zeroed at the time of faulting due to frictional heat. The results show a relatively young age for displacement on the fault that occurs within a Precambrian shear zone. Discrete reactivated faults in such areas may be characterized by low degree of activity, but considering the ESR age of the last significant faulting event, the structure at Desamangalam may be categorized as a potentially active fault capable of generating moderate earthquakes, separated by very long periods of quiescence.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A review of the available radiometric and paleomagnetic data from the Deccan Flood Basalt Province (DFBP) suggests that the volcanism was episodic in nature and probably continued over an extended duration from 69Ma to 63Ma between 31R and 28N. It is likely that the most intense pulse of volcanism at $66.9 \pm 0.2Ma$ preceded the Cretaceous Tertiary Boundary (KTB, $65.2 \pm 0.2Ma$) events by $\sim 1.7Ma$. The magnetostratigraphic record in the Deccan lava pile is incomplete and it is therefore possible that the lava ows constituting the reverse polarity sequence were erupted in more than one reversed magnetic chron.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Static deformation of two monoclinic elastic half-spaces in welded contact due to a long inclined strike-slip fault situated in one of the half-spaces is studied analytically and numerically. Closedform algebraic expressions for the displacement at any point of the medium are obtained. The variation of the displacement at the interface with the horizontal distance from the fault is studied. The effect of anisotropy on the displacement field is examined. It is found that while the anisotropy of the source half-space has a significant effect on the displacement at the interface, the anisotropy of the other half-space has only a marginal effect.</p>

					<p>Eigenvalue approach, following Laplace and Fourier transforms, has been employed to find the general solution to the field equations in an anisotropic liquid-saturated porous medium, in the transformed domain. The results of isotropic liquid-saturated porous medium can be derived as a special case. A numerical inversion technique has been applied to get the solutions in the physical domain. To illustrate the utility of the approach, an application of infinite space with impulsive force at the origin has been considered.

				<title>Momentum transport of wave zero during March: A possible predictor for the Indian summer monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0153-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analysis of monthly momentum transport of zonal waves at 850 hPa for the period 1979 to 1993, between $30^\circ S$ and $30^\circ N$ for January to April, using zonal (\textit {u}) and meridional ($\upsilon $) components of wind taken from the ECMWF reanalysis field, shows a positive correlation (.1% level of significance) between the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (June through September) and the momentum transport of wave zero TM(0) over latitudinal belt between $25^\circ S$ and $5^\circ N$ (LB) during March. Northward (Southward) TM(0) observed in March over LB subsequently leads to a good (drought) monsoon season over India which is found to be true even when the year is marked with the El- Nino event. Similarly a strong westerly zone in the Indian Ocean during March, indicates a good monsoon season for the country, even if the year is marked with El-Nino. The study thus suggests two predictors, TM(0) over LB and the strength of westerly zone in the Indian Ocean during March.</p>

				<title>Seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton pigment in the Laccadive (Lakshadweep) Sea as observed by the Coastal Zone Color Scanner</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0163-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Based on Coastal Zone Color Scanner data from November 1978 through December 1981, the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton pigment in the upper part of the euphotic zone is established for the off shore Laccadive Sea. Year-round, the pigment content is low and the seasonal range is small, following the pattern of the nutrient-poor Arabian Sea to the west. Apparently, indigenous phytoplankton blooms are absent. July and August, however, were poorly studied because of cloud cover. Interannual differences during the northeast monsoon and the spring intermonsoon periods are minor. The abundant phytoplankton caused by the upwelling off India during the southwest monsoon remains essentially restricted to the shelf, but there are occasional large, zonal outbreaks into the Laccadive Sea, as well as others advected to the south of India. Visual inspection of the raw CZCS scenes for June through November 1982-1985, with almost no data until August or even September, shows such outbreaks of pigment-rich water to be common. Inspection of monthly SeaWiFS images for 1997 through part of 2001 confirms the absence of indigenous phytoplankton blooms.</p>

				<title>Retrieval of sea surface velocities using sequential Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0189-0195</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-P4 (Oceansat-I) launched on May 26th, 1999 carried two sensors on board, i.e., the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) and the Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR) dedicated for oceanographic research. Sequential data of IRS-P4 OCM has been analysed over parts of both east and west coast of India and a methodology to retrieve sea surface current velocities has been applied. The method is based on matching suspended sediment dispersion patterns, in sequential two time lapsed images. The pattern matching is performed on a pair of atmospherically corrected and geo-referenced sequential images by Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) technique. The MCC technique involves computing matrices of cross-correlation coe#cients and identifying correlation peaks. The movement of the pattern can be calculated knowing the displacement of windows required to match patterns in successive images. The technique provides actual flow during a specified period by integrating both tidal and wind influences. The current velocities retrieved were compared with synchronous data collected along  the east coast during the GSI cruise ST-133 of R.V. Samudra Kaustubh in January 2000. The current data were measured using the ocean current meter supplied by the Environmental Measurement and CONtrol (EMCON), Kochi available with the Geological Survey of India, Marine Wing. This current meter can measure direction and magnitude with an accuracy of $\pm 5^\circ $ and 2% respectively. The measurement accuracies with coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of 0.99, for both magnitude ($cm.s^{-1}$) and direction (deg.) were achieved.</p>

				<title>Estimation of colored dissolved organic matter and salinity fields in case 2 waters using SeaWiFS: Examples from Florida Bay and Florida Shelf</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0197-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estimates of water quality variables such as chlorophyll \textit {a} concentration (Chl), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), or salinity from satellite sensors are of great interest to resource managers monitoring coastal regions such as the Florida Bay and the Florida Shelf. However, accurate  stimates of these variables using standard ocean color algorithms have been di#cult due to the complex nature of the light field in these environments. In this study, we process SeaWiFS satellite  data using two recently developed algorithms; one for atmospheric correction and the other a semi-analytic bio-optical algorithm and compare the results with standard SeaWiFS algorithms. Overall, the two algorithms produced more realistic estimates of Chl and CDOM distributions in Florida Shelf and Bay waters. Estimates of surface salinity were obtained from the CDOM absorption field assuming a conservative mixing behavior of these waters. A comparison of SeaWiFS-derived Chl and CDOM absorption with field measurements in the Florida Bay indicated that although well correlated, CDOM was underestimated, while Chl was overestimated. Bottom reflectance appeared to affect these estimates at the shallow central Bay stations during the winter. These results demonstrate the need for new bio-optical algorithms or tuning of the parameters used in the bio-optical  algorithm for local conditions encountered in the Bay.</p>

				<page>0209-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Sulu Sea, located between Borneo and the Philippines, is separated from the surrounding ocean by two chains of islands. There are no passages below 500m depth and the basin, which at the deepest is 5,000 m, is filled with warm low oxygen water.</p>
					<p>The near surface chlorophyll concentration has been examined with the aid of ocean colour sensors on board satellites. Direct comparisons between a field observation of chlorophyll and its remotely sensed values from OCTS (Ocean Colour Temperature Scanner) are found to be in satisfactory agreement. An 8-month time series of chlorophyll near the centre of the Sulu Sea has been used to show that the chlorophyll level is significantly higher than the level in the adjacent South China Sea. This was most pronounced at the period of change between the monsoons. The greater primary productivity may provide the explanation for the higher deposition rate of carbon in the Sulu Sea.</p>
					<p>Although the Sulu Sea is more productive than the adjacent South China Sea, the central area can still be classified as a desert. Estimates of the new primary production in the central Sulu Sea seem to be just su#cient to support the current fishery.</p>

				<page>0215-0225</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spatial and temporal variability of pigments was studied from the CZCS satellite data and from \textit {in situ} chlorophyll and transparency for the period 1979--1985. The three Adriatic sites, Northern, Middle, and Southern Adriatic are differently in oceanographic parameters. The differences between seasonal \textit {in situ} chlorophyll and remotely sensed pigment concentrations (from CZCS satellite data) from the Adriatic are large in winter. Through the correlation analysis, pigments were compared to meteo-oceanographic and hydrological parameters from different Adriatic sites. The PCA (principal component analysis) was applied to the pigment data series and significant components were compared. Different correlations are obtained for warm and cold periods of the year pointing to seasonal differences in the underlying mechanism of pigment variability. The first PC is in more parameters seem to in field, than in the cold period. The pigments in the Adriatic are in good correlation to a number of hydrologic and meteo-oceanographic factors.</p>

				<title>Variability of photosynthetic pigments in the Colombian Pacific Ocean and its relationship with the wind field using ADEOS-I data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0227-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Variability of the oceanographic conditions in the Colombian Pacific Ocean, a part of the Panama Basin, is subjected to the variability of wind conditions in the equatorial part of the Pacific Ocean. Data of OCTS and NSCAT of ADEOS-I satellite provided as monthly averages for the period November 1996-- June 1997 by NASDA, were processed and manipulated. A meridional (N--S) component and a zonal (E--W) component were run in order to analyse the data variability and correlation. It is concluded that the variability of the oceanic surface chlorophyll and SST in the Colombian Pacific is a seasonal event related to the migration of the ITCZ and the generation of a wind jet at the Isthmus of Panama. Upwelling due to the wind rotor is present throughout the whole period, with variable spatial distribution and a tendency to be located towards the eastern part of the basin. In a similar way, high chlorophyll concentrations observed in March coincide with both the intensification of the vertical velocities during that month, and the maximal rise of the thermocline in the northern part of the Panama Basin. Picture series of surface chlorophyll, SST, wind stress and Ekman pumping are provided for the studied area.</p>

				<title>Vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient ($K_d$) based optical classification of IRS-P3 MOS-B satellite ocean colour data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0237-0245</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The optical classification of the different water types provides vital input for studies related to primary productivity, water clarity and determination of euphotic depth. Image data of the IRS- P3 MOS-B, for Path 90 of 27th February, 1998 was used for deriving vertical diffuse attenuation Coeffcient ($K_d$) and an optical classification based on $K_d$ values was performed. An atmospheric correction scheme was used for retrieving water leaving radiances in blue and green channels of 412, 443, 490 and 550 nm. The upwelling radiances from 443nm and 550nm spectral channels were used for computation of vertical diffuse attenuation coeffcient $K_d$ at 490 nm. The waters off the Gujarat coast were classified into different water types based on Jerlov classification scheme. The oceanic water type IA ($K_{d}$ range $0.035--0.040m^{-1}$), type IB ($0.042--0.065m^{-1}$), type II ($0.07--0.1m^{-1}$) and type III ($0.115--0.14m^{-1}$) were identified. For the coastal waters along Gujarat coast and Gulf of Kachchh, $K_d$(490) values ranged between $0.15m^{-1}$ and $0.35m^{-1}$. The depth of 1% of surface light for water type IA, IB, II and III corresponds to 88, 68, 58 and 34 meters respectively. Classifica- tion of oceanic and coastal waters based on $K_d$ is useful in understanding the light transmission characteristics for sub-marine navigation and under-water imaging.</p>

				<title>Intercomparison of IRS-P4-MSMR derived geophysical products with DMSP-SSM/I and TRMM-TMI finished products</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0247-0256</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, MSMR geophysical products like Integrated Water Vapour (IWV), Ocean Surface Wind Speed (OWS) and Cloud Liquid Water (CLW) in different grids of 50, 75 and 150 kms are compared with similar products available from other satellites like DMSP-SSM/I and TRMM- TMI. MSMR derived IWV, OWS and CLW compare well with SSM/I and TMI finished products. Comparison of MSMR derived CLW with that derived from TMI and SSM/I is relatively in less agreement. This is possibly due to the use of 37 GHz in SSM/I and TMI that is highly sensitive to CLW, while 37 GHz channels are not available on MSMR. Monthly comparison of MSMR geo- physical products with those from TMI is all carried out for climatological purpose. The monthly comparisons were much better compared to instantaneous comparisons. In this paper, details of the data analysis and comparison results are presented. The usefulness of the MSMR vis-#a-vis other sensors is also discussed.</p>

				<title>Rain rate measurements over global oceans from IRS-P4 MSMR</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0257-0266</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper rain estimation capability of MSMR is explored. MSMR brightness temperature data of six channels corresponding to three frequencies of 10, 18 and 21 GHz are colocated with the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) derived rain rates to find a new empirical algorithm for rain rate by multiple regression. Multiple correlation analysis involving various combinations of channels in linear and non-linear forms and rain rate from TMI is carried out, and thus the best possible algorithm for rain rate measurement was identified which involved V and H polarized brightness temperature measurements at 10 and 18 GHz channels. This algorithm explained about 82 per cent correlation (\textit {r}) with rain rate, and $1.61 mm h^{-1}$ of error of estimation.</p>
					<p>Further, this algorithm is used for generating global average rain rate map for two contrasting months of August (2000) and January (2001) of northern and southern hemispheric summers, respectively. MSMR derived monthly averaged rain rates are compared with similar estimates from TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), and it was found that MSMR derived rain rates match well, quantitatively and qualitatively, with that from PR.</p>

				<title>Wind-driven circulation in the subarctic north Pacific using altimeter data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0267-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-dependent wind-driven circulation in the subarctic north Pacific is investigated by using Topex/Poseidon (T/P) altimeter data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) wind data for about 6 years. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of the T/P- derived sea level anomaly (SLA) without the variation related to the steric height change (SLA1) and the first EOF of the ECMWF-based wind stress curl fields represent basin-sized south-north oscillations and their time series agree well with a correlation of 0.49. They appear to express the spin-up and spin-down of the subarctic gyre. The third EOF of SLA (SLA3) and the second EOF of the wind stress curl are also related to the variation of the subarctic gyre. Though the correlation of their time series is 0.27, drastic changes in early winter coincide well. The two EOF pairs can be considered to mean that the SLA variation followed by the latitudinal migration of the Aleutian low is separated into two standing oscillation patterns, that is, the sea level variation combined with SLA1 and SLA3 expresses seasonal variations of the wind-driven circulation of the subarctic gyre. The interannual SLAs constructed by subtracting the SLA1 and SLA3 components clearly show trans-pacific westward propagation even in the high-latitudes. The time series of SLA1 is in agreement with that of \textit {in situ} SLAs measured with the tide gauge at Petropavlovsk (53-01N, 158-38E), which implies the possibility to monitor the subarctic circulation using tide gauge data.</p>

				<title>Oceanic eddies in synthetic aperture radar images</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0281-0295</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Continuous observations since 1991 by using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on board the Almaz-1, ERS-1/2, JERS-1, and RADARSAT satellites support the well-known fact that oceanic eddies are distributed worldwide in the ocean. The paper is devoted to an evaluation of the potential of SAR for detection of eddies and vortical motions in the ocean. The classification of typical vortical features in the ocean detected in remote sensing images (visible, infrared, and SAR) is presented as well as available information on their spatial and temporal scales. Examples of the Almaz-1 and ERS-1/2 SAR images showing different eddy types, such as rings, spiral eddies of the open ocean, eddies behind islands and in bays, spin-off eddies and mushroom-like structures (vortex dipoles) are given and discussed. It is shown that a common feature for most of the eddies detected in the SAR images is a broad spectrum of spatial scales, spiral shape and shear nature. It is concluded that the spaceborne SARs give valuable information on ocean eddies, especially in combination with visible and infrared satellite data.</p>

				<title>Auto-correlation analysis of ocean surface wind vectors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0297-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nature of the inherent temporal variability of surface winds is analyzed by comparison of winds obtained through different measurement methods. In this work, an auto-correlation analysis of a time series data of surface winds measured \textit {in situ} by a deep water buoy in the Indian Ocean has been carried out. Hourly time series data available for 240 hours in the month of May, 1999 were subjected to an auto-correlation analysis. The analysis indicates an exponential fall of the auto- correlation in the first few hours with a decorrelation time scale of about 6 hours. For a meaningful comparison between satellite derived products and \textit {in situ} data, satellite data acquired at different time intervals should be used with appropriate `weights', rather than treating the data as concurrent in time. This paper presents a scheme for temporal weighting using the auto-correlation analysis. These temporal `weights' can potentially improve the root mean square (rms) deviation between satellite and \textit {in situ} measurements. A case study using the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and Indian Ocean buoy wind speed data resulted in an improvement of about 10%.</p>

				<title>Study of the relationship between non-dimensional roughness length and wave age, effected by wave directionality</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Relationship between the non-dimensional roughness length and inverse of wave age has been discussed without consideration of wave directions, though wind wave field consists of various directional component waves. In this study we observe wave heights by an array of four wave gauges at the Hiratsuka Tower of (Independent Administrative Institution) National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED), Japan, and discuss the effect of wave directionality. As a result, the data sets were classified into two different groups according to the directional wave spectrum distribution. In case 1 only swell and wind waves exist and in case 2 there exist wave components from several directions. It is shown that the case of multiple- directional component waves (case 2) may affect the non-dimensional roughness length and friction velocity.</p>

				<page>0315-0319</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stage A whitecaps (spilling wave crests) have a microwave emissivity of close to 1. Thus if even a small fraction of the sea surface is covered by these features there will be a detectable enhancement in the apparent microwave brightness temperature of that surface as determined by satellite-borne microwave radiometers. This increase in the apparent microwave brightness temperature can as a consequence be routinely used to estimate the fraction of the sea surface covered by stage A whitecaps. For all but the very lowest wind speeds it has been shown in a series of controlled experiments that the air-sea gas transfer coeffcient for each of a wide range of gases, including carbon dioxide and oxygen, is directly proportional to the fraction of the sea surface covered by these stage A whitecaps.</p>

Upwelling of cold water, $4^\circ C$ lower than offshore temperatures appear in April. The upwelling intensifies with the southwest monsoon and is simulated in accordance with \textit {in situ} observations. Upwelling appears to be strongest off Cochin and Quilon, and the upwelling of cold water is seen together with a decrease in salinity in the model simulation.</p>

				<title>Chlorophyll modulation of mixed layer thermodynamics in a mixed-layer isopycnal General Circulation Model - An example from Arabian Sea and equatorial Pacific</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0339-0349</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Western tropical Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and the equatorial Pacific are known as regions of intense bio-chemical-physical interactions: the Arabian Sea has the largest phytoplankton bloom with seasonal signal, while the equatorial Pacific bloom is perennial with quasi-permanent upwelling. Here, we studied three dimensional ocean thermodynamics comparing recent ocean observation with ocean general circulation model (OPYC) experiment combined with remotely sensed chlorophyll pigment concentrations from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS). Using solar radiation parameterization representing observations that a higher abundance of chlorophyll increases absorption of solar irradiance and heating rate in the upper ocean, we showed that the mixed layer thickness decreases more than they would be under clear water conditions. These changes in the model mixed layer were consistent with Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) observations during the 1994--1995 Arabian Sea experiment and epi-fluorescence microscopy (EFM) on samples collected during Equatorial Pacific Ocean Climate Study (EPOCS) in November, 1988. In the Arabian Sea, as the chlorophyll concentrations peak in October ($3mg/m^3$) after the summer plankton bloom induced by coastal upwelling, the chlorophyll induced biological heating enhanced the sea surface temperature (SST) by as much as $0.6^\circ C$ and sub-layer temperature decreases and sub-layer thickness increases. In the equatorial Pacific, modest concentrations of chlorophyll less than $0.3mg/m^3$ is enough to introduce a meridional differential heating, which results in reducing the equatorial mixed layer thickness to more than 20 m. The anomalous meridional tilting of the mixed layer bottom enhances off equatorial westward geostrophic currents. Consequently, the equatorial undercurrent transports more water from west to east. We proposed that these numerical model experiments with use of satellite and \textit {in situ} ocean observations are consistent under three dimensional ocean circulation theory combined with solar radiation transfer process.</p>

				<title>Assimilation of IRS-P4 (MSMR) meteorological data in the NCMRWF global data assimilation system</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0351-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oceansat-1 was successfully launched by India in 1999, with two payloads, namely Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR) and Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) to study the biological and physical parameters of the ocean. The MSMR sensor is configured as an eight-channel radiometer using four frequencies with dual polarization. The MSMR data at 75km resolution from the Oceansat-I have been assimilated in the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) data assimilation forecast system. The operational analysis and forecast system at NCMRWF is based on a T80L18 global spectral model and Spectral Statistical Inter-polation (SSI) scheme for data analysis. The impact of the MSMR data is seen globally, however it is significant over the oceanic region where conventional data are rare. The dry-nature of the control analyses have been removed by utilizing the MSMR data. Therefore, the total precipitable water data from MSMR has been identified as a very crucial parameter in this study. The impact of surface wind speed from MSMR is to increase easterlies over the tropical Indian Ocean. Shifting of the positions of westerly troughs and ridges in the south Indian Ocean has contributed to reduction of temperature to around $30^\circ S$.</p>

				<title>Meteorological fields variability over the Indian seas in pre and summer monsoon months during extreme monsoon seasons</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0365-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the possible linkage between summer monsoon rainfall over India and surface meteorological fields (basic fields and heat budget components) over monsoon region ($30^\circ E--120^\circ E, 30^\circ S--30^\circ N$) during the pre-monsoon month of May and summer monsoon season (June to September) are examined. For this purpose, monthly surface meteorological fields anomaly are analyzed for 42 years (1958--1999) using reanalysis data of NCEP/NCAR (National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research). The statistical significance of the anomaly (difference) between the surplus and deficient monsoon years in the surface meteorological fields are also examined by Student's t-test at 95% confidence level.</p>
					<p>Significant negative anomalies of mean sea level pressure are observed over India, Arabian Sea and Arabian Peninsular in the pre-monsoon month of May and monsoon season. Significant positive anomalies in the zonal and meridional wind (at 2m) in the month of May are observed in the west Arabian Sea off Somali coast and for monsoon season it is in the central Arabian Sea that extends up to Somalia. Significant positive anomalies of the surface temperature and air temperature (at 2m) in the month of May are observed over north India and adjoining Pakistan and Afghanistan region. During monsoon season this region is replaced by significant negative anomalies. In the month of May, significant positive anomalies of cloud amount are observed over Somali coast, north Bay of Bengal and adjoining West Bengal and Bangladesh. During monsoon season, cloud amount shows positive anomalies over NW India and north Arabian Sea.</p>
					<p>There is overall reduction in the incoming shortwave radiation flux during surplus monsoon years. A higher magnitude of latent heat flux is also found in surplus monsoon years for the month of May as well as the monsoon season. The significant positive anomaly of latent heat flux in May, observed over southwest Arabian Sea, may be considered as an advance indicator of the possible behavior of the subsequent monsoon season. The distribution of net heat flux is predominantly negative over eastern Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean. Anomaly between the two extreme monsoon years in post 1980 (i.e., 1988 and 1987) shows that shortwave flux, latent heat flux and net heat flux indicate reversal in sign, particularly in south Indian Ocean. Variations of the heat budget components over four smaller sectors of Indian seas, namely Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and west Indian Ocean and east Indian Ocean show that a small sector of Arabian Sea is most dominant during May and other sectors showing reversal in sign of latent heat flux during monsoon season.</p>

				<title>Isotopic and sedimentological clues to productivity change in Late Riphean Sea: A case study from two intracratonic basins of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0379-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Enriched $^{13}C/^{12}C$ ratios with $\delta ^{13} C \sim 3â°$ (w.r.t PDB) of two Late Riphean ($\sim 700--610Ma$) intracratonic carbonate successions viz., Bhander Limestone of Vindhyan Basin and Raipur Limestone of Chattisgarh Basin suggest higher organic productivity during this period. This view is supported by sedimentological evidence of higher biohermal growth and consequent increase in depositional relief in the low gradient ramp settings inferred for these basins. Oxygen isotope analysis of these carbonates show distinct segregation between enriched deeper water carbonate mudstone and depleted shallow water stromatolite facies that received fresh water influx. This shows that facies-specific analyses can be useful in understanding the depositional setting of these sediments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Spectacular exposures of granulite-migmatite occur in the Chilka Lake area of the Eastern Ghats belt. The garnetiferous granite gneiss of peraluminous granitic composition, often contains restitic metapelite inclusions and is demonstrably a product of biotite-dehydration melting in pelitic rocks. On the other hand, older layers and bands of charnockitic rocks frequently occur as dismembered patches within the peraluminous granite, thus imparting a measled appearance of the granite exposures.</p>
					<p>The partial melting and emplacement of the peraluminous granite represent the Grenvillian thermal event, as evidenced by Rb-Sr whole rock and Pb-Pb zircon dating. On the other hand, minor patches of charnockite represent migmatized relict, as evidenced by some older zircons, in addition to those of Grenvillian age.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The propagation of plane waves in an anisotropic elastic medium possessing monoclinic symmetry is discussed. The expressions for the phase velocity of \textit {qP} and \textit {qSV} waves propagating in the plane of elastic symmetry are obtained in terms of the direction cosines of the propagation vector. It is shown that, in general, \textit {qP} waves are not longitudinal and \textit {qSV} waves are not transverse. Pure longitudinal and pure transverse waves can propagate only in certain specific directions. Closed-form expressions for the reflection coefficients of \textit {qP} and \textit {qSV} waves incident at the free surface of a homogeneous monoclinic elastic half-space are obtained. These expressions are used for studying numerically the variation of the reflection coefficients with the angle of incidence. The present analysis corrects some fundamental errors appearing in recent papers on the subject.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0413-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The low frequency oscillation of latent heat flux over the tropical oceans has been studied. The NCEP reanalyzed fields of wind and humidity alongwith Reynolds SST are used to compute the instantaneous as well as monthly mean surface latent heat fluxes (LHF) for the year 1999. The procedure of LHF computation is based on bulk method. Spectral analysis shows that significant energy is contained in Madden Julian Oscillation band in the winds, SST, moisture and in  the latent heat flux. The global distribution of wind, humidity, SST and LHF oscillation on the time scale of 30-50 days are analyzed. Maximum amplitude of oscillation on this time scale in all the above mentioned parameters were found over the Indian Ocean. The fluctuation of surface wind speed and moisture controls the latent heat flux on this time scale. The fluctuation of SST on this time scale does not seem to be important over most of the oceans.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The atmospheric correction bands 7 and 8 (765nm and 865nm respectively) of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite IRS P4-OCM (Ocean Colour Monitor) can be used for deriving aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the oceans. A retrieval algorithm has been developed which computes the AOD using band 7 data by treating the ocean surface as a dark background after removing the Rayleigh path radiance in the sensor-detected radiances. This algorithm has been used to detect marine aerosol distributions at different coastal and offshore locations around India.</p>
					<p>A comparison between OCM derived AOD and the NOAA operational AOD shows a correlation $\sim 0.92$ while that between OCM derived AOD and the ground-based sun photometer measurements near the coast of Trivandrum shows a correlation of $\sim 0.90$.</p>

				<page>0437-0451</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A linear model of the response of a stratified atmosphere to isolated heat sources in spherical coordinates is used to study the maintenance of the mean position of the mid tropospheric ridge and its displacement. It is well known that the performance of the southwest Indian monsoon is related to the latitudinal position of the April 500 hPa ridge along $75^\circ E$. It was demonstrated that an anomalous cooling associated with the increased snow cover in Eurasia can result in moderate southward displacement of the mid-tropospheric ridge. The results of this study indicate that the vertically integrated cooling rate (strength of heat sink) has more effect on the southward displacement of the ridge when the sink is closer to the ridge.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0467-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laboratory studies of 30 samples from 158m long drill core of the Hole 1105A (ODP Leg 179) of the Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge have revealed magnetic properties of the gabbros, olivine gabbros, oxide gabbros and olivine oxide gabbros down the core. Comparison of modal proportions of the oxides, grain sizes and magnetization parameters of the rocks has confirmed that most coarse-grained oxide mineral bearing rocks record low Koenigsberger ratio (2 to 5) and median destructive fields (5 to 7 mT). Average natural remanent magnetization (\textit {J_{nrm}}) and stable remanent magnetization (\textit {J_{st}}) of the core samples are 5.8A/m and 1.9 A/m, respectively. Their mean stable magnetic inclination is $66^\circ \pm 4^\circ $, about $14^\circ $ steeper than the expected dipole inclination of the area similar to the one reported at Hole 735 B. The excess inclination perhaps marks a tectonic block rotation of the reversely magnetized rocks of the bank. We interpret that gabbros and serpentinites devoid of basaltic carapace significantly contribute to seafloor spreading anomalies of the bank.</p>

				<title>Late Quaternary sea level and environmental changes from relic carbonate deposits of the western margin of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relic carbonate deposits along the western margin of India occur as dolomite crusts, aragonite sands (pelletal / oolitic) and aragonite-cemented limestones, oyster shells, corals, encrusted coralline algal and foraminiferal-dominated nodules. The petrology and mineralogy of the deposits indicate that except for aragonite sands and foraminiferal nodules, the others were formed in shallow marine conditions and serve as sea level indicators. Radiocarbon dates were measured for 62 relic deposits covering the entire margin. The age of these deposits on the continental shelf off Cape Comorin and Mangalore, between 110 and 18m depth, ranges between 12, 610 $^{14}C$ yr BP and 6,390 $^{14}C$ yr BP. On the northwestern margin of India, especially on the carbonate platform (between 64 and 100 m), the age ranges from 17,250 to 6,730 $^{14}C$ yr BP. The relic deposits of the Gulf of Kachchh at depths between 35 and 25m are dated at 12,550--9,630 $^{14}C$ yr BP. The age vs. depth plot of the relic deposits further indicates that the Gulf of Kachchh was inundated much early, atleast by 15 ka, after the Last Glacial Maximum, and was subjected to uplift and subsidence during the Holocene. The carbonate platform subsided during the early Holocene. Some of the relic deposits between Cape Comorin and Mangalore plot on or, closely follow the glacio-eustatic sea level curve. Despite abundant siliciclastic flux discharged by the Narmada and Tapti during the early Holocene, the platform off these rivers is largely devoid of this flux and carbonate sedimentation continued until 6,700 $^{14}C$ yr BP. We suggest that the river-derived ediment flux diverted southwards under the influence of the SW monsoon current and, thereby, increased the turbidity on the shelf and slope southeast of the carbonate platform and facilitated the formation of deeper water foraminiferal nodules off Vengurla-Goa.</p>

				<title>Effects of galvanic distortions on magnetotelluric data: Interpretation and its correction using deep electrical data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The non-inductive galvanic disturbances due to surficial bodies, lying smaller than high frequency skin depth, cause serious interpretational errors in magnetotelluric data. These frequency independent distortions result in a quasi-static shift between the apparent resistivity curves known as static shift. Two-dimensional modelling studies, for the effects of surficial bodies on magnetotelluric interpretation, show that the transverse electric (TE) mode apparent resistivity curves are hardly affected compared to the transverse magnetic (TM) mode curves, facilitating the correction by using a curve shifting method to match low frequency asymptotes. But in the case of field data the problem is rather complicated because of the random distribution of geometry and conductivity of near surface inhomogeneities. Here we present the use of deep resistivity sounding (DRS) data to constrain MT static shift. Direct current sensitivity studies show that the behaviour of MT static shift can be estimated using DC resistivity measurements close to the MT sounding station to appreciable depths. The distorted data set is corrected using the MT response for DRS model and further subject to joint inversion with DRS data. Joint inversion leads to better estimation of MT parameters compared to the separate inversion of data sets.</p>

The estimated parameters are the location, lateral extent or width and depth to top surface of the prism. Forward modelling is attempted by 2D-Finite Difference method. The proposed stabilised analytic signal algorithm (RES2AS) uses Tikhonov's regularization scheme and FFT routines. The algorithm is tested on three theoretical examples and field data from the campus of Roorkee University. The stability of RES2AS is also tested on synthetic error prone secondary pole-pole potential data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Temporal variations have been observed in both dissolved helium and TDS in the form of increase in basaltic and decrease in alluvial aquifers. The increase in basaltic aquifers has been explained by enhanced pumping of old groundwater with relatively higher concentration of dissolved helium and salt, whereas the decrease in alluvial aquifers has been explained by dilution from the post monsoon groundwater recharge. Therefore, the observed temporal variations cannot be ascribed to the contemporary enhanced seismic activity in this region since August-September 2000.</p>

				<title>Indian Ocean surface winds from NCMRWF analysis as compared to QuikSCAT and moored buoy winds</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0061-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The quality of the surface wind analysis at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (NCMRWF), New Delhi over the tropical Indian Ocean and its improvement in 2001 are examined by comparing it with \textit {in situ} buoy measurements and satellite derived surface winds from NASA QuikSCAT satellite (QSCT) during 1999, 2000 and 2001. The NCMRWF surface winds su ered from easterly bias of $1.0--1.5 ms^{-1}$ in the equatorial Indian Ocean (IO) and northerly bias of $2.0--3.0 ms^{-1}$ in the south equatorial IO during 1999 and 2000 compared to QSCT winds. The amplitude of daily variability was also underestimated compared to that in QSCT. In particular, the amplitude of daily variability of NCMRWF winds in the eastern equatorial IO was only about 60% of that of QSCT during 1999 and 2000. The NCMRWF surface winds during 2001 have significantly improved with the bias of the mean analyzed winds considerably reduced everywhere bringing it to within $0.5 ms^{-1}$ of QSCT winds in the equatorial IO. The amplitude and phase of daily and intraseasonal variability are very close to that in QSCT almost everywhere during 2001. It is shown that the weakness in the surface wind analysis during 1999 and 2000 and its improvement in 2001 are related to the weakness in simulation of precipitation by the forecast model in the equatorial IO and its improvement in 2001. </p>

				<title>Impact of horizontal resolution on prediction of tropical cyclones over Bay of Bengal using a regional weather prediction model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0079-0093</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study is carried out to examine the performance of a regional atmospheric model in forecasting tropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal and its sensitivity to horizontal resolution. Two cyclones, which formed over the Bay of Bengal during the years 1995 and 1997, are simulated using a regional weather prediction model with two horizontal resolutions of 165km and 55 km. The model is found to perform reasonably well towards simulation of the storms. The structure, intensity and track of the cyclones are found to be better simulated by finer resolution of the model as compared to the coarse resolution. Rainfall amount and its distribution are also found to be sensitive to the model horizontal resolution. Other important fields, viz., vertical velocity, horizontal divergence and horizontal moisture flux are also found to be sensitive to model horizontal resolution and are better simulated by the model with finer horizontal grids.</p>

				<title>The Indian summer monsoon as revealed by NCMRWF system</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0095-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, we present the mean seasonal features of the Indian summer monsoon circulation in the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) global data assimilation and forecast system. The large-scale budgets of heat and moisture are examined in the analyzed and model atmosphere. The daily operational analyses and forecasts (day 1 through day 5) produced for the summer seasons comprising June, July and August of 1995 and 1993 have been considered for the purpose. The principal aim of the study is two-fold. Primarily, to comprehend the influence of the systematic errors over the Indian summer monsoon, secondarily, to analyze the performance of the model in capturing the interseasonal variability.</p>
					<p>The heat and moisture balances show reduction in the influx of heat and moisture in the model forecasts compared to the analyzed atmosphere over the monsoon domain. Consequently, the diabatic heating also indicates reducing trend with increase in the forecast period. In effect, the strength of Indian summer monsoon, which essentially depends on these parameters, weakens considerably in the model forecasts. Despite producing feeble monsoon circulation, the model captures interseasonal variability realistically. Although, 1995 and 1993 are fairly normal monsoon seasons, the former received more rainfall compared to the latter in certain pockets of the monsoon domain. This is clearly indicated by the analyzed and model atmosphere in terms of energetics.</p>

				<title>Laser microprobe for the study of noble gases and nitrogen in single grains: A case study of individual chondrules from the Dhajala meteorite</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0113-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A laser microprobe capable of analysing nitrogen and noble gases in individual grains with masses less than a milligram is described. It can be used in both continuous wave (CW) mode, useful for stepwise heating of an individual grain, as well as in pulsed mode, useful for ablating material from a small selected area of a sample, for gas extraction. We could achieve low blanks (in ccSTP units) for $^{4}He(4.8 \times 10^{-12}),^{22}Ne(1.0 \times 10^{-12}),^{36}Ar(1.0 \times 10^{-13}),^{84}Kr(2.9 \times 10^{-14}),^{132}Xe(2.6 \times 10^{-14})$, and N (87 pg), using this system. Preliminary data for individual chondrules from the Dhajala meteorite show that noble gases and nitrogen from grains as small as 170 microgram can be analysed using the present laser microprobe setup. The amount of trapped neon in Dhajala chondrules is very small, and nitrogen in the chondrules is isotopically heavier as compared to the bulk meteorite.</p>

				<title>Some salient features of the atmosphere observed over the north Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0131-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the near surface characteristics and vertical variations based on the observations made at $17.5^\circ N$ and $89^\circ E$ from ORV Sagar Kanya in the north Bay of Bengal during the Bay of Bengal Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX) carried out in July--August 1999. BOBMEX captured both the active and weak phases of convection. SST remained above the convection threshold  throughout the BOBMEX. While the response of the SST to atmospheric forcing was clearly observed, the response of the atmosphere to SST changes was not clear. SST decreased during periods of large scale precipitation, and increased during a weak phase of convection. It is shown that the latent heat flux at comparable wind speeds was about 25--50% lower over the Bay during BOBMEX compared to that over the Indian Ocean during other seasons and tropical west Pacific. On the other hand, the largest variations in the surface daily net heat flux are observed over the Bay during BOBMEX. SST predicted using observed surface fluxes showed that 1-D heat balance model works sometime but not always, and horizontal advection is important. The high resolution Vaisala radiosondes launched during BOBMEX could clearly bring out the changes in the vertical structure of the atmosphere between active and weak phases of convection. Convective Available Potential Energy of the surface air decreased by 2--3 kJ $kg^{â1}$ following convection, and recovered  in a time period of one or two days. The mid tropospheric relative humidity and water vapor content, and wind direction show the major changes between the active and weak phases of convection.</p>

				<title>A study on the structure of the convective atmosphere over the Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Convective activity is one of the major processes in the atmosphere influencing the local and large scale weather in the tropics. The latent heat released by the cumulus cloud is known to drive monsoon circulation, which on the other hand supplies the moisture that maintains the cumulus clouds. An investigation is carried out on the convective structure of the atmosphere during active and suppressed periods of convection using data sets obtained from the Bay of Bengal and Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX). The cumulus convection though being a small-scale phenomenon, still influences its embedding environment by interaction through various scales. This study shows the variation in the kinematic and convective parameters during the transition from suppressed to active periods of convection. Convergence in the lower levels and strong upward vertical velocity, significant during active convection are associated with the formation of monsoon depressions. The apparent heat source due to latent heat release and the vertical transport of the eddy heat by cumulus convection, and the apparent moisture sink due to net condensation and vertical divergence of the eddy transport of moisture, are estimated through residuals of the thermodynamic equation and examined in relation to monsoon activity during BOBMEX.</p>

				<title>Circulation characteristics of a monsoon depression during BOBMEX-99 using high-resolution analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0165-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The skill and efficiency of a numerical model mostly varies with the quality of initial values, accuracy on parameterization of physical processes and horizontal and vertical resolution of the model. Commonly used low-resolution reanalyses are hardly able to capture the prominent features associated with organized convective processes in a monsoon depression. The objective is to prepare improved high-resolution analysis by the use of MM5 modelling system developed by the Pennsyl- vania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR). It requires the objective comparison of high and low-resolution analysis datasets in assessing the specific convective features of a monsoon depression. For this purpose, reanalysis datasets of NCAR/NCEP (National Center for Atmospheric Research/National Centers for Environmental Prediction) at a horizontal resolution of $2.5^\circ $ (latitude/longitude) have been used as first guess in the objective analysis scheme. The additional asynoptic datasets obtained during BOBMEX-99 are utilized within the assimilation process. Cloud Motion Wind (CMW) data of METEOSAT satellite and SSM/I surface wind data are included for the improvement of derived analysis. The multiquadric (MQD) interpolation technique is selected and applied for meteorological objective analysis at a horizontal resolution of 30 km. After a successful inclusion of additional data, the resulting reanalysis is able to produce the structure of convective organization as well as prominent synoptic features associated with monsoon depression. Comparison and error verifications have been done with the help of available upper-air station data. The objective verification reveals the efficiency of the analysis scheme.</p>

				<title>Simulation of Marine Boundary Layer characteristics using a 1-D PBL model over the Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0185-0204</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The characteristic features of the marine boundary layer (MBL) over the Bay of Bengal during the southwest monsoon and the factors influencing it are investigated. The Bay of Bengal and Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX) carried out during July--August 1999 is the first observational experiment under the Indian Climate Research Programme (ICRP). A very high-resolution data in the vertical was obtained during this experiment, which was used to study the MBL characteristics off the east coast of India in the north and south Bay of Bengal. Spells of active and suppressed convection over the Bay were observed, of which, three representative convective episodes were considered for the study. For this purpose a one-dimensional multi-level PBL model with a TKE$-\varepsilon $ closure scheme was used. The soundings, viz., the vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, zonal and meridional component of wind, obtained onboard ORV Sagar Kanya and from coastal stations along the east coast are used for the study. The temporal evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, marine boundary layer height (MBLH), sensible and latent heat fluxes and drag coefficient of momentum are simulated for different epochs of monsoon and monsoon depressions during BOBMEX-99.The model also generates the vertical profiles of potential temperature, specific humidity, zonal and meridional wind. These simulated values compared reasonably well with the observations available from BOBMEX.</p>

				<title>Study of total column atmospheric aerosol optical depth, ozone and precipitable water content over Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0205-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The spatial and temporal variations in aerosols and precursor gases over oceanic regions have special importance in the estimation of radiative forcing parameters and thereby in the refinement of general circulation models. Extensive observations of the columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD), total column ozone (TCO) and precipitable water content (PWC) have been carried out using the on-line, multi-band solar radiometers onboard ORV Sagar Kanya (Cruise # SK 147B) over Bay of Bengal during 11th--28th August 1999. Aerosol optical and physical properties (optical depth and angstrom parameter) have been estimated at six wavelengths covering from UV to NIR (380--1020 nm) while TCO and PWC have been determined using the UV band around 300nm and NIR band around 940 nm, respectively. Added, concurrent meteorological and satellite observations during this field phase of BOBMEX-99 have been utilized to investigate spectral-temporal variations of AOD, TCO and PWC in marine environment.</p>
					<p>The results indicate lower AODs (around 0.4 at characteristic wavelength of 500 nm) and size distributions with abundance of coarse-mode particles as compared to those aerosols of typical land origin. An interesting result that is found in the present study is the significant reduction in AOD at all wavelengths from initial to later part of observation period due to cloud-scavenging and rain-washout effects as well as signature of coastal aerosol loading. The clear-sky daytime diurnal variation of TCO shows gradual increase during post-sunrise hours, broad maximum during afternoon hours and gradual decrease during pre-sunset hours, which is considered to be due to photochemical reactions. The diurnal variation curve of PWC showed maximum ($\sim 4cm$) during morning hours and gradual decrease ($\sim 3.5cm$) towards evening hours, which are found to be greater as compared to typical values over land. Another interesting feature observed is that although the PWC values are very high, there was no proportionate or appreciable enhancement in AOD--a feature that can be utilized to infer composition of aerosols over the study region.</p>

					<p>A daily rainfall dataset and the corresponding rainfall maps have been produced by objective analysis of rainfall data. The satellite estimate of rainfall and the raingauge values are merged to form the final analysis. Associated with epochs of monsoon these rainfall maps are able to show the rainfall activities over India and the Bay of Bengal region during the BOBMEX period. The intra-seasonal variations of rainfall during BOBMEX are also seen using these data. This dataset over the oceanic region compares well with other available popular datasets like GPCP and CMAP. Over land this dataset brings out the features of monsoon in more detail due to the availability of more local raingauge stations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We document the flow features, which are associated with the important synoptic systems that affected the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and its neighbourhood and controlled the convective activity there during BOBMEX. The monsoon during July and August, 1999 was subdued. It was slightly more active in the initial phase of BOBMEX that commenced on 15th July 1999 and continued up to first week of August 1999 but weakened during the second half of August. The convection was accordingly affected, reducing the rainfall over India. There were several active and weak spells of convection over the Bay of Bengal that manifested in five low pressure systems, of which twobecame depressions.</p>

				<title>Observations of wind and waves in the central Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99 and their effect on mixed layer depth variability due to forced mixing</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0255-0266</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-series wind and wave measurements were carried out onboard INS Sagardhwani in the central Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99. Various other marine meteorological and oceanographic measurements relevant to monsoon studies were also collected simultaneously. The observed variations of wind and waves and the associated mixed layer depth (MLD) variability based on both temperature and density criteria at 3 hourly intervals are presented in this paper as a case study. At the time-series location ($13^\circ N, 87^\circ E$) wind varied between 6 and 16 m/s and the predominant direction was southwesterly. The significant wave height and period varied from 1.9 to 3.7m and 8 to 13 s respectively. Some of the available statistical predictive methods for the determination of MLD by forced mixing are utilized to test the extent of mechanical mixing within the top layer of water by the local wind and wave activity. The same is extended to formulate a new empirical relation for gross estimation of effective depth within which the sound energy is generally trapped during its transmission in the surface duct. The present analysis aiming for estimation of observed MLD variability (35 to 75 m) using the suggested simple empirical relation reveals that, the mixed layer variability observed during the experiment depends on both local ocean variability as well as remote forcing as reported earlier.</p>

				<title>An experimental study of radiative fluxes in the south Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX 1999</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0267-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time series measurements of radiative fluxes were made onboard INS Sagardhwani (SD) in the south Bay of Bengal near DS3 ($13^\circ N$ and $87^\circ E$) during the BOBMEX field experiment. An inter- comparison experiment conducted at DS3 showed that the radiative fluxes measured by Kipp and Zonen, Albedo meter and net Pyrgeometer onboard SD and by Eppley radiometers onboard ORV Sagar Kanya (SK) are well matched. It may be mentioned that the measurements showed consistency and good agreement between SD and SK ships, even though no Gimbal mounting was used for radiation instruments onboard SD.</p>
					<p>The main aim of the experiment was collection of high quality radiation data during the monsoon period, which can give an insight into the nature of the ocean-atmosphere coupling. The data on the four radiative fluxes collected on SD are averaged at 5 minute intervals and then hourly and daily averages have been computed. The hourly shortwave albedo and the atmospheric transmission factor are also computed and the variation of albedo in relation to the solar altitude and the transmissivity factor (TF) are studied. The mean albedo over the south Bay of Bengal under clear, partly cloudy and overcast skies are found to be 0.05, 0.07 and 0.2 respectively.</p>

				<page>0283-0293</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface meteorological parameters acquired during the field phase experiment, BOBMEX-99, for the stationary periods (SP I and II) of the ship ORV Sagar Kanya over Bay of Bengal have been analysed. Active and weak monsoon conditions were observed during the first and the second phase of the experiment respectively over India as well as over the stationary ship location. The phase mean sea surface temperature (SST) is found to be the same in both the phases, however large differences have been observed in the phase mean values of wind speed, mean sea level pressure, latent heat and momentum fluxes at air-sea interface. Synoptic scale monsoon disturbances formed only during the period of strong north-south pressure gradient over the Bay region. Events of prominent fall in SST and in the upper 15m ocean layer mean temperature and salinity values during typical rainfall events are cited. The impact of monsoon disturbances on ocean-atmosphere interface transfer processes has been investigated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thermodynamic structure of the marine atmosphere in the region between 80 and $87^\circ E$ along $13^\circ N$ over the Bay of Bengal was studied using 13 high resolution radiosonde profiles from surface â400 hPa collected onboard ORV Sagar Kanya during the period 27th--30th August, during BOBMEX-99. Saturation point concept, mixing line analysis and conserved variable diagrams have been used to identify boundary layer characteristics such as air mass movement and stability of the atmosphere. The results showed relatively dry air near the ocean surface between 1000 and 950 hPa. This feature is confirmed by the conserved $\theta _v$ structure in this layer. Further, $\theta_v$ seldom showed any inversions in this region. The $\theta _e$ and $\theta _es$ profiles showed persistent low cloud layers between 900 and 700 hPa. The conserved variable diagrams ($\theta _{e â q}$) showed the existence of double mixing line structures approximately at 950 and 700 hPa levels.</p>

				<title>Flexure of the Indian plate and intraplate earthquakes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0315-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The flexural bulge in central India resulting from India's collision with Tibet has a wavelength of approximately 670 km. It is manifest topographically and in the free-air gravity anomaly and the geoid. Calculations of the stress distribution within a flexed Indian plate reveal spatial variations throughout the depth of the plate and also a function of distance from the Himalaya. The wave- length (and therefore local gradient) of stress variation is a function of the effective elastic thickness of the plate, estimates of which have been proposed to lie in the range 40--120 km. The imposition of this stress field on the northward moving Indian plate appears fundamental to explaining the current distribution of intraplate earthquakes and their mechanisms. The current study highlights an outer trough south of the flexural bulge in central India where surface stresses are double the contiguous compressional stresses to the north and south. The Bhuj, Latur and Koyna earthquakes and numerous other recent reverse faulting events occurred in this compressional setting. The N/S spatial gradient of stress exceeds 2 bars/km near the flexural bulge. The overall flexural stress distribution provides a physical basis for earthquake hazard mapping and suggests that areas of central India where no historic earthquakes are recorded may yet be the locus of future damaging events.</p>

				<title>Pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic displacements associated with the Bhuj 2001 earthquake derived from recent and historic geodetic data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0331-0345</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 26th January 2001 Bhuj earthquake occurred in the Kachchh Rift Basin which has a long history of major earthquakes. Great Triangulation Survey points (GTS) were first installed in the area in 1856--60 and some of these were measured using Global Positioning System (GPS) in the months of February and July 2001. Despite uncertainties associated with repairs and possible reconstruction of points in the past century, the re-measurements reveal pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic deformation related to Bhuj earthquake. More than 25 $\mu -strain$ contraction north of the epicenter appears to have occurred in the past 140 years corresponding to a linear convergence rate of approximately 10 mm/yr across the Rann of Kachchh. Motion of a single point at Jamnagar 150km south of the epicenter in the 4 years prior to the earthquake, and GTS-GPS displacements in Kathiawar suggests that pre-seismic strain south of the epicenter was small and differs insignificantly from  that measured elsewhere in India. Of the 20 points measured within 150km of the epicenter, 12 were made at existing GTS points which revealed epicentral displacements of up to 1m, and strain changes exceeding 30 $\mu -strain$. Observed displacements are consistent with reverse co-seismic slip. Re-measurements in July 2001 of one GTS point (Hathria) and eight new points established in February reveal post-seismic deformation consistent with continued slip on the Bhuj rupture zone.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The occurrence of a severe earthquake is a rare event with its effect localized in a limited region. There are no prior indications of its occurrence too; hence experiencing such an event is just a matter of chance, which the author had by virtue of his posting at Bhuj. This paper presents a detailed account of observations made in the wake of the Bhuj earthquake of January 26th 2001, describing physical and mental reactions during the earthquake, the post-quake scenario, the nature and cause of damage to buildings, the trend of aftershocks, various deformities, including ruptures and fissures on the surface of the earth, etc. which may be useful for a detailed study of the seismological activity in the region.</p>

				<title>A media-based assessment of damage and ground motions from the January 26th, 2001 M7.6 Bhuj, India earthquake</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0353-0373</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We compiled available news and internet accounts of damage and other effects from the 26th January, 2001, Bhuj earthquake, and interpreted them to obtain modified Mercalli intensities at over 200 locations throughout the Indian subcontinent. These values are used to map the intensity distribution using a simple mathematical interpolation method. The maps reveal several interesting features. Within the Kachchh region, the most heavily damaged villages are concentrated towards the western edge of the inferred fault, consistent with western directivity. Significant sediment- induced amplification is also suggested at a number of locations around the Gulf of Kachchh to the south of the epicenter. Away from the Kachchh region intensities were clearly amplified significantly in areas that are along rivers, within deltas, or on coastal alluvium such as mud flats and salt pans. In addition we use fault rupture parameters inferred from teleseismic data to predict shaking intensity at distances of 0--1000 km. We then convert the predicted hard rock ground motion parameters to MMI using a relationship (derived from internet-based intensity surveys) that assigns MMI based on the average effects in a region. The predicted MMIs are typically lower by 1--2 units than those estimated from news accounts. This discrepancy is generally consistent with the expected effect of sediment response, but it could also reflect other factors such as a tendency for media accounts to focus on the most dramatic damage, rather than the average effects. Our modeling results also suggest, however, that the Bhuj earthquake generated more high-frequency shaking than is expected for earthquakes of similar magnitude in California, and may therefore have been especially damaging.</p>

					<p>Damage observed during the Kutch earthquake of 26th January 2001 is classified according to the type of structure. This damage pattern has been used to draw the isoseismal map on the basis of the intensity scale given in IS 1893--2002 which covers only traditional one to two storey houses. Having thus estimated intensities, and observed damage to other types of structures, a new criterion was adopted which is included in this paper.

				<title>Aftershocks of 26th January 2001 Bhuj earthquake and seismotectonics of the Kutch region</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0385-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 26th January 2001 Bhuj earthquake was followed by intense aftershock activity. Aftershock data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) utilized in this study encompasses three months period from 26th January to 26th April 2001. Epicenters of the aftershock are plotted on a map depicting active faults. All the aftershocks of magnitude &mt; 5 and 70% of those ranging between magnitude 3 and 5 are confined to an area resembling a horseshoe pattern with a pointed end towards NE. The other 20% of magnitude 3 to 5 are enclosed within an almost parallel boundary. Only 10% are found to be beyond this limiting boundary. 50% of the recorded aftershocks took place within the first week of the main event and this study reveals that the basic characteristic pattern of aftershock activity can be determined on the basis of the data of only one week.</p>
					<p>Four major NW-SE trending active faults are mapped in the Kutch region. They define the western limit of Cambay structure and also mark the western limit of Dharangadhra and Wadhwan basins along the SE continuation in Saurashtra. These faults separate the Kutch region into two geologically different blocks. On the SW side the mapped horseshoe pattern gets characteristically truncated along the western most fault, which is characterized by a strike-slip movement in the south and vertical movement in the north. The present study has revealed that the epicenter of the 26th January earthquake is located in the vicinity of the Bhachau township, close to the intersection with the Kutch mainland fault. Furthermore, it has been noticed that most of the epicenters of the aftershock are confined in the intersectional area of the Kutch mainland fault and the NW-SE faults.</p>

				<title>Aftershock activity of Bhuj earthquake of January 26th, 2001</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0391-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Following a large-sized Bhuj earthquake ($ \textit {M_s} = 7.6$) of January 26th, 2001, a small aperture 4- station temporary local network was deployed, in the epicentral area, for a period of about three weeks and resulted in the recording of more than 1800 aftershocks ($-0.07 \leq \textit {M_L} &lt; 5.0$). Preliminary locations of epicenters of 297 aftershocks ($2.0 \leq \textit {M_L} &lt; 5.0$) have brought out a dense cluster of aftershock activity, the center of which falls 20km NW of Bhachau. Epicentral locations of after-shocks encompass a surface area of about $50 \times 40km^2$ that seems to indicate the surface projection of the rupture area associated with the earthquake. The distribution of aftershock activity above magnitude 3, shows that aftershocks are nonuniformly distributed and are aligned in the north, northwest and northeast directions. The epicenter of the mainshock falls on the southern edge of the delineated zone of aftershock activity and the maximum clustering of activity occurs in close proximity of the mainshock. Well-constrained focal depths of 122 aftershocks show that 89% of the aftershocks occurred at depths ranging between 6 and 25km and only 7% and 4% aftershocks occur at depths less than 5 and more than 25km respectively. The Gutenberg-Richter (GR) relationship, log $ \textit {N} = 4.52--0.89 \textit {M_L}$, is fitted to the aftershock data ($1.0 \leq \textit {M_L} &lt; 5.0$) and the \textit {b}-value of 0.89 has been estimated for the aftershock activity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An intraplate earthquake of magnitude (\textit {M_c}) 6.9 (Anon 2001a) struck Bhuj and the adjoining region of Kachchh in Gujarat on January 26th, 2001 at about 0316 hrs (GMT) and was followed by a number of aftershocks. The epicentre of this earthquake was located at $23.4^\circ N$ and $70.28^\circ E$ close to the Kachchh mainland fault. The intensity observed around the epicenter was X on the MSK scale.</p>
					<p>A study of 531 aftershocks, in the magnitude range of 3.0--5.7, recorded at Vadodara Seismological Observatory till March 31st, 2001 has been carried out and various statistical parameters calculated. The total energy released during the study period is calculated to be $8.2 \times 10^{14}$ joule. Sudden occurrence of the main shock without any foreshock in the same tectonic system is a unique feature of this sequence. The \textit {b}-value (0.86), value of \textit {M_0--M_1} (1.2), high \textit {M_1/M_0} (0.89) and high value of the decay constant \textit {h} (0.91), all support the tectonic origin of the present study.</p>

				<title>Study of the epicentral trends and depth sections for aftershocks of the 26th January 2001, Bhuj earthquake in western India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0401-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Geological Survey of India (GSI) established a twelve-station temporary microearthquake (MEQ) network to monitor the aftershocks in the epicenter area of the Bhuj earthquake ($\textit {M_w}7.5$) of 26th January 2001. The main shock occurred in the Kutch rift basin with the epicenter to the north of Bhachao village, at an estimated depth of 25km (IMD). About 3000 aftershocks ($\textit {M_d} \geq 1.0$), were recorded by the GSI network over a monitoring period of about two and half months from 29th  January 2001 to 15th April 2001. About 800 aftershocks ($\textit {M_d} \geq 2.0$) are located in this study. The epicenters are clustered in an area $60km \times 30km$, between $23.3^\circ N$ and $23.6^\circ N$ and $70^\circ E$ and $70.6^\circ E$. The main shock epicenter is also located within this zone.</p>
					<p>Two major aftershock trends are observed; one in the NE direction and other in the NW direction. Out of these two trends, the NE trend was more pronounced with depth. The major NE-SW trend is parallel to the Anjar-Rapar lineament. The other trend along NW-SE is parallel to the Bhachao lineament. The aftershocks at a shallower depth (&lt; 10 km) are aligned only along the NW-SE direction. The depth slice at 10km to 20km shows both the NE-SW trend and the NW-SE trend. At greater depth (20 km{38 km) the NE-SW trend becomes more predominant. This observation suggests that the major rupture of the main shock took place at a depth level more than 20 km; it propagated along the NE-SW direction, and a conjugate rupture followed the NW-SE direction.</p>
					<p>A N-S depth section of the aftershocks shows that some aftershocks are clustered at shallower depth $\leq 10km$, but intense activity is observed at 15--38km depth. There is almost an aseismic layer at 10--15km depth. The activity is sparse below 38 km. The estimated depth of the main shock at 25km is consistent with the cluster of maximum number of the aftershocks at 20--38 km. A NW-SE depth section of the aftershocks, perpendicular to the major NE-SW trend, indicates a SE dipping plane and a NE-SW depth section across the NW-SE trend shows a SW dipping plane.</p>
					<p>The epicentral map of the stronger aftershocks $\textit {M} \geq 4.0$ shows a prominent NE trend. Stronger aftershocks have followed the major rupture trend of the main shock. The depth section of these stronger aftershocks reveals that it occurred in the depth range of 20 to 38 km, and corroborates with a south dipping seismogenic plane.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A 12-station temporary microearthquake network was established by the Geological Survey of India for aftershock monitoring of the January 26th, 2001 Bhuj earthquake (\textit {M_W} 7.6) in the Kutch district of Gujarat state, western India. The epicentres of the aftershocks show two major trends: one in the NE direction and the other in the NW direction. Fault-plane solutions of the best- located and selected cluster of events that occurred along the NE trend, at a depth of 15--38 km, show reverse faulting with a large left-lateral strike-slip motion, which are comparable with the main-shock solution. The NW trending upper crustal aftershocks at depth &lt; 10 km, on the other hand, show reverse faulting with right-lateral strike-slip motion, and the mid crustal and lower crustal aftershocks, at a depth of 15--38 km, show pure reverse faulting as well as reverse faulting with right-lateral and left-lateral strike-slip motions; these solutions are not comparable with the main-shock solution. It is inferred that the intersection of two faults has been the source area for stress concentration to generate the main shock and the aftershocks.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0421-0429</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The current designs of supporting structures of elevated water tanks are extremely vulnerable under lateral forces due to an earthquake and the Bhuj earthquake provided another illustration when a great many water tank stagings suffered damage and a few collapsed. The more popular shaft type stagings suffer from poor ductility of thin shell sections besides low redundancy and toughness whereas framed stagings consist of weak members and poor brace-column joints. A strength analysis of a few damaged shaft type stagings clearly shows that all of them either met or exceeded the strength requirements of IS:1893--1984, however, they were all found deficient when compared with requirements of the International Building Code. IS:1893--1984 is unjustifiably low for these systems which do not have the advantage of ductility and redundancy and are currently being underestimated at least by a factor of 3 and need an upward revision of forces immediately.</p>

				<title>Behaviour of masonry structures during the Bhuj earthquake of January 2001</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0431-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A variety of masonry structures suffered damage during the recent Bhuj earthquake. Some of the traditional masonry structures had no earthquake resistant features and suffered considerable damage. This paper attempts to evaluate the behaviour of masonry structures based on the type of masonry used in places like Bhuj, Anjar, Bhachau, Morbi, Samakhyali and several other places. Quite a few masonry buildings had used earthquake resistant features like lintel bands and corner reinforcements. The cracking and failure patterns of such buildings have also been examined. The paper concludes with a discussion on the relevance of the current codal provisions for earthquake resistance of masonry structures and the direction of further research in the area.</p>

				<title>Estimation of S-wave site response in and around Delhi region from weak motion data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0441-0462</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Site response in and around Delhi is studied using digital seismograms recorded by a thirteen-station VSAT-based 24-bit digital Delhi telemetry network of the India Meteorological Department. Nine local ($\textit {M_l} \geq 2.3$) and nine regional ($\textit {M_l \geq 3.9$) earthquakes are selected for the estimation of site amplification factor using the classical standard spectral ratio for regional events (Ridge Delhi Observatory being the reference station), normalized standard spectral ratio for local events, horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio or receiver function and the generalized inversion techniques in the frequency range of 0.5 to 7.5 Hz. Site response curves at all the thirteen stations exhibit station to station variation of the site amplification factor reflecting the changes in geologic/geotectonic/soil conditions. A comparison of the site response values obtained by the generalized inversion with those computed using receiver function technique shows a large scatter even though the pattern of the curves remain more or less similar. However, the site effects computed by generalized inversion and standard spectral ratio exhibit a good 1:1 correspondence. The peaks yielded by all the methods have been observed to occur at the same frequencies. It is evident that the softer fluvial deposits of the newer alluvium of the east Yamuna sector show steeper site amplification gradient at lower frequencies, while the greater Delhi experiences moderate site amplification. The variation of site response corroborates the abrupt changes in intensity from one location to another due to local site condition.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of basin-edge and soil velocity on the ground motion characteristics have been simulated using 2.5D modeling. One of the most significant advantages of the 2.5D simulation is that 3D radiation pattern can be generated in a 2D numerical grid using double-couple shear dislocation source. Further, 2.5D numerical modeling avoids the extensive computational cost of 3D modeling. The responses of basin-edge model using different soil velocities revealed that surface waves were generated near the edge of the basin and propagated normal to the edge, towards the basin. Further, the results depict increase of amplification, duration and surface wave generation with the decrease in soil velocity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Bhuj earthquake of January 26th, 2001, induced wide spread liquefaction within the Kachch peninsula. It has been pointed out that inundation due to soil liquefaction was short lived in some parts than in others in the affected region. Several geological, seismological and hydrological factors would have cumulatively contributed to these observed changes.</p>
					<p>We simulate in this article, undrained or short-term change in pore pressure in a poroelastic half space, in response to a simplified model of the Bhuj earthquake source. We find that the regions of relatively shorter lived inundation due to soil liquefaction may fall in the region where pore pressure responsible for soil liquefaction attributable to strong ground shaking was counteracted by pore pressure changes due to undrained poroelastic effect and vice versa.</p>

				<title>Determination of rare earth and refractory trace element abundances in early solar system objects by ion microprobe</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0485-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Experimental and analytical procedures devised for measurement of rare earth element (REE)  abundances using a secondary ion mass spectrometer (ion microprobe) are described. This approach is more versatile than the conventional techniques such as neutron activation analysis and isotope dilution mass spectrometry by virtue of its high spatial resolution that allows determination of REE abundances in small domains (10--20 micron) within individual mineral phases. The ion microprobe measurements are performed at a low mass-resolving power adopting the energy-filltering technique (Zinner and Crozaz 1986) for removal and suppression of unresolved complex molecular interferences in the REE masses of interest. Synthetic standards are used for determining various instrument specific parameters needed in the data deconvolution procedure adopted for obtaining  REE abundances. Results obtained from analysis of standards show that our ion microprobe may be used for determining REE abundances down to ppm range with uncertainties of $\sim 10$ to 15%. Abundances of rare earth and several other refractory trace elements in a set of early solar system objects isolated from two primitive carbonaceous chondrites were determined using the procedures devised by us. The results suggest that some of these objects could be high temperature nebular condensates, while others are products of melting and recrystallization of precursor nebular solids in a high temperature environment.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>At the India Meteorological Department (IMD), New Delhi, a 12-level limited area model with 100km horizontal resolution has been in use for weather forecasting. The present study uses this model together with a higher horizontal resolution (50 km) and vertical resolution (16-levels) model to examine the impact of increased resolution to simulate mesoscale features of rainfall during monsoon disturbances. The model was run for 22 days in the month of August 1997 and one week in September 1997 during three monsoon depressions and one cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal. The model results are compared with observations. The study shows that the model can capture mesoscale convective organization associated with monsoon depression.</p>

				<title>Indian monsoon variability in relation to Regional Pressure Index</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0521-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper Regional Pressure Index (RPI) over the Indian region ($20^\circ N--40^\circ N$ and $70^\circ E--85^\circ E$) has been constructed for 101 years (1899--1999) on a monthly scale. The relationship of these indices was carried out with the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (June--September) (ISMR) over the various homogeneous regions, for all the time scales. From the analysis it has been seen that RPI in the month of May is significantly associated with ISMR over various regions on all the scales. The relationship is statistically significant at 1% level. The study reveals that RPI in the month of May and January will be a new precursor for the long range forecasting of ISMR on the smaller spatial scale. On the decadal and climatological scale, winter and spring time RPI show a significant inverse relationship with the rainfall over the regions Peninsular India (PI) and North West India (NWI), while the association is direct with Central North East India (CNEI) and North East India (NEI). The relationship is significant at 0.1 and 1% level respectively.</p>

				<title>On breaks of the Indian monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0529-0558</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For over a century, the term break has been used for spells in which the rainfall over the Indian monsoon zone is interrupted. The phenomenon of `break monsoon' is of great interest because long intense breaks are often associated with poor monsoon seasons. Such breaks have distinct circulation characteristics (heat trough type circulation) and have a large impact on rainfed agriculture.Although interruption of the monsoon rainfall is considered to be the most important feature of the break monsoon, traditionally breaks have been identified on the basis of the surface pressure and wind patterns over the Indian region. We have defined breaks (and active spells) on the basis of rainfall over the monsoon zone. The rainfall criteria are chosen so as to ensure a large overlap with the traditional breaks documented by Ramamurthy (1969) and De \textit {et al} (1998). We have identified these rainbreaks for 1901--89. We have also identified active spells on the basis of rainfall over the Indian monsoon zone. We have shown that the all-India summer monsoon rainfall is significantly negatively correlated with the number of rainbreak days (correlation coefficient â0.56) and significantly positively correlated with the number of active days (correlation coefficient 0.47).Thus the interannual variation of the all-India summer monsoon rainfall is shown to be related to the number of days of rainbreaks and active spells identified here.</p>
					<p>There have been several studies of breaks (and also active spells in several cases) identified on the basis of different criteria over regions differing in spatial scales (e.g., Webster \textit {et al} 1998; Krishnan \textit {et al} 2000; Goswami and Mohan 2000; and Annamalai and Slingo 2001). We find that there is considerable overlap between the rainbreaks we have identified and breaks based on the traditional definition. There is some overlap with the breaks identified by Krishnan \textit {et al} (2000) but little overlap with breaks identified by Webster \textit {et al} (1998). Further, there are three or four active-break cycles in a season according to Webster \textit {et al} (1998) which implies a time scale of about 40 days for which Goswami and Mohan (2000), and Annamalai and Slingo (2001) have studied breaks and active minus break fluctuations. On the other hand, neither the traditional breaks (Ramamurthy 1969; and De \textit {et al} 1998) nor the rainbreaks occur every year. This suggests that the `breaks' in these studies are weak spells of the intraseasonal variation of the monsoon, which occur every year.</p>
					<p>We have derived the OLR and circulation patterns associated with rainbreaks and active spells and compared them with the patterns associated with breaks/active minus break spells from these studies. Inspite of differences in the patterns over the Indian region, there is one feature which is seen in the OLR anomaly patterns of breaks identified on the basis of different criteria as well as the rainbreaks identified in this paper viz., a quadrapole over the Asia-west Pacific region arising from anomalies opposite (same) in sign to those over the Indian region occurring over the equatorial Indian Ocean and northern tropical (equatorial) parts of the west Pacific. Thus it appears that this quadrapole is a basic feature of weak spells of the intraseasonal variation over the Asia-west Pacific region. Since the rainbreaks are intense weak spells, this basic feature is also seen in the composite patterns of these breaks. We find that rainbreaks (active spells) are also associated with negative (positive) anomalies over a part of the east Pacific suggesting that the convection over the Indian region is linked to that over the east Pacific not only on the interannual scale (as evinced by the link between the Indian summer monsoon rainfall and ENSO) but on the intraseasonal scale as well. </p>

				<title>Ion acoustic instability of HPT particles, FAC density, anomalous resistivity and parallel electric field in the auroral region</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0559-0567</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the magnetic storm of 21st March 1990, the DE-1 spacecraft encountered the auroral region at high invariant latitude at altitudes ranging from a few thousand kilometers in the ionosphere to many earth radii in the magnetosphere. The magnetic field perturbations interpretable as field aligned current (FAC) layers and the electrostatic turbulence possibly due to electrostatic ion acoustic instability driven by these currents are shown. The critical drift velocity of Hot Plasma Torus (HPT) electrons and the growth rate of ion acoustic wave as a function of electron to ion temperature ratio (\textit {T_e/T_i}) for low and high current densities and energy of HPT electrons are found out. The intense FAC destabilizes the ion acoustic wave and the resultant electrostatic turbulence creates an anomalous resistivity. The current driven resistivity produces parallel electric field and high power dissipation. The anomalous resistivity $\eta $, potential differnece along the auroral field lines Vjj, intensity of electric field turbulence Ejj and power produced per unit volume P are computed. It is found that the change in westward magnetic perturbation increases Jjj; ; Vjj;Ejj and P. Hence HPT electrons are heated and accelerated due to power dissipation during magnetically active periods in the auroral region. Concerning, applications, such HPT electrons can be used in particle accelerators like electron ring accelerator, smokatron etc.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coda \textit {Q(Q_c)} estimates for the Kumaun Himalaya region have been obtained in high frequency range. Local earthquakes, recorded by a digital seismic network in the region, which fall in the epicentral distances range of 10 to 80km and with a local magnitude range of 1.4 to 2.8, have been used. The coda waves of 30 sec window length, filtered at seven frequency bands centered at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 Hz, have been analysed using the single backscattering model. The values of \textit {Q_c} estimates vary from 65 to 283 at 1.5 Hz to 2119 to 3279 at 24.0 Hz which showed that \textit {Q_c} is frequency dependent and its value increases as frequency increases.</p>
					<p>A frequency-dependent \textit {Q_c} relationship, \textit {Q_c} = $(92 \pm 4.73)f^{(1.07 \pm .023)}$, is obtained for the region  representing the average attenuation characteristics of seismic waves for Kumaun Himalaya region.</p>

				<title>Structural appraisal of the Gadag schist belt from gravity investigations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0577-0586</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Semi-detailed gravity investigations were carried out over an area of approximately 2750 sq km with maximum N-S and E-W extents of 55 and 50km respectively in the Gadag region in the Dharwar craton with a view to obtain a clearer perception of the structural configuration of the region.</p>
					<p>From qualitative analysis of the gravity data, several tectonic features are inferred: the high density Gadag schist belt is characterized by a gravity high and occurs in two discontinuous segments --the main N-S trending segment, and its thinner NW-SE trending extension, the two separated by a NE-SW trending deep seated fault. While the N-S trend of the Gadag schist belt is bounded on its east by the NW-SE trending Chitradurga thrust fault and on its west by another major NNW-SSE trending fault, the NW-SE extension is likewise bounded by two other NW-SE major faults.</p>
					<p>Quantitative evaluation from forward modeling/inversion of five profiles in the region, assuming a density contrast of 0.29 gm/cc of the anomalous schistose body with the gneissic host rocks indicated a synclinal structure plunging to the southeast along its axis for the Gadag schist belt. The maximum width and depth from surface of the schist belt are 22km and 5.6km respectively.</p>

Airy stress function is used to derive the expressions of stresses and displacements which depend on the dip angle and depth of the upper edge of the fault. The effect of dip angle and depth of the upper edge of the fault on stresses and displacements is studied numerically and the results obtained are presented graphically.

				<title>Physical properties of aerosols at Maitri, Antarctica</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements of the submicron aerosol size distribution made at the Indian Antarctic station, Maitri ($70^\circ 45\prime S, 11^\circ 44\prime E$) from January 10th to February 24th, 1997, are reported. Total aerosol concentrations normally range from 800 to 1200 particles $cm^{â3}$ which are typical values for the coastal stations at Antarctica in summer. Aerosol size distributions are generally trimodal and open- ended with a peak between 75 and 133nm and two minima at 42 and 420 nm. Size distributions remain almost similar for several hours or even days in absence of any meteorological disturbance. Total aerosol concentration increases by approximately an order of magnitude whenever a low pressure system passes over the station. Based on the evolution of aerosol size-distributions during such aerosol enhancement periods, three types of cases have been identified. The nucleation mode in all three cases has been suggested to result from the photochemical conversion of the DMS emissions transported either by the marine air or by the air from the ice-melt regions around Maitri. Subsidence of midtropospheric air during the weakening of radiative inversion is suggested as a possible source of the nucleation mode particles in the third case. Growth of the nucleation mode particles by condensation, coagulation and/or by cloud processes has been suggested to be responsible for other modes in size distributions.</p>

				<title>Isotopic evidence of Middle Proterozoic magmatism from Bombay High Field: Implications to crustal evolution of western offshore of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Precambrian granitic basement rocks obtained from well BH-36 of Bombay High Field, western offshore of India has been studied both by Rb-Sr and K-Ar dating methods. Seven basement samples chosen from two cores have yielded whole rock Rb-Sr isochron age of $1446 \pm 67Ma$ with an initial $^{87}Sr/ ^{86}Sr$ ratio of $0.7062 \pm 0.0012$. This age has been interpreted as the formation/emplacement time of the granite. Two biotite fractions of different grain size separated from a sample CC6B2T have yielded Rb-Sr mineral isochron age of $1385 \pm 21$ Ma. However, these fractions when studied by K-Ar dating method have yielded slightly higher but mutually consistent ages of $1458 \pm 43Ma$ and $1465 \pm 43Ma$, respectively.</p>
					<p>Further, two biotites separated from additional samples CC5B9T and CC6B3B have yielded K-Ar ages of $1452 \pm 42Ma$ and $1425 \pm 40Ma$ with an overall mean age of $1438 \pm 19Ma$. This mean K-Ar age is indistinguishable from whole rock Rb-Sr isochron as well as mineral isochron age within experimental error. The similarity in the whole rock and biotite ages obtained by different isotopic methods suggests that no thermal disturbance has occurred in these rocks after their emplacement/formation around 1450Ma ago. The present study provides the evidence for the existence of an important Middle Proterozoic magmatic event around 1400--1450Ma on the  western offshore of India which, hitherto, was thought to be mainly confined to the eastern Ghats, Satpura and Delhi fold belt of India. This finding may have an important bearing on the reconstruction of Proterozoic crustal evolution of western Indian shield.</p>

				<title>Alkaline intrusion in a granulite ensemble in the Eastern Ghats belt, India: Shear zone pathway and a pull-apart structure</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0048</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The alkaline complex of Koraput, Orissa, India, is one of several bodies in the high-grade Eastern Ghats belt, but this one is an integral part of the high-grade belt and remote from the western boundary against the Bastar craton. The Koraput complex forms a lozenge-shaped intrusion into the metapelitic granulites and is bounded by shear zones. The combined effect of movement along these shear zones, is a northeasterly elongated sygmoidal cavity with maximum width along the northwesterly trending Reidel shear. Thus the Koraput alkaline complex can be considered to have been emplaced in a pull-apart structure, developed in the granulitic country rocks. Moreover, in view of the fact that the western margin of the high-grade Eastern Ghats belt bears clear evidence of collisional features, rather than that of rifting or break-up, the rift-valley model for the alkaline magmatism in this high-grade belt appears untenable.</p>

				<title>A direct inversion scheme for deep resistivity sounding data using artificial neural networks</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0049-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Initialization of model parameters is crucial in the conventional 1D inversion of DC electrical data, since a poor guess may result in undesired parameter estimations. In the present work, we investigate the performance of neural networks in the direct inversion of DC sounding data, without the need of a \textit {priori} information. We introduce a two-step network approach where the first network identifies the curve type, followed by the model parameter estimation using the second network. This approach provides the flexibility to accommodate all the characteristic sounding curve types with a wide range of resistivity and thickness. Here we realize a three layer feed-forward neural network with fast back propagation learning algorithms performing well. The basic data sets for training and testing were simulated on the basis of available deep resistivity sounding (DRS) data from the crystalline terrains of south India. The optimum network parameters and performance were decided as a function of the testing error convergence with respect to the network training error. On adequate training, the final weights simulate faithfully to recover resistivity and thickness on new data. The small discrepancies noticed, however, are well within the resolvability of resistivity sounding curve interpretations.</p>

				<title>Artificial neural network approach for estimation of surface specific humidity and air temperature using Multifrequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0089-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microwave sensor MSMR (Multifrequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer) data onboard Oceansat-1 was used for retrieval of monthly averages of near surface specific humidity (\textit {Q_a}) and air temperature (\textit {T_a}) by means of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The MSMR measures the microwave radiances in 8 channels at frequencies of 6.6, 10.7, 18 and 21 GHz for both vertical and horizontal polarizations.</p>
					<p>The artificial neural networks (ANN) technique is employed to find the transfer function relating the input MSMR observed brightness temperatures and output (\textit {Q_a} and \textit {T_a}) parameters. Input data consist of nearly 28 months (June 1999 -- September 2001) of monthly averages of MSMR observed brightness temperature and surface marine observations of \textit {Q_a} and \textit {T_a} from Comprehensive Ocean- Atmosphere Data Set (COADS).</p>
					<p>The performance of the algorithm is assessed with independent surface marine observations. The results indicate that the combination of MSMR observed brightness temperatures as input parameters provides reasonable estimates of monthly averaged surface parameters. The global root mean square (rms) differences are $1.0^\circ C$ and $1.1 g kg^{â1}$ for air temperature and surface specific humidity respectively.</p>

					<p>With the launch of the German Aerospace Agency's (DLR) Modular Opto-electronic Scanner (MOS) sensor on board the Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS-P3) launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in March 1996, 13 channel multi-spectral data in the range of 408 to 1010nm at high radiometric resolution, precision, and with narrow spectral bands have been available for a variety of land, atmospheric and oceanic studies. We found that these data are best for validation of radiative transfer model and the corresponding code developed by one of  the authors at Space Applications Centre, and called ATMRAD (abbreviated for ATMospheric RADi-ation). Once this model/code is validated, it can be used for retrieving information on tropospheric aerosols over ocean or land. This paper deals with two clear objectives, viz.,</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Validation  of ATMRAD model/code using MOS data and synchronously measured atmospheric data, and if found performing well, then to</li>
						<li>derive relationship between MOS radiances and Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The data validation procedure essentially involves</p>
					<ul>
						<li>near-synchronous measurements of columnar aerosol optical thickness and altitude profiles of aerosol concentration using ground-based multi-filter solar radiometers and Argon-ion Lidar, respectively and</li>
						<li>computation of the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiances from a low reflecting target (near clear water reservoir in the present study) using the ATMRAD model.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The results show that the model performance is satisfactory and a relationship between the spectral parameters of MOS radiances and aerosol optical thickness can be established. In this communication, we present the details of the experiments conducted, database, validation of the ATMRAD model and development of the relationship between AOT and MOS radiance.</p>

				<title>Estimation of spectral reflectance of snow from IRS-1D LISS-III sensor over the Himalayan terrain</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0117-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Marine and Water Resources Group, Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, 380 015, India. The sensor onboard the satellite views the earth as a plain surface and consequently the satellite obtained spectral radiances cannot represent true values over a mountainous terrain. The relative magnitudes of terrain slope and its aspect with respect to the sun's position will determine the amount of direct solar radiation incident on an undulating surface. Estimation of spectral reflectance from satellite data forms an important component in many of the snow and glacier studies. The spectral reflectance of snow is influenced by its various parameters. The changes in snowpack characteristics as a result of various metamorphic processes, with age, can cause variations in its spectral reflectances. Since, the terrain geometry also modifies the amount of reflected radiation from a rugged surface, one has to correct the estimated spectral reflectances for terrain topography so as to use them in deriving the snowpack characteristics accurately. Also, the amounts of melt runoff originating from glaciers having different slopes and orientations will not be the same. Considering these aspects, a model has been developed to estimate the terrain corrected spectral reflectances over the Himalayan terrain using the Linear Imaging Self Scanner-III data of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite. The model computes spectral reflectances from satellite based radiance measurements and includes the effect of the terrain topography on the incident solar radiation. The terrain slope and its aspect are generated from the digital elevation model of the region.</p>
					<p>The analysis carried out over the Beas Basin, Himachal Pradesh, India, indicated a variation of 22% in the amount of incident solar radiation for an increase of $10^\circ $ in terrain slope. Further, the terrain with south-east aspect received maximum amount of solar radiation. The large differences observed between the uncorrected and terrain corrected reflectances in the shortwave infrared band (B5), which is not saturated over the snow covered region, suggest that the terrain slope and its aspect cannot be neglected in estimating the accurate spectral reflectances over the Himalayan terrain.</p>

				<title>The evaporation of the charged and uncharged water drops suspended in a wind tunnel</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0129-0138</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A laboratory experiment has been performed to study the effect of ventilation on the rate of evaporation of the millimeter sized charged and uncharged water drops suspended in a vertical wind tunnel. The linear relationship, $\textit {f_v} = 0.907 + 0.282 \textit {X}$, observed between the mean ventilation coefficient, \textit {f_v}, and a non-dimensional parameter \textit {X}, ($\textit {X =N^{1/3} _{Sc,v} N^{1/2} _{Re}} where \textit {N_{Sc,v}} is Schmidt number and \textit {N_{Re}} is Reynold's number) is in agreement with the results of earlier investigations for uncharged water drops. However, in case of charged drops carrying $10^{â10}C$ of charge, this relationship gets modified to $ \textit {f_{v} = 0.4877 + 0.149X}$. Thus, the rate of evaporation of charged drops is slower than that of uncharged drops of the same size. Oscillations of the drop and the change in airflow around drops are suggested to contribute to lowering of the ventilation coefficients for charged drops. Applicability of the results to a small fraction of highly charged raindrops falling through the sub-cloud layer below thunderstorm is discussed. The relaxation time required for a ventilated drop to reach its equilibrium temperature increases with the drop size and is higher for  the charged than for the uncharged drops. It is concluded that in a given distance, charged drops will evaporate less than that of uncharged drops.</p>

				<title>Intra-Seasonal Oscillation (ISO) of south Kerala rainfall during the summer monsoons of 1901-1995</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0139-0150</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time series of daily averaged rainfall of about 40 rain gauge stations of south Kerala, situated at the southern-most part of peninsular India between latitudes about $8^\circ N$ and $10^\circ N$ were subjected to Wavelet Analysis to study the Intra Seasonal Oscillation (ISO) in the rainfall and its interannual variability. Of the 128 days, 29th May to 3rd October of each of the 95 years 1901-1995 were analysed. We find that the period of ISO does not vary during a monsoon season in most of the years, but it has large inter-annual variability in the range 23 to 64 days. Period-wise, the years cluster into two groups of ISO, the SHORT consisting of periods 23, 27 and 32 days and the LONG with a single period of 64 days, both the sets at a significance level of 99%. During the 95 years at this level of significance there are 44 years with SHORT and 20 years with LONG periods. 11 years have no ISO even at the 90% level of significance.</p>
					<p>We composited NCEP SST anomalies of the summer monsoon season June to September for two groups of years during the period 1965--1993. The first group is of 5 years with a LONG ISO period of 64 days for south Kerala rainfall at significance level of 99% and the second group is of 12 years with SHORT ISO periods of 23, 27 and 32 days at the same level of significance. The SST anomaly for the LONG (SHORT) ISO resembles that for an El Nino (La Nina).</p>

				<title>Tropical systematic and random error energetics based on NCEP (MRF) analysis- forecast system - A barotropic approach \textit {Part I: in physical domain}</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0151-0166</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deterministic predictability in the perspective of systematic and random error and their growth rates and different components of growth rate budgets like flux, pure generation, mixed generation and conversion in energy/variance form are investigated in physical domain for medium range tropical ($30^\circ S--30^\circ N$) weather forecast using daily horizontal wind field at 850 hPa up to 5-day forecast for the month of June, 2000 of NCEP (MRF) model.</p>
					<p>The study reveals the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Indian peninsula, the Indonesian region and their adjoining areas over $10^\circ N--20^\circ N$ latitudinal belt show a large amount of forecast error variance indicating that cumulus parameterization process may play a major role in the generation of tropical systematic error.</li>
						<li>Sparse observational networks over the tropical region are attributed to the uniform spread of random error over the continental as well as oceanic area. The results suggest that generation of random error in some geographical locations is perhaps due to the inefficient description of sensible heating process in the model.</li>
						<li>As far as growth rates are concerned, systematic error growth rate increases at initial forecast time and attains maximum value at 2-day forecast then it remains unchanged for rest of the forecast days. Whereas, the growth rate of random error is nearly invariant at 1 and 2-day forecasts and then it increases slowly at subsequent forecast time.</li>
						<li> Analyzing the flux, pure generation, mixed generation and conversion terms involved with the components of systematic and random error growth rate budget, it is shown that the components have their large variance in those regions where the respective error predominates.</li>

				<title>Tropical systematic and random error energetics based on NCEP (MRF) analysis- forecast system - A barotropic approach \textit {Part II: in wavenumber domain}</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0167-0195</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Systematic and random error and their growth rate and different components of growth rate budget in energy/variance form are investigated at wavenumber domain for medium range tropical ($30^\circ S--30^\circ N$) weather forecast using daily horizontal wind field of 850 hPa up to 5-day forecast for the month of June, 2000 of NCEP (MRF) model. Part I of this paper deals with the study at physical domain.</p>
					<p>The following are the major findings in this paper:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tropical systematic error is associated with large scale wave of wavenumber 2, unlike the tropical random error, in which case dominant spectra of random error are observed at higher spectral band of wavenumbers 4 - 7 in comparison to that of systematic error.</li>
						<li>Systematic error growth rate peak is observed at wavenumber 2 up to 4-day forecast then the peak is shifted to wavenumber 1 at 5-day forecast. Random error energy shows maximum growth at wavenumber 4 for 2-day forecast, wavenumber 6 for 3-4 day forecasts and at wavenumber 7 for 1-day and 5-day forecasts.</li>
						<li>In the error growth rate budget, flux of systematic error shows the net increase of error energy at wavenumber 1 through the triad interactions with the pairs of waves of other wavenumbers. Flux and pure generation of random error energy are found to be accumulated at wavenumber 4. Resolving the possible triads in wavenumber 4 associated with these terms, it is shown that the wave receives more energy from the pairs of waves of different wavenumbers than it loses, leading to the error energy peak at wavenumber 4. However, the significant triad interaction occurs among the wavenumber 2 and higher wavenumbers in systematic error energy flux.</li>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sea breeze characteristics around Kalpakkam tropical coastal site are studied using an Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) mesoscale model, which is non-hydrostatic, compressible atmospheric prediction model following the terrain coordinate system. Various options such as surface physics, atmospheric radiation physics, Coriolis force, microphysics, cumulus parameterization and 1.5 level TKE closure scheme for diffusion are included in the model.</p>
					<p>A joint meteorological field experiment was carried out by IITM-Pune and IGCAR at Kalpakkam by deploying state-of-the-art sensors and tether balloon systems for observing the height profiles of meteorological parameters. The data obtained from the field experiment are used here to compare the results from numerical simulations. From the simulated results, it is seen that duration of the sea breeze is 6 hours which agrees well with the observations. The height of the Thermal Internal Boundary Layer (TIBL) is also simulated from the vertical profiles of potential temperature. Simulated wind speed and wind directions are compared with the 50m tower data and potential temperature profiles are compared with the kytoon data. Results are in good agreement with the observed values except during night time wherein a small difference is seen in the wind speed.</p>

				<title>Spatial variability and rainfall characteristics of Kerala</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0211-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geographical regions of covariability in precipitation over the Kerala state are exposed using factor analysis. The results suggest that Kerala can be divided into three unique rainfall regions, each region having a similar covariance structure of annual rainfall. Stations north of $10^\circ N$ (north Kerala) fall into one group and they receive more rainfall than stations south of $10^\circ N$ (south Kerala). Group I stations receive more than 65% of the annual rainfall during the south-west monsoon period, whereas stations falling in Group II receive 25--30% of annual rainfall during the pre-monsoon and the north-east monsoon periods. The meteorology of Kerala is profoundly influenced by its orographical features, however it is difficult to make out a direct relationship between elevation and rainfall. Local features of the state as reflected in the rainfall distribution are also clearly brought out by the study.</p>

				<title>Proper depiction of monsoon depression through IRS-P4 MSMR</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0223-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, daily variations of satellite-derived geophysical parameters such as integrated water vapour (IWV), cloud liquid water content (CLW), sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface wind speed (SSW) have been studied for a case of monsoon depression that formed over the Bay of Bengal during 19th--24th August 2000. For this purpose, IRS P4 MSMR satellite data have been utilized over the domain equator-- $25^\circ N$ and $40^\circ --100^\circ E$. An integrated approach of satellite data obtained from IRS-P4, METEOSAT-5 and INSAT was made for getting a signal for the development of monsoon depression over the Indian region. Variations in deep convective activity obtained through visible, infrared and OLR data at 06UTC was thoroughly analyzed for the complete life cycle of monsoon depression. Geophysical parameters obtained through IRS-P4 satellite data were compared with vorticity, convergence and divergence at 850 and 200 hPa levels generated through cloud motion vectors (CMVs) and water vapour wind vectors (WVWVs) obtained from METEOSAT-5 satellite. This comparison was made for finding proper consistency of geophysical parameters with dynamical aspects of major convective activity of the depression.</p>
					<p>From the results of this study it is revealed that there was strengthening of sea surface winds to the south of low-pressure area prior to the formation of depression. This indicated the possibility of increase in cyclonic vorticity in the lower troposphere. Hence, wind field at 850 hPa with satellite input of CMVs in objective analysis of wind field using optimum interpolation (OI) scheme was computed. Maximum cyclonic vorticity field at 850 hPa was obtained in the region of depression just one day before its formation. Similarly, with the same procedure maximum anticyclonic vorticity was observed at 200 hPa with WVWVs input. Consistent convergence and divergence at 850 and 200 hPa was noticed with respect to these vorticities. In association with these developments, we could get lowest values of OLR ($120W/m^2$) associated with major convective activity that was consistent with the maximum values of integrated water vapour ($6--8 gm/cm^2$) and cloud liquid water content ($50--60 mg/cm^2$) persisting particularly in the southwest sector of the monsoon depression.</p>

				<title>Deformation of a layered half-space due to a very long tensile fault</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0235-0246</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of the coseismic deformation of an earth model consisting of an elastic layer of uniform thickness overlying an elastic half-space due to a very long tensile fault in the layer is solved analytically. Integral expressions for the surface displacements are obtained for a vertical tensile fault and a horizontal tensile fault. The integrals involved are evaluated approximately by using Sneddon's method of replacing the integrand by a finite sum of exponential terms. Detailed numerical results showing the variation of the displacements with epicentral distance for various source locations in the layer are presented graphically. The displacement field in the layered half-space is compared with the corresponding field in a uniform half-space to demonstrate the effect of the internal boundary. Relaxed rigidity method is used for computing the postseismic deformation of an earth model consisting of an elastic layer of uniform thickness overlying a viscoelastic half-space.</p>

				<title>Strains of scattering of near-field of a point source</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0247-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three dimensional scattering of near-field is studied for dilatation and rotation in the time domain. The perturbation method is applied to solve the equation of motion for the first order scattering from a weak inhomogeneity in an otherwise homogeneous medium. The inhomogeneity is assumed close enough to the point source so that the near-field intermediate wave is dominating over the far-field spherical \textit {P} and \textit {S} pulses. The integral expressions are derived to relate dilatation and rotation of scattering to the radial fluctuations of velocities and density in the inhomogeneity. These integrals are solved to calculate the strains of scattering from (a part of) an inhomogeneous spherical shell of arbitrary curvature. Variable curvature may allow the shape of inhomogeneity volume element to change uniformly from spherical to rectangular. Rotation of scattering from a spherical shell is independent of \textit {P} wave velocity inhomogeneity. Dilatation of scattering does  not involve \textit {S} wave velocity inhomogeneity but its gradient. The back scattering results are obtained as a special case. Strains are computed numerically, for hypothetical models to study the effects of various parameters viz., velocity inhomogeneity, distance of source from inhomogeneity and from receiver, and thickness of inhomogeneity. The curvature of the spherical shell is varied to study the effects of the shape of inhomogeneous volume element on scattering.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The seasonal cycle of temperature - salinity variations in the Bab el Mandab region (southern Red Sea) is described using CTD data collected during four cruises spread over the period May 1995--August 1997. A two layer system exists during early summer, winter and spring while a three layer system exists during summer. During summer, a large amount of the Gulf of Aden water intrudes into the Bab el Mandab region; up to the northern limit ($14.5^\circ N$). The quantity of Red Sea water that flows into the Gulf of Aden is maximum during the winter and minimum during the summer.</p>

				<title>The vorticity and angular momentum budgets of Asian summer monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0281-0298</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study delineates the vorticity and angular momentum balances of Asian summer monsoon during the evolution and established phases. It also elucidates the differences between these balances in the National Centre for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis and the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (NCM- RWF) analysis fields. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for a 40 year period (1958--97) and the NCM- RWF analysis for a three year (1994--96) period are made use of for the purpose. The time mean summer monsoon circulation is bifurcated into stable mean and transient eddy components and the mean component is elucidated.</p>
					<p>The generation of vorticity due to stretching of isobars balances most of the vorticity transported out of the monsoon domain during the evolution period. However, during the established period, the transportation by the relative and planetary vorticity components exceeds the generation due to stretching. The effective balancing mechanism is provided by vorticity generation due to sub-grid scale processes. The flux convergence of omega and relative momenta over the monsoon domain is effectively balanced by pressure torque during the evolution and established phases. Nevertheless, the balance is stronger during the established period due to the increase in the strength of circulation.</p>
					<p>Both the NCMRWF and NCEP fields indicate the mean features related to vorticity and angular momentum budgets realistically. Apart from the oceanic bias (strong circulation over oceans rather than continents), the summer monsoon circulation indicated by the NCEP is feeble compared to NCMRWF. The significant terms in the large-scale budgets of vorticity and angular momentum enunciate this aspect.</p>

The varying flattening is also revealed by the geometry of folds. The apparent buckle shortening of folds which ranges between 49 and 67 per cent with a majority of the folds having shortening values between 50% and 55% (exclusive of layer parallel strain) and inverse thickness method strain up to 50%. Besides flattening, the fold geometry was also modified by the pressure solution. This is borne by the presence of dark seams rich in phyllosilicates and disseminated carbonaceous material offsetting limbs of buckled quartz veins in slates.</p>

				<title>Influence of southern oscillation and SSTs over Nino-3.4 region on the winter monsoon rainfall over coastal Andhra Pradesh</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0313-0319</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An analysis of the mean monthly data of 124 years reveals that the relationship between the Southern Oscillation Index in September and the winter monsoon rainfall (WMR) over Coastal Andhra Pradesh (CAP) is variable and non-stationary. In the recent four decades, however, SOI (Sept) is negatively and significantly correlated with CAP WMR. A similar analysis is performed using 50 years of mean monthly SSTs over Nino-3.4 region in August and September and CAP WMR to detect a possible relationship and there is a striking positive relation between them. In both of the above cases, the September signal is more significant in the recent four decades than for the other months and seasons for probable prediction of CAP WMR. Finally, to examine the influence of SO on the winter monsoon rainfall, a non-parametric test "Mann-Whitney Rank Statistics" test has been applied to the rainfall associated with extreme positive and negative SOI events.</p>

				<title>Enrichment characteristics of radioelements in various types of rock from Sambalpur district, Orissa, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0321-0352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Over the years a large number of rock samples were collected by the explorationists of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), Department of Atomic Energy from Sambalpur district, Orissa, India. The variation of uranium enrichment with various types of rock in these samples was studied with an aim to help quick reviewing of toposheets in case of newly taken up areas, for uranium exploration. The radioelements U, Th and K determined for these samples are plotted in ternary diagrams for classifying them as being uraniferous or thoriferous with respect to various type of rocks, keeping the total natural content of radioelements (expressed by $eU_{3}O_{8}$) as a parameter.</p>
					<p>In this study it is seen that samples of quartzofeldspathic breccia type are enriched in uranium irrespective of their further sub classiffication and $eU_{3}O_{8}$ content. Granites are enriched in thorium when $eU_{3}O_{8}$ &mt; 100 ppm and are enriched in uranium when $eU_{3}O_{8} &lt; 100 ppm$. 
					<p>A database prepared for this purpose may be useful for reviewing toposheets in future.</p>

				<title>Observations of the atmospheric surface layer parameters over a semi arid region during the solar eclipse of August 11th, 1999</title>

				<page>0353-0363</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper discusses the observations of the Atmospheric Surface Layer (ASL) parameters during the solar eclipse of August 11th, 1999. Intensive surface layer experiments were conducted at Ahmedabad ($23^\circ 21^\prime N, 72^\circ 36^\prime E$), the western part of India, which was close to the totality path. This rare event provided by nature is utilised to document the surface layer effects during the eclipse period using measurements of high frequency fluctuations of temperature, tri-axial wind components as well as mean parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and subsoil temperature. Analysis showed that during the eclipse period, the turbulence parameters were affected leading to the suppression of the turbulence process, the main dynamic process in the atmospheric boundary layer, while the mean parameters showed variations within the natural variability of the observational period. The spectra of the wind components and temperature indicated decrease in  spectral power by one order in magnitude during the eclipse period. The rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy is found to decrease by more than one order during the eclipse period. The stability parameter showed a change from unstable to stable condition during the period of eclipse and back to unstable condition by the end of eclipse.</p>

				<title>The aeolian sedimentation record of the Thar desert</title>
				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0371-0401</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A review of the aeolian sedimentary record of the Thar desert is presented. This includes a regional survey of the major dune forms, their genesis and their relationship to climate and other regional landforms. A key aspect of this work is the chronometry of the dunes using luminescence methods. Luminescence dating of sand has enabled quantification of the duration of the phases of sand aggradation and quiescence, time scales of dune migration and the dating of pedogenic carbonates. We demonstrate that the conventional wisdom of synchronicity of dune aggradation with glacial epoch is not true in the context of Thar sands and here only a short duration \textit {window of opportunity} existed for dune aggradation. Luminescence ages further suggest that this window occurred during a transitional climatic regime from glacial to interglacial about 4--10 ka after the glacial epoch. Other inferences included are that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the aeolian activity in the Thar began over &lt; 150 ka, resolving that Thar is not of anthropogenic origin as suggested previously;</li>
						<li>the present spatial extent of the aeolian activity in the Thar is in a contracted stage compared to that in the geological past, which refutes the arguments on its rapid north-eastward expansion;</li>
						<li>the current dune migration rates in areas of significant human-induced disturbances are much higher than during the geological past;</li>
						<li>the monsoon activity in the Thar varied significantly, from being minimal during the isotopic marine stages 4 and 2 to being close to the present during stage 3;</li>
						<li>on shorter time scales the dune activities correlated with the lacustrine records of the region with a phase difference of a few centuries and a periodicity of $\sim 1500$ years;</li>
						<li>the sand aggradation climate in the southern margin in Gujarat gradually shrank northwards such that in general dunes older than 10 ka are seen in the extreme southern margin and dunes younger than 2 ka ages occur mostly in the western part of Rajasthan.</li>

				<title>Palaeoenvironmental history of Bap-Malar and Kanod playas of western Rajasthan, Thar desert</title>
				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0403-0425</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two playas in the arid core of the western margin of the Thar desert viz., Bap-Malar and Kanod, have been investigated using palynology, geomorphology, archaeology, AMS-radiocarbon dating, stable isotopes, evaporite mineralogy and geoarchaeology. The principal objective was to obtain a reliable lithostratigraphy of the playa sediments. These are about 7m thick in the Bap-Malar and &lt; 2.5 to 3m thick in the Kanod. AMS $^{14}C$ dates of &lt; 15 ka BP on pollen from sediment layers indicates that the Bap-Malar playa possibly existed even during the LGM. These playas were full of water during the early Holocene (8 ka BP -- 5.5 ka BP) and were ephemeral during the Pleistocene- Holocene transition and early to mid to late Holocene. The playas dried almost 1000 years earlier than those occurring on the eastern margin. Pollen of graminaceae, chenopodiaceae / amaranthaceae, cyperaceae etc. and evaporite minerals like gypsum, halite in the profiles indicate that the playas were surrounded by vegetation dominated by grass and that, they remained brackish to saline even during the mid Holocene, lake full stage. Stable dune surfaces, pediments with regoliths, and gravelly channels of ephemeral streams provided a favorable geomorphic niche for nomadic human activity since $\sim 7$ ka BP. Though local ecological factors have played an important role in the evolution of the playas, the winter rains, connected with northwesterly depressions, most likely played a vital role in maintaining these playas.</p>

				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0427-0451</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Luni river basin has been evolved as a result of typical hydrogeomorphic processes of arid zone, operating under the influence of active tectonic lineaments. A detailed analysis of stream morphology in relation to geology and lineaments carried out on selected windows indicated the morphological control of the streams while flowing over the lineaments from the eastern to the western part of the basin. Typical valley fills indicated by dark green tone on digitally processed images and the pediments showing greenish white tone appear in sharp contrast and indicate respectively the graben and horst structures. A detailed identification of lineaments for the georesources and geological evaluation has been carried out. Earlier analysis carried out on Bouguer anomalies correlate with graben and horst structures in the subsurface. Quaternary sequences have been dated from 80 ka to 3 ka indicating a range of fluvial to aeolian deposits reflecting prevailing climatic conditions. However, the changes in sediment type from coarse and mixed of all size grades to fine in a vertical litho-column warrant further studies on fine resolution stratigraphy and high resolution stratigraphy for understanding climatic variations in the region.</p>

				<title>Late Quaternary stratigraphic development in the lower Luni, Mahi and Sabarmati river basins, western India</title>
				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0453-0471</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study reviews the Quaternary alluvial stratigraphy in three semi-arid river basins of western India i.e., lower Luni (Rajasthan), and Mahi and Sabarmati (Gujarat alluvial plains). On the basis of OSL chronologies, it is shown that the existing intra-valley lithostratigraphic correlations require a revision. The sand, gravel and mud facies are present during various times in the three basins, however, the fluvial response to climate change, and the resulting facies associations, was different in the Thar desert as compared to that at the desert margin; this makes purely lithostratigraphic correlations unviable. It is further shown that the rivers in the Thar desert were more sensitive to climate change and had small response times and geomorphic thresholds as compared to the desert-margin rivers. This is illustrated during the early OIS 1, when the Luni river in the Thar desert was dynamic and showed frequent variations in fluvial styles such as gravel bedload braided streams, sand-bed ephemeral streams and meandering streams, all followed by incision during the early Holocene. The coeval deposits in Sabarmati, however, only show a meandering, floodplain-dominated river.</p>
					<p>Late Quaternary alluvial deposits in these basins unconformably overlie some older deposits that lack any absolute chronology. Based on the facies types and their associations, and the composition and architecture of the multistoried gravel sheets in the studied sections, it is suggested that older deposits are of pre-Quaternary age. This hypothesis implies the presence of a large hiatus incorporating much of the Quaternary period in the exposed sections.</p>

				<title>Calcretes in the Thar desert: Genesis, chronology and palaeoenvironment</title>
				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0473-0515</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The calcretes in the Thar desert occur in a variety of settings, including the piedmonts, sheet-wash aggraded plains; and this study adds calcretes in regolith and colluvio-alluvial plains to the group of settings in which calcretes occur in the region. Field logs, morphological details and analytical data such as petrographic, cathodoluminescence and geochemical characteristics are described along with a discussion on their implications. Sand dunes and sandy plains dating to &mt; 20 ka have weakly developed calcretes. The better-developed calcrete horizons occur in pied- monts, interdunes or in areas that have sufficient groundwater. Deep sections in the region show phases of calcrete development in aeolian sand aggradation at $\sim 150, \sim 100, \sim 60$ and 27--14 ka. The extensive sheetwash plains have mature calcretes and date to mid-Pleistocene. Our studies indicate that these calcretes represent a hybrid process, where carbonate enrichment of the originally calcareous host occurred due to periodically raised groundwaters, and its differentiation into nodules occurred under subaerial environment i.e., after recession of groundwater. Deep sections also show a stack of discrete calcretes that developed in individual aggradation episodes with hiatuses as indicated by ESR dating results. Nodules display a multiplicity of carbonate precipitation events and internal reorganization of calcitic groundmass. The process is accompanied by degradation and transformation of unstable minerals, particularly clays and with a neosynthesis of palygorskite.</p>
					<p>The ancient calcretes are dated from the beginning of the Quaternary to $\sim 600$ ka and show more evolved morphologies marked by brecciation, dissolution, laminar growth on brecciated surfaces, pisolites and several generations of re-cementation. Mica/chlorite schists and such other rocks are particularly vulnerable to replacement by carbonate. In an extreme case, replacement of quart-zose sandstone was observed also. The presence of stretches of alluvio-colluvial plains in an area presently devoid of drainage bespeaks of occasional high-energy fluvial regime, under a semi-arid climate. The mid-Pleistocene period saw a shift towards more arid climate and this facilitated sheetwash aggradation. Finally, during the late Pleistocene, aggradation of aeolian sands indicated a progressively drier climate. However, this does not find its reflection in stable isotope data. The amount of carbonate in the form of calcretes is substantial. The present studies indicate that aeolian dust or rainwater are minor contributors to the carbonate budget. A more important source was provided by the pre-existing calcretes in the sheetwash aggraded plains and detrital carbonate in the aeolian sediments. The original source of carbonate in the region, however, remains unresolved and will need further investigations. Electron spin resonance protocols for the dating of calcretes were developed as a part of this study and the results accorded well with geological reasoning.</p>

				<title>Trace element geochemistry of Amba Dongar carbonatite complex, India: Evidence for fractional crystallization and silicate-carbonate melt immiscibility</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0519-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbonatites are believed to have crystallized either from mantle-derived primary carbonate magmas or from secondary melts derived from carbonated silicate magmas through liquid immiscibility or from residual melts of fractional crystallization of silicate magmas. Although the observed coexistence of carbonatites and alkaline silicate rocks in most complexes, their coeval emplacement in many, and overlapping initial $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$ and $^{143}Nd/^{144}Nd$ ratios are supportive of their cogenesis; there have been few efforts to devise a quantitative method to identify the magmatic processes. In the present study we have made an attempt to accomplish this by modeling the trace element contents of carbonatites and coeval alkaline silicate rocks of Amba Dongar complex, India. Trace element data suggest that the carbonatites and alkaline silicate rocks of this complex are products of fractional crystallization of two separate parental melts. Using the available silicate melt-carbonate melt partition coefficients for various trace elements, and the observed data from carbonatites, we have tried to simulate trace element distribution pattern for the parental silicate melt. The results of the modeling not only support the hypothesis of silicate-carbonate melt immiscibility for the evolution of Amba Dongar but also establish a procedure to test the above hypothesis in such complexes.</p>

				<title>A preliminary geochemical study of zircons and monazites from Deccan felsic dikes, Rajula, Gujarat, India: Implications for crustal melting</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0533-0542</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zircons of 10â100 $\mu m$ size and monazites of up to 10 $\mu m$ size are present in rhyolite and trachyte dikes associated with Deccan basalts around Rajula in the southern Saurashtra Peninsula of Gujarat. On the basis of structural conformity of the felsic and basaltic dikes, K-Ar ages and trace element considerations, a previous study concluded that the felsic rocks are coeval with the Deccan Volcanics and originated by crustal anatexis. The felsic rocks contain two populations of zircons and monazites, one that crystallized from the felsic melt and the other that contains inherited crustal material. Trace element variations in the rhyolites and trachytes indicate that zircons and monazites crystallized from the felsic melts, but compositional analysis of a zircon indicates the presence of a small core possibly inherited from the crust. Hf compositional zoning proï¬le of this zircon indicates that it grew from the host rhyolitic melt while the melt differentiated, and Y and LREE contents suggest that this zircon crystallized from the host melt. Pb contents of some monazites also suggest the presence of inherited crustal cores. Hence, any age determination by the U-Th-Pb isotopic method should be interpreted with due consideration to crustal inheritance. Temperatures estimated from zircon and monazite saturation thermometry indicate that the crust around Rajula may have been heated to a maximum of approximately $900^\circ C$ by the intruding Deccan magma. Crustal melting models of other workers indicate that a 1--2 million year emplacement time for the Deccan Traps may be appropriate for crustal melting characteristics observed in the Rajula area through the felsic dikes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The northern margin of the Eastern Ghats Mobile belt against the Singhbhum craton exposes granitic rocks with enclaves from both the high-grade and low-grade belts. A shear cleavage developed in the boundary region is also observed in these granitoids. Field features and petrography indicate syn-tectonic emplacement of these granitoids. Petrology-mineralogy and geochemistry indicate that some of the granitoids are derived from the high-grade protoliths by dehydration melting. Others could have been derived from low-grade protoliths. Moreover, microstructural signatures in these granitoids attest to their syn-collisional emplacement.</p>

				<title>Charnockitic magmatism in southern India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0565-0585</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Large charnockite massifs cover a substantial portion of the southern Indian granulite terrain. The older (late Archaean to early Proterozoic) charnockites occur in the northern part and the younger (late Proterozoic) charnockites occur in the southern part of this high-grade terrain. Among these, the older Biligirirangan hill, Shevroy hill and Nilgiri hill massifs are intermediate charnockites, with Pallavaram massif consisting dominantly of felsic charnockites. The charnockite massifs from northern Kerala and Cardamom hill show spatial association of intermediate and felsic charnockites, with the youngest Nagercoil massif consisting of felsic charnockites. Their igneous parentage is evident from a combination of features including field relations, mineralogy, petrography, thermobarometry, as well as distinct chemical features. The southern Indian charnockite massifs show similarity with high-BaâSr granitoids, with the tonalitic intermediate charnockites showing similarity with high-BaâSr granitoids with low $K_{2}O/Na_{2}O$ ratios, and the felsic charnockites showing similarity with high-BaâSr granitoids with high $K_{2}O/Na_{2}O$ ratios. A two-stage model is suggested for the formation of these charnockites. During the first stage there was a period of basalt underplating, with the ponding of alkaline mafic magmas. Partial melting of this mafic lower crust formed the charnockitic magmas. Here emplacement of basalt with low water content would lead to dehydration melting of the lower crust forming intermediate charnockites. Conversely, emplacement of hydrous basalt would result in melting at higher $f_{H}_{2}O$ favoring production of more siliceous felsic charnockites. This model is correlated with two crustal thickening phases in southern India, one related to the accretion of the older crustal blocks on to the Archaean craton to the north and the other probably related to the collision between crustal fragments of East and West Gondwana in a supercontinent framework.</p>

				<title>Chemical evolution, petrogenesis, and regional chemical correlations of the flood basalt sequence in the central Deccan Traps, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0587-0603</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The lava sequence of the central-western Deccan Traps (from Jalgaon towards Mumbai) is formed by basalts and basaltic andesites having a signiï¬cant variation in $TiO_2$ (from 1.2 to 3.3 wt%), Zr (from 84 to 253 ppm), Nb (from 5 to 16 ppm) and Ba (from 63 to 407 ppm), at MgO ranging from 10 to 4.2 wt%. Most of these basalts follow a liquid line of descent dominated by low pressure fractionation of clinopyroxene, plagioclase and olivine, starting from the most maï¬c compositions, in a temperature range from $1220^\circ $ to $1125^\circ C$. These rocks resemble those belonging to the lowermost formations of the Deccan Traps in the Western Ghats (Jawhar, Igatpuri and Thakurvadi) as well as those of the Poladpur formation. Samples analyzed for $^{87}Sr/{86}Sr$ give a range of initial ratios from 0.70558 to 0.70621. A group of ï¬ows of the Dhule area has low $TiO_2$ (1.2â1.5 wt%) and Zr (84â105 ppm) at moderate MgO (5.2â6.2 wt%), matching the composition of low-Ti basalts of Gujarat, low-Ti dykes of the Tapti swarm and Toranmal basalts, just north of the study area. This allows chemical correlations between the lavas of central Deccan, the Tapti dykes and the northwestern outcrops. The mildly enriched high ï¬eld strength element contents of the samples with $TiO_2 &lt; 1.5 wt% make them products of mantle sources broadly similar to those which generated the Ambenali basalts, but their high La/Nb and Ba/Nb, negative Nb anomalies in the mantle normalized diagrams, and relatively high $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$, make evident a crustal input with crustally derived materials at less differentiated stages than those represented in this sample set, or even within the sub-Indian lithospheric mantle.</p>

				<title>High-Ti type N-MORB parentage of basalts from the south Andaman ophiolite suite, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0605-0618</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A complete dismembered sequence of ophiolite is well exposed in the south Andaman region that mainly comprises ultramaï¬c cumulates, serpentinite maï¬c plutonic and dyke rocks, pillow lava, radiolarian chert, and plagiogranite. Pillow lavas of basaltic composition occupy a major part of the Andaman ophiolite suite (AOS). These basalts are well exposed all along the east coast of southern part of the south AOS. Although these basalts are altered due to low-grade metamorphism and late hydrothermal processes, their igneous textures are still preserved. These basalts are mostly either aphyric or phyric in nature. Aphyric type exhibits intersertal or variolitic textures, whereas phyric variety shows porphyritic or sub-ophitic textures. The content of alkalies and silica classify these basalts as sub-alkaline basalts and alkaline basalts. A few samples show basaltic andesite, trachybasalt, or basanitic chemical composition. High-ï¬eld strength element (HFSE) geochemistry suggests that studied basalt samples are probably derived from similar parental magmas. $Al_{2}O_{3}/TiO_{2}$ and $CaO/TiO_2$ ratios classify these basalts as high-Ti type basalt. On the basis of these ratios and many discriminant functions and diagrams, it is suggested that the studied basalts, associated with Andaman ophiolite suite, were derived from magma similar to N-MORB and emplaced in the mid-oceanic ridge tectonic setting.</p>

				<title>Relative contributions of crust and mantle to the origin of the Bijli Rhyolite in a palaeoproterozoic bimodal volcanic sequence (Dongargarh Group), central India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0619-0648</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New mineralogical, bulk chemical and oxygen isotope data on the Palaeoproterozoic Bijli Rhyolite, the basal unit of a bimodal volcanic sequence \textit {(Dongargarh Group)} in central India, and one of the most voluminous silicic volcanic expressions in the Indian Shield, are presented. The Bijli Rhyolite can be recognized as a poorly sorted pyroclastic deposit, and comprises of phenocrystic K-feldspar + albite $\pm $ anorthoclase set in ï¬ne-grained micro-fragmental matrix of quartz-feldsparsericite- chlorite-iron-oxide $\pm $ calcite. The rocks are largely metaluminous with high $SiO_{2}, Na_{2}O+ K_{2}O, Fe/Mg, Ga/Al, Zr, Ta, Sn, Y, REE$ and low CaO, Ba, Sr contents; the composition points to an âA-type graniteâ melt. The rocks show negative Cs-, Sr-, Eu- and Ti- anomalies with incompatible element concentrations 2â3 times more than the upper continental crust (UCC). LREE is high ($La/Yb \sim 20$) and HREE 20--30 times chondritic. $\delta^{18} O_{whole-rock}$ varies between 4.4 and 7.8â°(mean $5.87 \pm 1.26â°$).</p>
					<p>The Bijli melt is neither formed by fractionation of a basaltic magma, nor does it represent a fractionated crustal melt. It is shown that the mantle-derived high temperature basaltic komatiitic melts/high Mg basalts triggered crustal melting, and interacted predominantly with deep crust compositionally similar to the Average Archaean Granulite (AAG), and a shallower crustal component with low CaO and $Al_{2}O_{3}$ to give rise to the hybrid Bijli melts. Geochemical mass balance suggests that $\sim $30% partial melting of AAG under anhydrous condition, instead of the upper continental crust (UCC) including the Amgaon granitoid gneiss reported from the area, better matches the trace element concentrations in the rocks. The similar Ta/Th of the rhyolites (0.060) and average granulite (0.065) vs. UCC (0.13) also support a deep crustal protolith. Variable contributions of crust and mantle, and action of hydrothermal ï¬uid are attributed for the spread in $\delta^{18}O_{whole-rock}$ values. The fast eruption of high temperature ($\sim 900^\circ C$) rhyolitic melts suggests a rapid drop in pressure of melting related to decompression in an extensional setting.</p>

				<title>Late Archaean mantle metasomatism below eastern Indian craton: Evidence from trace elements, REE geochemistry and Sr-Nd-O isotope systematics of ultramafic dykes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0649-0665</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Trace, rare earth elements (REE), Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and O isotope studies have been carried out on ultramafic (harzburgite and lherzolite) dykes belonging to the newer dolerite dyke swarms of eastern Indian craton. The dyke swarms were earlier considered to be the youngest mafic magmatic activity in this region having ages not older than middle to late Proterozoic. The study indicates that the ultramafic members of these swarms are in fact of late Archaean age (Rb-Sr isochron age $2613 \pm 177 Ma, Sr_{i} \sim 0.702 \pm 0.004$) which attests that out of all the cratonic blocks of India, eastern Indian craton experienced earliest stabilization event. Primitive mantle normalized trace element plots of these dykes display enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILE), pronounced Ba, Nb and Sr depletions but very high concentrations of Cr and Ni. Chondrite normalised REE plots exhibit light REE (LREE) enrichment with nearly flat heavy REE (HREE; ($\Sigma HREE)_{N} \sim 2--3$ times chondrite, $(Gd/Yb)_{N} \sim 1$). The $\varepsilon _{Nd}(t)$ values vary from +1.23 to â3.27 whereas $\delta^{18}O$ values vary from +3.16â° to +5.29â° (average $+3.97â° \pm 0.75â°$) which is lighter than the average mantle value. Isotopic, trace and REE data together indicate that during 2.6 Ga the nearly primitive mantle below the eastern Indian Craton was metasomatised by the fluid ($\pm $silicate melt) coming out from the subducting early crust resulting in LILE and LREE enriched, Nb depleted, variable $\varepsilon _{Nd}, low Sr_{i}(0.702)$ and low $\delta^{18}O$ bearing EMI type mantle. Magmatic blobs of this metasomatised mantle were subsequently emplaced in deeper levels of the granitic crust which possibly originated due to the same thermal pulse.</p>

					<p>The Kundal area of Malani Igneous Suite consists of volcano-plutonic rocks. Basalt flows and gabbro intrusives are associated with rhyolite. Both the basic rocks consist of similar mineralogy of plagioclase, clinopyroxene as essential and Fe-Ti oxides as accessories. Basalt displays sub-ophitic and glomeroporphyritic textures whereas gabbro exhibits sub-ophitic, porphyritic and intergrannu- lar textures. They show comparable chemistry and are enriched in Fe, Ti and incompatible ele- ments as compared to MORB/CFB. Samples are enriched in LREE and slightly depleted HREE patterns with least significant positive Eu anomalies. Petrographical study and petrogenetic mod- eling of [Mg]-[Fe], trace and REE suggest cogenetic origin of these basic rocks and they probably derived from Fe-enriched source with higher Fe/Mg ratio than primitive mantle source. Thus, it is concluded that the basic volcano-plutonic rocks of Kundal area are the result of a low to moderate degree (&mt; 30%) partial melting of source similar to picrite/komatiitic composition. Within plate, anorogenic setting for the basic rocks of Kundal area is suggested, which is in conformity with the similar setting for Malani Igneous Suite.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry and petrogenesis of early Cretaceous sub-alkaline mafic dykes from Swangkre-Rongmil, East Garo Hills, Shillong plateau, northeast India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0683-0697</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Numerous early Cretaceous maï¬c and alkaline dykes, mostly trending in N-S direction, are emplaced in the Archaean gneissic complex of the Shillong plateau, northeastern India. These dykes are spatially associated with the N-S trending deep-seated Nongchram fault and well exposed around the Swangkre-Rongmil region. The petrological and geochemical characteristics of maï¬c dykes from this area are presented. These maï¬c dykes show very sharp contact with the host rocks and do not show any signature of assimilation with them. Petrographically these maï¬c dykes vary from ï¬ne-grained basalt (samples from the dyke margin) to medium-grained dolerite (samples from the middle of the dyke) having very similar chemical compositions, which may be classiï¬ed as basaltic-andesite/andesite. The geochemical characteristics of these maï¬c dykes suggest that these are genetically related to each other and probably derived from the same parental magma. Although, the high-ï¬eld strength element (+rare-earth elements) compositions disallow the possibility of any crustal involvement in the genesis of these rocks, but Nb/La, La/Ta, and Ba/Ta ratios, and similarities of geochemical characteristics of present samples with the Elan Bank basalts and Rajmahal (Group II) maï¬c dyke samples, suggest minor contamination by assimilation with a small amount of upper crustal material. Chemistry, particularly REE, hints at an alkaline basaltic nature of melt. Trace element modelling suggests that the melt responsible for these maï¬c dykes had undergone extreme differentiation ($\sim 50%$) before its emplacement. The basaltic-andesite nature of these rocks may be attributed to this differentiation. Chemistry of these rocks also indicates $\sim 10â15%$ melting of the mantle source. The maï¬c dyke samples of the present investigation show very close geochemical similarities with the maï¬c rocks derived from the Kerguelen mantle plume. Perhaps the Swangkre-Rongmil maï¬c dykes are also derived from the Kerguelen mantle plume.</p>

				<title>Geodynamic evolution and crustal growth of the central Indian Shield: Evidence from geochemistry of gneisses and granitoids</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0699-0714</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rare earth element patterns of the gneisses of Bastar and Bundelkhand are marked by LREE enrichment and HREE depletion with or without Eu anomaly. The spidergram patterns for the gneisses are characterized by marked enrichment in LILE with negative anomalies for Ba, P and Ti. The geochemical characteristics exhibited by the gneisses are generally interpreted as melts generated by partial melting of a subducting slab. The style of subduction was ï¬at subduction, which was most common in the Archean. The rare earth patterns and the multi-element diagrams with marked enrichment in LILE and negative anomalies for Ba, P and Ti of the granitoids of both the cratons indicate interaction between slab derived melts and the mantle wedge. The subduction angle was high in the Proterozoic. Considering the age of emplacement of the gneisses and granitoids that differs by $\sim $ 1 Ga, it can be assumed that these are linked to two independent subduction events: one during Archaean (ï¬at subduction) that generated the precursor melts for the gneisses and the other during the Proterozoic (high angle subduction) that produced the melts for the granitoids. The high values of Mg #, Ni, Cr, Sr and low values of SiO2 in the granitoids of Bastar and Bundelkhand cratons compared to the gneisses of both the cratons indicate melt-mantle interaction in the generation of the granitoids. The low values of Mg#, Ni, Cr, Sr and high values of $SiO_2$ in the gneisses in turn overrules such melt-mantle interaction.</p>

				<title>Petrology of the prehistoric lavas and dyke of the Barren Island, Andaman Sea, Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0715-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although Barren Island (Andaman Sea, Indian Ocean) witnessed several volcanic eruptions during historic times, the eruptions that led to the formation of this volcanic island occurred mainly during prehistoric times. It is still active and currently in the fumarolic stage. Its volcanic evolution appears to be characterized by a constructive phase with the piling up of lava ï¬ows and scoria deposits and Strombolian activities, followed by a sudden collapse of the main cone. Deposits of a possible caldera-forming eruption were not recognized earlier. After a period of peri-calderic hydromagmatic activity, whose deposits presently mantle inner and outer caldera walls, a new phase of intracalderic Vulcanian activities took place. A prominent dyke in the SE inner side of the caldera wall was recognized. Petrographically the lava ï¬ows and dyke are similar but they differ in their chemical composition (viz., $SiO_{2}, MgO, Ni, Cr$) signiï¬cantly. Similarity in major, minor and trace element composition (viz., K/La, K/Nb, K/Rb, K/Ti ratios) of these rocks together with Chondrite normalized trace element (Rb, Ba, Sr, P, Zr, Ti and Nb) and REE (La, Ce, Nd and Y) patterns of the Barren Island prehistoric lava ï¬ows and dyke and low-K lavas of Sunda Arc indicates that Barren Island must have evolved from a source similar to that of Sunda Arc lavas during the Quaternary Period.</p>

				<title>Silica-poor, mafic alkaline lavas from ocean islands and continents: Petrogenetic constraints from major elements</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0723-0736</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Strongly silica-poor (\textit {ne}-normative), maï¬c alkaline lavas generally represented by olivine nephelinites, nephelinites, melilitites, and olivine melilitites have erupted at various locations during Earthâs history. On the basis of bulk-rock Mg#, high concentrations of $Na_{2}O, TiO_{2}$, and $K_{2}O$, and trace element geochemistry, it has been suggested that these lavas represent low-degree melts that have undergone little crystal fractionation \textit {en route} to the surface. Many of these lavas also carry highpressure mantle material in the form of harzburgite, spinel lherzolite, and variants of websterite xenoliths, and rare garnet-bearing xenoliths. However, phenocryst phases instead indicate that these magmas cooled to variable extents during their passage. We note subtle, yet important, differences in terms of CaO, $Al_{2}O_{3}, CaO/Al_{2}O_{3}$, and CaO/MgO. High-pressure experimental melting studies in $CMAS-CO_{2}$ (3â8GPa) and natural lherzolitic systems (3GPa) demonstrate that at an isobar increasing \textit {F} leads to a moderate decrease in CaO + MgO, whereas CaO/MgO and $CaO/Al_{2}O_{3}$ sharply decrease. Relatively high $CaO/Al_{2}O_{3}$ indicates melting in the presence of garnet ($\geq 85 km$). Studies also demonstrate that $CO_{2}$-bearing lherzolitic systems, when compared with anhydrous ones, also have higher CaO content in the coexisting melt at a given \textit {P} and \textit {T}. Comparison of the bulk-rock major-element chemistry of silica-poor, maï¬c alkaline lavas with experimentally determined high-pressure melts indicates that melting of anhydrous mantle lherzolite or garnet pyroxenite is not able to explain many of the major element systematics of the lavas. However, high-pressure partial melts of carbonated lherzolite have the right major element trends. Among ocean islands, lavas from Samoa and Hawaii are perhaps the products of very low degree of partial melting. Lavas from Gran Canaria and Polynesia represent products of more advanced partial melting. On continents, lavas from South Africa and certain localities in Germany are the products of a very low degree of partial melting, and those from Texas and certain other localities in Germany are products of a slightly more advanced degree of partial melting of a carbonated lherzolite. Lavas from Deccan, Czech Republic, and Freemans Cove are the products of even more advanced degree of partial melting. The mere presence of mantle xenoliths in some of these lavas does not necessarily mean that the erupted lavas represent direct mantle melts.</p>

				<title>Tectono-thermal evolution of the India-Asia collision zone based on $^{40}Ar-^{39}Ar$ thermochronology in Ladakh, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0737-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New $^{40}Ar-^{39}Ar$ thermochronological results from the Ladakh region in the India-Asia collision zone provide a tectono-thermal evolutionary scenario. The characteristic granodiorite of the Ladakh batholith near Leh yielded a plateau age of $46.3 \pm 0.6Ma (2\sigma )$. Biotite from the same rock yielded a plateau age of $44.6 \pm 0.3Ma (2\sigma )$. The youngest phase of the Ladakh batholith, the leucogranite near Himya, yielded a cooling pattern with a plateau-like age of $\sim 36$ Ma. The plateau age of muscovite from the same rock is $29.8 \pm 0.2Ma (2\sigma )$. These ages indicate post-collision tectonothermal activity, which may have been responsible for partial melting within the Ladakh batholith. Two basalt samples from Sumdo Nala have also recorded the post-collision tectono-thermal event, which lasted at least for 8MY in the suture zone since the collision, whereas in the western part of the Indus Suture, pillow lava of Chiktan showed no effect of this event and yielded an age of emplacement of $128.2 \pm 2.6Ma (2\sigma )$. The available data indicate that post-collision deformation led to the crustal thickening causing an increase in temperature, which may have caused partial melting at the base of the thickened crust. The high thermal regime propagated away from the suture with time.</p>

				<title>Magmatic underplating beneath the Rajmahal Traps: Gravity signature and derived 3-D configuration</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0759-0769</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The early Cretaceous thermal perturbation beneath the eastern continental margin of the Indian shield resulted in the eruption of the Rajmahal Traps. To understand the impact of the magmatic process that originated in the deep mantle on the lower crustal level of the eastern Indian shield and adjoining Bengal basin the conspicuous gravity anomalies observed over the region have been modelled integrating with available geophysical information. The 3-D gravity modelling has delineated 10â15km thick high-density ($\rho = 3.02 g/cm^{3}$) accreted igneous layer at the base of the crust beneath the Rajmahal Traps. Thickness of this layer varies from 16km to the west of the Rajmahal towards north to about 12km near Kharagpur towards south and about 18km to the east of the Raniganj in the central part of the region. The greater thickness of the magmatic body beneath the central part of the region presents itself as the locus of the potential feeder channel for the Rajmahal Traps. It is suggested that the crustal accretion is the imprint of the mantle thermal perturbation, over which the eastern margin of the eastern Indian shield opened around 117Ma ago. The nosing of the crustal accretion in the down south suggests the possible imprint of the subsequent magmatic intrusion along the plume path.</p>

				<title>Two- and three-dimensional gravity modeling along western continental margin and intraplate Narmada-Tapti rifts: Its relevance to Deccan flood basalt volcanism</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0771-0784</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The western continental margin and the intraplate Narmada-Tapti rifts are primarily covered by Deccan ï¬ood basalts. Three-dimensional gravity modeling of +70 mgal Bouguer gravity highs extending in the north-south direction along the western continental margin rift indicates the presence of a subsurface high density, maï¬c-ultramaï¬c type, elongated, roughly ellipsoidal body. It is approximately $12.0 \pm 1.2 km$ thick with its upper surface at an approximate depth of $6.0 \pm 0.6km$, and its average density is $2935 kg/m^{3}$. Calculated dimension of the high density body in the upper crust is $300 \pm 30km$ in length and $25 pm 2.5$ to $40 \pm 4 km$ in width. Three-dimensional gravity modeling of +10 mgal to â30 mgal Bouguer gravity highs along the intraplate Narmada-Tapti rift indicates the presence of eight small isolated high density maï¬c bodies with an average density of $2961 kg/m^3$. These maï¬c bodies are convex upward and their top surface is estimated at an average depth of $6.5 \pm 0.6$ (between 6 and 8 km). These isolated maï¬c bodies have an average length of $23.8 \pm 2.4 km$ and width of $15.9 \pm 1.5 km$. Estimated average thickness of these maï¬c bodies is $12.4 \pm 1.2 km$. The difference in shape, length and width of these high density maï¬c bodies along the western continental margin and the intraplate Narmada-Tapti rifts suggests that the migration and concentration of high density magma in the upper lithosphere was much more dominant along the western continental margin rift. Based on the three-dimensional gravity modeling, it is conjectured that the emplacement of large, ellipsoidal high density maï¬c bodies along the western continental margin and small, isolated maï¬c bodies along the Narmada-Tapti rift are related to lineamentreactivation and subsequent rifting due to interaction of hot mantle plume with the lithospheric weaknesses (lineaments) along the path of Indian plate motion over the RÂ´eunion hotspot. Maï¬c bodies formed in the upper lithosphere as magma chambers along the western continental margin and the intraplate Narmada-Tapti rifts at estimated depths between 6 and 8 km from the surface (consistent with geological, petrological and geochemical models) appear to be the major reservoirs for Deccan ï¬ood basalt volcanism at approximately 65 Ma.</p>

				<title>Emplacement kinematics of nepheline syenites from the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt, west of Khariar, NW Orissa: Evidence from meso- and microstructures</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0785-0793</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nepheline syenite plutons emplaced within the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt west of Khariar in northwestern Orissa are marked by a well-developed magmatic fabric including magmatic foliation, mineral lineations, folds and S-C fabrics. The minerals in the plutons, namely microcline, orthoclase, albite, nepheline, hornblende, biotite and aegirine show, by and large, well-developed crystal faces and lack undulose extinction and dynamic recrystallization, suggesting a magmatic origin. The magmatic fabric of the plutons is concordant with a solid-state strain fabric of the surrounding mylonites that developed due to noncoaxial strain along the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone during thrusting of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt over the Bastar Craton. However, a small fraction of the minerals, more commonly from the periphery of the plutons, is overprinted by a solid state strain fabric similar to that of the host rock. This fabric is manifested by discrete shear fractures, along which the feldspars are deformed into ribbons, have undergone dynamic recrystallization and show undulose extinction and myrmekitic growth. The shear fractures and the magmatic foliations are mutually parallel to the C-fabric of the host mylonites. Coexistence of concordant solid state strain fabric and magmatic fabric has been interpreted as a transitional feature from magmatic state to subsolidus deformation of the plutons, while the nepheline syenite magma was solidifying from a crystal-melt mush state under a noncoaxial strain. This suggests the emplacement of the plutons synkinematic to thrusting along the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone. The isotopic data by earlier workers suggest emplacement of nepheline syenite at 1500 + 3/â 4Ma, lending support for thrusting of the mobile belt over the craton around that time.</p>

				<title>The Neoproterozoic Malani magmatism of the northwestern Indian shield: Implications for crust-building processes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0795-0807</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Malani is the largest event of anorogenic felsic magmatism (covering $\sim 50,000km^2$) in India. This magmatic activity took place at $\sim 750Ma$ post-dating the Erinpura granite (850 Ma) and ended prior to Marwar Supergroup (680 Ma) sedimentation. Malani eruptions occurred mostly on land, but locally sub-aqueous conditions are shown by the presence of conglomerate, grits and pillow lava. The Malani rocks do not show any type of regional deformation effects. The Malanis are characterised by bimodal volcanism with a dominant felsic component, followed by granitic plutonism and a terminal dyke phase. An angular unconformity between Malani lavas and basement is observed, with the presence of conglomerate at Sindreth, Diri, and Kankani. This indicates that the crust was quite stable and peneplained prior to the Malani activity. Similarly, the absence of any thrust zone, tectonic mÂ´elange and tectonised contact of the Malanis with the basement goes against a plate subduction setting for their genesis. After the closure of orogenic cycles in the Aravalli craton of the northwestern shield, this anorogenic intraplate magmatic activity took place in a cratonic rift setting under an extensional tectonic regime.</p>

					<p>The nature and style of emplacement of Continental Flood Basalt (CFB) lava ï¬ows has been a atter of great interest as well as considerable controversy in the recent past. However, even a cursory review of published literature reveals that the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) and Hawaiian volcanoes provide most of the data relevant to this topic. It is interesting to note, however, that the CRBG lava ï¬ows and their palaeotopographic control is atypical of other CFB provinces in the world. In this paper, we ï¬rst present a short overview of important studies pertaining to the emplacement of ï¬ood basalt ï¬ows. We then brieï¬y review the morphology of lava ï¬ows from the Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) and the Columbia-Oregon Plateau ï¬ood basalts. The review underscores the existence of signiï¬cant variations in lava ï¬ow morphology between different provinces, and even within the same province. It is quite likely that there were more than one way of emplacing the voluminous and extensive CFB lava ï¬ows. We argue that the establishment of general models of emplacement must be based on a comprehensive documentation of lava ï¬ow morphology from all CFB provinces.</p>

				<title>Possible lava tube system in a hummocky lava flow at Daund, western Deccan Volcanic Province, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0819-0829</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A hummocky ï¬ow characterised by the presence of toes, lobes, tumuli and possible lava tube system is exposed near Daund, western Deccan Volcanic Province, India. The lava tube system is exposed as several exhumed outcrops and is composed of complex branching and discontinuous segments. The roof of the lava tube has collapsed but original lava tube walls and fragments of the tube roof are seen at numerous places along the tube. At some places the tube walls exhibit a single layer of lava lining, whereas, at other places it shows an additional layer characterised by smooth surface and polygonal cracks. The presence of a branching and meandering lava tube system in the Daund ï¬ow, which represents the terminal parts of Thakurwadi Formation, shows that the hummocky ï¬ow developed at a low local volumetric ï¬ow rate. This tube system developed in the thinner parts of the ï¬ow sequence; and tumuli developed in areas where the tube clogged temporarily in the sluggish ï¬ow.</p>

				<title>Cones and craters on Mount Pavagadh, Deccan Traps: Rootless cones?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0831-0838</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rootless cones, also (erroneously) called pseudocraters, form due to explosions that ensue when a lava ï¬ow enters a surface water body, ice, or wet ground. They do not represent primary vents connected by vertical conduits to a subsurface magma source. Rootless cones in Iceland are well studied. Cones on Mars, morphologically very similar to Icelandic rootless cones, have also been suggested to be rootless cones formed by explosive interaction between surface lava ï¬ows and ground ice. We report here a group of gentle cones containing nearly circular craters from Mount Pavagadh, Deccan volcanic province, and suggest that they are rootless cones. They are very similar morphologically to the rootless cones of the type locality of $M \acute{y} vatn$ in northeastern Iceland. A group of three phreatomagmatic craters was reported in 1998 from near Jabalpur in the northeastern Deccan, and these were suggested to be eroded cinder cones. A recent geophysical study of the Jabalpur craters does not support the possibility that they are located over volcanic vents. They could also be rootless cones. Many more probably exist in the Deccan, and volcanological studies of the Deccan are clearly of value in understanding planetary basaltic volcanism.</p>

				<title>Development and propagation of a pollution gradient in the marine boundary layer during INDOEX (1999)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The development and propagation of a pollution gradient in the marine boundary layer over the Arabian Sea during the Intensive Field Phase of the Indian Ocean Experiment (1999) is investigated. A hypothesis for the generation of the pollution gradient is presented. Infrared satellite images show the formation of the pollution gradient as the leading edge of a polluted air mass in the marine boundary layer and also its propagation over the Arabian Sea and the northern Indian Ocean. Aerosol data measured from two research vessels over the Arabian Sea show a variation in the concentrations caused by the passage of this pollution gradient. Depth of the pollution gradient was found to be about 800 m. A numerical model was used to simulate the development of this gradient and its propagation over the ocean. Results show that its formation and structure are significantly influenced by the diurnal cycle of coastal sea-land breeze circulations along India's west coast. Transport of aerosols and gases over the Arabian Sea in the lower troposphere from land sources appears to be through this mechanism with the other being the elevated land plume.</p>

				<title>Some characteristics of very heavy rainfall over Orissa during summer monsoon season</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Orissa is one of the most flood prone states of India. The floods in Orissa mostly occur during monsoon season due to very heavy rainfall caused by synoptic scale monsoon disturbances. Hence a study is undertaken to find out the characteristic features of very heavy rainfall (24 hours rainfall $\geq 125mm$) over Orissa during summer monsoon season (June--September) by analysing 20 years (1980--1999) daily rainfall data of different stations in Orissa. The principal objective of this study is to find out the role of synoptic scale monsoon disturbances in spatial and temporal variability of very heavy rainfall over Orissa.</p>
					<p>Most of the very heavy rainfall events occur in July and August. The region, extending from central part of coastal Orissa in the southeast towards Sambalpur district in the northwest, experiences higher frequency and higher intensity of very heavy rainfall with less interannual variability. It is due to the fact that most of the causative synoptic disturbances like low pressure systems (LPS) develop over northwest (NW) Bay of Bengal with minimum interannual variation and the monsoon trough extends in west--northwesterly direction from the centre of the system. The very heavy rainfall occurs more frequently with less interannual variability on the western side of Eastern Ghat during all the months and the season except September. It occurs more frequently with less interannual variability on the eastern side of Eastern Ghat during September. The NW Bay followed by Gangetic West Bengal/Orissa is the most favourable region of LPS to cause very heavy rainfall over different parts of Orissa except eastern side of Eastern Ghat. The NW Bay and west central (WC) Bay are equally favourable regions of LPS to cause very heavy rainfall over eastern side of Eastern Ghat. The frequency of very heavy rain- fall does not show any significant trend in recent years over Orissa except some places in north- east Orissa which exhibit significant rising trend in all the monsoon months and the season as a whole.</p>

				<title>Seasonal variability of physico--chemical characteristics of the Haldia channel of Hooghly estuary, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Physical and chemical characteristics of the Hooghly estuary during winter (December 1997--January 1998), summer (May 1998) and post-monsoon (November 1998) seasons have been stud-ied. Salinity varied spatially and temporally and seasonally during ebb and flood tide conditions. Water temperature showed a difference of $10^\circ C$ in winter to summer. Temperature did not vary much vertically as it is a well-mixed estuary. Strong currents exceeding $100 cm s^{-1}$ were observed during peak ebb and flood tide conditions irrespective of the season. Longitudinal eddy diffusion coeÂ±cient \textit {(K_x)} was estimated as $757m s^{-1}$ and $811m^{2} s^{-1}$ during summer and post-monsoon sea-sons, respectively. The vertical eddy diffusion coefficient $( \varepsilon_v)$ was estimated as $0.0337m^{2} s^{-1}$ during post-monsoon season. The salinity and current observations are compared with those obtained from models reported earlier. Values of pH, Dissolved Oxygen and Biological Oxygen Demand are within the threshold limits of the estuarine environment. Nutrients show seasonal variation in the estuarine environment. High values ($160--2686 mg l^{-1}$) of total suspended matter were noticed both at surface and bottom in the study region showing the impact of fresh water and sediment transportation.</p>

				<title>Compositional variation and genesis of ferromanganese crusts of the Afanasiy-Nikitin Seamount, Equatorial Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0051-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eight ferromanganese crusts (Fe--Mn crusts) with igneous and sedimentary substrates collected at different water depths from the Afanasiy--Nikitin Seamount are studied for their bulk major, minor and rare earth element composition. The Mn/Fe ratios &mt; 1.5 indicate the hydrogenetic accretion of the Fe--Mn hydroxides. These Fe--Mn crusts are enriched in Co (up to 0.9%, average $\sim 0.5%$) and Ce. The Ce-content is the highest reported so far (up to 3763 ppm, average $\sim 2250 ppm$) for global ocean seamount Fe--Mn crusts. In spite of general similarity in the range of major, minor, and strictly trivalent rare earth element composition, the dissimilarity between the present Fe--Mn crusts and the Pacific seamount Fe--Mn crusts in Co and Ce associations with major mineral phases indicates inter-oceanic heterogeneity and region-specific conditions responsible for their enrichment.  The decrease in Ce-anomaly (from $\sim 8 to \sim 1.5$) with increasing water depth (from $\sim 1.7km to \sim 3.2 km$) might suggest that the modern intermediate depth low oxygen layer was shifted and sustained at a deeper depth for a long period in the past.</p>

				<title>Biological productivity, terrigenous influence and noncrustal elements supply to the Central Indian Ocean Basin: Paleoceanography during the past $\sim 1Ma$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0063-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A 2 m-long sediment core from the siliceous ooze domain in the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB; $13^\circ 03^\prime S$: 74^\circ 44^\prime E$; water depth 5099 m) is studied for calcium carbonate, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, biogenic opal, major and few trace elements (Al, Ti, Fe, K, Mg, Zr, Sc,V, Mn, Cu, Ni, Zn, Co, and Ba) to understand the productivity and intensity of terrigenous supply. The age model of the sediment core is based on U--Th dating, occurrence of Youngest Toba Tuff of $\sim 74$ ka and Australasian microtektites of $\sim 770$ ka.</p>
					<p>Low carbonate content (&mt; 1%) of sediment core indicates deposition below the carbonate compensation depth. Organic carbon content is also very low, almost uniform (mean 0.2 wt%) and is of marine origin. This suggests a well-oxygenated bottom water environment during the past $\sim 1100$ ka. Our data suggest that during $\sim 1100$ ka and $\sim 400$ ka siliceous productivity was lower, complimented by higher supply of terrigenous material mostly derived from the metasedimentary rocks of High Himalayan crystalline. However, during the last $\sim 400$ ka, siliceous productivity increased with substantial reduction in the terrigenous sediment supply. The results suggest that intensity of Himalayan weathering, erosion associated with monsoons was comparatively higher prior to 400 ka. Manganese, Ba, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Co have around 90% of their supply from noncrustal (excess) source and their burial to seafloor remained unaffected throughout the past $\sim 1100$ ka.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Physico--mechanical properties of rocks have great significance in all operational parts in mining activities, from exploration to final dispatch of material. Compressional wave velocity (\textit {p}-wave velocity) and anisotropic behaviour of rocks are two such properties which help to understand the rock response under varying stress conditions. They also influence the breakage mechanism of rock. There are different methods to determine the \textit {p}-wave velocity and anisotropy \textit {in situ} and in the laboratory. These methods are cumbersome and time consuming. Fuzzy set theory, Fuzzy logic and Neural Networks techniques seem very well suited for typical geotechnical problems. In conjunction with statistics and conventional mathematical methods, hybrid methods can be developed that may prove to be a step forward in modeling geotechnical problems. Here, we have developed and compared two diÂ®erent models, Neuro-fuzzy systems (combination of fuzzy and artificial neural network systems) and Artificial neural network systems, for the prediction of compressional wave velocity.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0087-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The early Mesoproterozoic Rohtas Limestone in the Son valley area of central India represents an overall shallowing-upward carbonate succession. Detailed facies analysis of the limestone reveals outer- to inner-shelf deposition in an open marine setting. Wave-ripples, hummocky cross strat- ifications and edgewise conglomerates argue against a deep marine depositional model for the Rohtas Limestone proposed earlier. Stable isotope analysis of the limestone shows that $\delta ^{13}C$ and $\delta ^{18}O$ values are compatible with the early Mesoproterozoic open seawater composition. The ribbon limestone facies in the Rohtas Limestone is characterized by micritic beds, each decoupled in a lower band enriched and an upper band depleted in dissolution seams. Band-wise isotopic analysis reveals systematic short-term variations. Comparative enrichment of the heavier isotopes in the upper bands is attributed to early cementation from sea water and water derived from the lower band undergoing dissolution because of lowering of pH at depth. The short-term positive shifts in isotopic compositions in almost every upward gradational transition from a seamed band to a non-seamed band support the contention that dissolution seams here are of early diagenetic origin, although their formation was accentuated under overburden pressure.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The calculation of the deformation caused by shear and tensile faults is necessary for the investigation of seismic and volcanic sources. The solution of the two-dimensional problem of a long inclined shear fault in two welded half-spaces is well known. The purpose of this note is to present the corresponding solution for a tensile fault. Closed-form analytical expressions for the Airy stress function for a tensile line source in two welded half-spaces are first obtained. These expressions are then integrated analytically to derive the Airy stress function for a long tensile fault of arbitrary dip and finite width. Closed-form analytical expressions for the displacements and stresses follow immediately from the Airy stress function. These expressions are suitable for computing the displacement and stress fields around a long inclined tensile fault near an internal boundary.</p>

The purpose of this note is to obtain the corresponding solution for a blind fault. Since the solution is valid for arbitrary values of the fault-depth and the dip angle, the effects of these two important fault parameters can be studied numerically. The variation of the parallel displacement and shear stress with the distance from the fault is studied numerically for different values of the fault-depth and dip angle.</p>

				<title>Mineralogy and trace element chemistry of the Siliceous Earth of Barmer basin, Rajasthan: Evidence for a volcanic origin</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0111-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the presence of a 3--5 cm thick loose fragmental layer in the Siliceous Earth at Matti ka Gol in the Barmer basin of Rajasthan. Petrographic, chemical and mineralogical study reveals the presence of abundant volcanic debris such as glass shards, agglutinates, hollow spheroids, kinked biotites, feldspars showing oscillatory zoning, olivines, ilmenite and native iron. The presence of similar particles in the whole section suggests that the Siliceous Earth is a volcanic ash. Stratigraphic correlation, palynological and microvertebrate data suggest that the Siliceous Earth may have deposited over a short span of time during the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Palaeocene. In view of the possibility that this section may contain K/T impact debris, we looked for grains having impact signatures. Some patches of the Siliceous Earth of Bariyara show the presence of Ni-rich (&lt; 0.5%) vesicular glasses, sanidine spherules, magnesioferrite crystals, soot, etc., but because of their low abundance, it is not possible to establish if they are volcanic, micrometeorite ablation products or a part of the K/T impact ejecta.</p>

				<title>Kinematics of large scale asymmetric folds and associated smaller scale brittle--ductile structures in the Proterozoic Somnur Formation, Pranhita - Godavari valley, south India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0125-0142</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The development of structural elements and finite strain data are analysed to constrain kinematics of folds and faults at various scales within a Proterozoic fold-and-thrust belt in Pranhita--Godavari basin, south India. The first order structures in this belt are interpreted as large scale buckle folds above a subsurface decollement emphasizing the importance of detachment folding in thin skinned deformation of a sedimentary prism lying above a gneissic basement. That the folds have developed through fixed-hinge buckling is constrained by the nature of variation of mesoscopic fabric over large folds and finite strain data. Relatively low, irrotational Â°attening strain (X:Z -- 3.1--4.8, k &mt; 1) are associated with zones of near upright early mesoscopic folds and cleavage, whereas large flattening strain (X:Z -- 3.9--7.3, k &mt; 1) involving noncoaxiality are linked to domains of asymmetric, later inclined folds, faults and intense cleavage on the hanging wall of thrusts on the flanks of large folds. In the latter case, the bulk strain can be factorized to components of pure shear and simple shear with a maximum shearing strain of 3. The present work reiterates the importance of analysis of minor structures in conjunction with strain data to unravel the kinematic history of fold-and-thrust belts developed at shallow crustal level.</p>

				<title>Contrasting metamorphism across Cauvery Shear Zone, south India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0143-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Palghat Cauvery Shear Zone (CSZ) is a major shear zone that possibly extends into different fragments of Gondwanaland. In the present study maï¬c granulites occurring on either side of the CSZ in Namakkal area, southern India are examined. Textural features recorded in the maï¬c granulites are crucial in elucidating the metamorphic history of the southern granulite terrane (SGT).</p>
					<p>In the maï¬c granulites occurring to the south of CSZ, evidence of garnet breaking down during near isothermal decompression (ITD) is indicated by the development of orthopyroxene + plagioclase moats in between quartz and garnet. The presence of comparatively small elongated second generation garnet embedded in pyroxenes from the maï¬c granulites occurring to the north of CSZ is indicative of the garnet formation via reaction between pyroxenes and plagioclase, which occurred during isobaric cooling (IBC).</p>
					<p>Rocks occurring to the south of CSZ have recorded comparatively higher temperature and pressure ($849^\circ C$ and 9.6 kbar) than those occurring to the north of the CSZ ($731^\circ C$ and 8.6 kbar) using conventional geothermobarometry. The rocks occurring to the north of CSZ have suffered more complex metamorphic histories in comparison to the southern part. Integrating the results of the present ï¬eld and metamorphic studies with the earlier investigations and available geochronological data we suggest that the CSZ could represent a suture zone between two different continental blocks that underwent distinct metamorphic evolution.</p>

				<title>Reflection of P and SV waves from free surface of an elastic solid with generalized thermodiffusion</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0159-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The governing equations for generalized thermodiffusion in an elastic solid are solved. There exists three kinds of dilatational waves and a Shear Vertical (SV) wave in a two-dimensional model of the solid. The reflection phenomena of P and SV waves from free surface of an elastic solid with thermodiffusion is considered. The boundary conditions are solved to obtain a system of four non-homogeneous equations for reflection coefficients. These reflection coefficients are found to depend upon the angle of incidence of P and SV waves, thermodiffusion parameters and other material constants. The numerical values of modulus of the reflection coefficients are presented graphically for different values of thermodiffusion parameters. The dimensional velocities of various plane waves are also computed for different material constants.</p>

				<title>A moving boundary solution for solidification of lava lake and magma intrusion in the presence of time-varying contact temperature</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0169-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the solidification of a lava lake heat is released convectively from the top surface as well as conductively into the country rock from the base, leading to non-uniform solidification. The upper solidified layer grows at a faster rate than the lower solidified layer. Similarly, solidification of magma intrusion within the crust is also non-uniform due to the presence of thermal gradient in the crust. Available analytical solution for solidification of a melt layer assumes only symmetric cooling about the centre of the layer. In the present work a moving boundary solution for thermal evolution and non-uniform solidification of a melt layer incorporating time-varying contact temperature conditions at both of its boundaries is developed. The solution is obtained by using the Fourier spectral approach in the space domain and a modified finite difference scheme in the time domain, and is validated with available analytical solutions for simple cases and a semi-analytical solution for the case involving temperature gradient in the country rock. This solution can be used to analyse solidification of lava lakes and magma intrusions experiencing time-dependent temperature variation at their contacts with the country rock.</p>

				<title>IMF BY dependence of the extent of substorm westward electrojet</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0177-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper the duskward extension of the westward auroral electrojet is investigated for substorm intervals on the basis of magnetograms recorded at the Indian Antarctic station, Maitri. The database comprises three years from 1998--2000. Based on an initial study of the magnetograms, an arbitrary local time of 2030 MLT is fixed to define the early manifestation of the substorm westward electrojet. Using this criterion 12 substorms are identified and the possible causes examined. Many of these events are observed to be associated with a moderate to intense ring current.The hourly average of the GSM BY-component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) for the hour preceding the substorm onset at Maitri is negative for most of the events. It is suggested that the azimuthal shift of the auroral electrojets in the southern hemisphere resulting from a negative BY-component of the IMF influences the extent of the substorm westward electrojet. This finding implies that the IMF may have a role in controlling the longitudinal extent of substorm occurrence.</p>

				<title>Water quality assessment of Gautami -- Godavari mangrove estuarine ecosystem of Andhra Pradesh, India during September 2001</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0185-0190</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Some chemical and biological parameters were analysed at sixteen stations in the mangrove ecosystem, of the neighbouring Gautami--Godavari (GG) river estuary and Kakinada (KKD) bay to understand the present status of water quality and the impact of external terrigenous inputs during southwest (SW) monsoon in the study areas. High concentrations of nutrients in the mangrove ecosystem compared to the bay and estuarine ecosystems reveal the importance of this zone as a source of nutrients to the adjacent coastal ecosystems. Low Si :N:P (29 : 4 : 1) ratios in these ecosystems are due to the enrichment of these nutrients through external anthropogenic inputs even after the utilization by phytoplankton in the biological cycle. The mean Chl \textit {b}/Chl \textit {a} and Chl \textit {c}/Chl \textit {a} ratios and high phaeopigments (Pp) concentrations compared to Chl \textit {b} and high ratios of Chl \textit {a}/Pp suggests the possibility of the potential growth of phytoplankton populations in lower light intensity and low turbulent areas of these mangrove ecosystems.</p>

				<title>Climbing ripple structure and associated storm-lamination from a Proterozoic carbonate platform succession: Their environmental and petrogenetic signiÂ¯cance</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Aspects of Sedimentary Geology -- A Tribute to S K Chanda</feature>
				<page>0199-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Mesoproterozoic Pandikunta Limestone, a shallow water carbonate platform succession in the PranhitaâGodavari Valley, south India, displays well developed climbing ripple lamination and storm deposited structures, such as HCS, wave ripple-lamination, combined-flow ripple-lamination and low angle trough cross-stratification. Different types of stratification developed in calcisiltite with minor amounts of very fine quartz sand and silt. The climbing ripple structures exhibit a complex pattern of superposition of different types (type A, B and S) within cosets pointing to a fluctuating rate of suspension deposition \textit {versus} bedform migration, and an unsteady character of the flow. Close association of climbing ripple structures, HCS with anisotropic geometry, wavy lamination and combined-flow ripple-lamination suggest that the structures were formed by storm generated combined-flow in a mid-shelf area above the storm wave base. The combined-flow that deposited the climbing ripple structures had a strong unidirectional flow component of variable magnitude. The climbing ripple structure occurs as a constituent of graded stratified beds with an ordered vertical sequence of different types of lamination, reflecting flow deceleration and increased rate of suspension deposition. It is inferred that the beds were deposited from high-density waning flows in the relatively deeper part of the ancient shelf. The structures indicate that the Pandikunta platform was subjected to open marine circulation and intense storm activities.</p>
					<p>The storm deposited beds, intercalated with beds of lime-mudstone, consist primarily of fine sand and silt size carbonate particles that were hydrodynamically similar to quartz silt. Detrital carbonate particles are structureless and are of variable roundness. The particles were generated as primary carbonate clasts in coastal areas by mechanical disintegration of rapidly lithified beds, stromatolites or laminites, and the finest grade was transported to the offshore areas by stormgenerated currents.</p>

				<title>Tidal shelf sedimentation in the Neoproterozoic Chattisgarh succession of central India</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Aspects of Sedimentary Geology -- A Tribute to S K Chanda</feature>
				<page>0211-0226</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Neoproterozoic Kansapathar Sandstone of the Chattisgarh basin, a shallow marine shelf bar sequence, consists of mineralogically and texturally mature sandstones with subordinate siltstones, mudstones and conglomerates. The sediments were transported, reworked and deposited in subtidal environments by strong tidal currents of macrotidal regime as well as storms, and accumulated as discrete shoaling-upward features, separated from each other by muddy to low-energy sandy deposits. The sandbodies developed into shoaling up linear bars, often more than a kilometre in length, through accretion of thick cross-stratified units in transverse directions under the influence of ebb and flood tidal currents, as well as in longitudinal direction affected by southeasterly flowing along-shore currents. The aggrading upper surfaces of the bars experienced protracted reworking by strong oscillatory wave currents leading to extensive development of subaqueous 2D or 3D dunes mantled with lag pebble deposits at different points. With continued shoaling and progradation, thebars amalgamated into large sandstone sheets with the development of high energy beach depositsand coastal sand flats in the uppermost part of the sequence. The presence of rill marks, flat-topped ripples, wrinkle marks, desiccation cracks and adhesion warts point to intertidal conditions with intermittent exposure. The high energy sandstone bars overlie a thick mudstone-dominated shelf sequence across a sharp interface indicating rapid change in the sea-level, provenance, rate of sediment generation and sediment input, and circulation condition in the shelf. A quiet muddy shelf was replaced by a major sand-depositing environment with strong, open marine circulation. An interplay of tidal currents, oscillatory wave currents and storm currents generated a complex flow pattern that varied in time and space from bimodal--bipolar to strongly unimodal flows. Close parallelism of wave ripple crests, trend of linear bars and unidirectional flows suggest that the elongate bars were parallel to sub-parallel to the coastline, and were strongly influenced by along shore drift. The inferred coastline was broadly N{S. The large-scale structures in the bar sandstones, emplacement of vast amount of sand and migration of large bedforms under strong macrotidal currents collectively indicate that the Kansapathar shelf was intimately connected with an open ocean basin towards north--northwest.</p>

				<title>Provenance, tectonics and palaeoclimate of Proterozoic Chandarpur sandstones, Chattisgarh basin: A petrographic view</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Aspects of Sedimentary Geology -- A Tribute to S K Chanda</feature>
				<page>0227-0245</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sandstones of early Neoproterozoic Chandarpur Group, Chattisgarh Supergroup, central India display progressive change towards greater textural and mineralogical maturity from base to top of the succession. The clay-silt matrix decreases, sorting of sand grains improves, frequency of rounded grains increases, monocrystalline quartz content increases with concomitant decrease in polycrystalline quartz, feldspar and rock fragments. The trend of variations in different mineralogical and textural attributes, however, exhibits inflections at different stratigraphic levels. The sandstones of the basal Lohardih Formation are alluvial fan deposits, characterized by high matrix and feldspar content, iron-oxide impregnated highly angular grains and poor sorting. Petrographic properties collectively indicate that the sandstones were derived from a weathered granitic crust under a humid climatic condition. Abundance of well rounded grains within the alluvial fan and overlying braided fluvial deposit indicates prolonged wind action during episodes of high aridity. The shallow marine deposit overlying the fluvial deposits in the upper part of the Lohardih Formation exhibits bedto- bed variation in the frequency of angular grains, feldspar content and overall maturity suggesting environmentally controlled segregation of sediments. The abrupt appearance of coarse-grained immature sandstones with concomitant reappearance of iron-oxide impregnated/altered feldspar grains in the upper part of the shelf deposits of the Chaporadih Formation point to a phase of tectonic uplift that possibly triggered a regression. Continued regression and peneplanation heralded the deposition of supermature medium-grained purple quartzarenite of the upper shoreface Kansapathar Formation in the uppermost part of the Chandarpur succession under a hot desertic climatic condition. The provenance analysis revealed that the Chandarpur clastics were derived from granites and graniteâgneisses of a continental block tectonic provenance. Petrographic studies further indicate that high grade metamorphic rocks did not make any perceptible contribution to the Chandarpur system. The Eastern Ghats Granulite Belt apparently did not emerge till the early Neoproterozoic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Manganese carbonates interstratified with bedded chert in the Chanda Limestone of the Neoproterozoic Penganga Group at Adilabad, south India, have been studied for possible evidence that microbiota played a role in the mediation of early diagenetic Mn-carbonate formation in Precam- brian marine sedimentary successions. The manganese carbonate and chert beds occur within a below wave base, deep-water distally steepened ramp succession. High resolution SEM petrogra- phy of the manganese carbonates revealed two basic morphologies -- spherical to oval-cylindrical shaped microconcretions, and tubular to irregular, elongated, film-like microstructures. Infolded filmy to hollow tubular strand-like internal morphologies of the spherical to oval-cylindrical shaped microconcretions suggest their microbial affinity. The tubular and film morphologies with mesh- like interconnections closely resemble architectures of microbial extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Mineralization took place on these organotemplates by the process of permineralization as well as replacement in an early diagenetic pore-water environment with reduction of higher manganese oxy-hydroxides by organic matter and consequent increase in dissolved carbonate.</p>

				<title>Pull-apart origin of the Satpura Gondwana basin, central India</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Aspects of Sedimentary Geology -- A Tribute to S K Chanda</feature>
				<page>0259-0273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Gondwana basins of peninsular India are traditionally considered as extensional-rift basins due to the overwhelming evidence of fault-controlled synsedimentary subsidence. These basins indeed originated under a bulk extensional tectonic regime, due to failure of the attenuated crust along pre-existing zones of weakness inherited from Precambrian structural fabrics. However, disposition of the basins and their structural architecture indicate that the kinematics of all the basins cannot be extensional. To maintain kinematic compatibility with other basins as well as the bulk lateral extension, some basins ought to be of strike-slip origin. The disposition, shape and structural architecture of the Satpura basin, central India suggest that the basin could be a pull-apart basin that developed above a releasing jog of a left-stepping strike-slip fault system defined by the Son--Narmada south fault and Tapti north fault in consequence to sinistral displacement along WSW--ENE. Development of a sedimentary basin under the above-mentioned kinematic condition was simulated in model experiments with sandpack. The shape, relative size, stratigraphic and structural architecture of the experimental basin tally with that of the Satpura basin. The experimental results also provide insights into the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Satpura basin in particular and pull-apart basins in general.</p>

					<p>Basal part of the Gondwana Supergroup represented by Talchir and Karharbari Formations (Permo-Carboniferous) records an abrupt change-over from glacio-marine to terrestrial fluviolacustrine depositional environment. The contact between the two is an unconformity. Facies analysis of the glacio-marine Talchir Formation reveals that basal glaciogenic and reworked glaciogenic sediments are buried under storm influenced inner and outer shelf sediments. Facies associations of the Karharbari Formation suggest deposition as fluvio-lacustrine deposits in fault-controlled troughs. An attempt has been made in this paper to explain the sedimentation pattern in Talchir and Karharbari basins, and the abrupt change-over from glacio-marine to terrestrial fluviolacustrine depositional environment in terms of glacio-isostacy.</p>

				<title>Facies pattern of the middle Permian Barren Measures Formation, Jharia basin, India: The sedimentary response to basin tectonics</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Aspects of Sedimentary Geology -- A Tribute to S K Chanda</feature>
				<page>0287-0302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the Lower Gondwana succession of the Jharia basin of eastern India, the Barren Measures Formation is characterized by the cyclic disposition of fine-grained lacustrine deposits and relatively coarse-grained fluvial deposits. The cyclic variation in the rate of coarse clastic input is attributed to the sedimentary response to basin tectonics. The sandstoneâshale alternations of the Barren Measures succession can be correlated with the tectonic cyclothems developed on the hangingwall dip-slope and adjoining trough in a continental half-graben setting. Enhancement of the gradient of the hangingwall dip-slope during reactivation of the basin margin faults led to progradation of the existing fluvial system towards the half-graben trough and deposition of the coarser clastics on the fine-grained lacustrine deposits of the trough. Peneplanation of the hangingwall slope and slow increase in the lake level caused lacustrine transgression and retrogration of the fluvial system on the hangingwall block. The fluvial sediments were onlapped by the fine-grained lacustrine deposits. Episodic rejuvenation of the basin margin faults thus caused development of tectonic cyclothem on the hangingwall block. The paleocurrent pattern indicates that a persistent northward paleoslope was maintained during Barren Measures sedimentation. The inferred depositional settings were much more extensive than the present limit of the outcrop. The faults, presently defining the northern limit of the Barren Measures Formation, were possibly emplaced after Barren Measures sedimentation. The final movement along these fault planes caused preservation of the downthrown hangingwall block and the Barren Measures sediments on the footwall block were eroded during subsequent denudation. The Southern Boundary Fault came into existence after the deposition of the Barren Measures sediments.</p>

				<title>Evidence of lacustrine sedimentation in the Upper Permian Bijori Formation, Satpura Gondwana basin: Palaeogeographic and tectonic implications</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Aspects of Sedimentary Geology -- A Tribute to S K Chanda</feature>
				<page>0303-0323</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Upper Permian Bijori Formation of the Satpura Gondwana basin comprising fine- to coarsegrained sandstone, carbonaceous shale/mudstone and thin coal bands was previously interpreted as the deposits of meandering rivers. The present study documents abundance of wave ripples, hummocky and swaley cross-stratification and combined flow bedforms in the Bijori Formation, suggesting that a significant part of the formation was deposited in a wave-agitated environment. Evidence of near-emergent depositional conditions provided by repeated occurrence of rootlet beds and hydromorphic paleosols, local flooding surfaces denoting rapid fluctuation of water level, occurrences of temnospondyl vertebrate fossils, and absence of tidal signatures and marine fossils suggest a lacustrine rather than marine depositional regime. Five facies associations recognised within the Bijori Formation are inferred to represent fluvial channels and associated floodplains (FA1), lake shorelines (FA2), subaqueous distributary channels and associated levees (FA3), wave- and storm-affected delta front (FA4), and open lacustrine/lower shoreface (FA5) deposits. The planoconcave fluvial channel-fill sandbodies with unidirectional cross-beds are clearly distinguishable from the delta front bars that show a convexo-plan or bi-convex sandbody geometry and dominance of wave and combined flow bedforms. Some of the distributary channels record interaction of fluvial and wave-dominated basinal processes. Major distributary sandbodies show a north to northwest flow direction while wave-affected delta front sandbodies show very complex flow patterns reflecting interaction between fluvial discharge and wave processes. Wave ripple crest trends show that the lake shoreline had an overall eastânortheast to westâsouthwest orientation.</p>
					<p>The lack of documented contemporaneous lacustrine or marine sediments in the Satpura Gondwana basin posed a major problem of basin-scale palaeogeographic reconstruction. The existence of Bijori lake solves the problem and the lake is inferred to have acted as repository for the contemporaneous alluvial drainage. Development of the large Bijori lake body implies generation of accommodation space exceeding the rate of sediment supplied and thus represents locus of high tectonic subsidence. Transition of fluvial sediments with red mudstone and calcareous soil profile in the lower part of the succession to carbonaceous shale and coal-bearing lacustrine sediments in the upper part, denote a change from a warm semi-arid climate with seasonal rainfall to a more humid one.</p>

				<title>Depositional setting and vertebrate biostratigraphy of the Triassic Dockum Group of Texas</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Aspects of Sedimentary Geology -- A Tribute to S K Chanda</feature>
				<page>0325-0351</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Triassic strata of the Dockum Group in Texas comprise two major upward-ï¬ning alluvialâlacustrine depositional sequences. The two sequences are represented by the (1) Santa RosaâTecovas, and (2) TrujilloâCooper Canyon Formations. The second sequence is much thicker than the ï¬rst, and occupies a greater geographic part of the Dockum basin. Each sequence of alluvial and lacustrine sediment accumulation is characterized by sediment derivation from a different source terrain. The unconformable relationship between the two depositional sequences, the change in mineralogical composition and presumed source areas between these units, differences in paleocurrent orientation between units, and evidence for intervening episodes of local deformation indicate that the sequences are of tectonic origin. These strata are not the product of a single sediment dispersal system, such as the centripetally-drained lacustrine delta complex previously envisioned for the Dockum basin. Both Dockum sequences are comprised largely of two typical alluvial facies associations; stream channel facies, and overbank ï¬ood-plain facies, that are similar to those described in nearly all ï¬uvial deposits. In addition, the Dockum Group contains a peculiar lacustrine facies that accumulated in local ï¬ood-plain depressions, and probably resulted from subsidence over areas of subsurface salt dissolution. Vertebrate fossil assemblages are found in all three Dockum facies associations. Five fossiliferous sites in the Dockum are discussed in the context of these three depositional settings. The Dockum tetrapod diversity is reviewed in a hierarchical phylogeny with remarks on the history of collection, stratigraphic distribution of genera, and their taxonomic status. The stratigraphic ranges of tetrapod taxa do not support the recently proposed successive Otischalkian, Adamanian, Revueltian, and Apachean biochrons within the Dockum Group. Instead, a few index fossils provide a broad framework for correlation of Late Triassic nonmarine strata of the Dockum with the Carnian and Norian Alpine marine stages.</p>

				<feature>Special issue: Aspects of Sedimentary Geology -- A Tribute to S K Chanda</feature>
				<page>0353-0368</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sedimentary structures of some coastal tropical tidal ï¬ats of the east coast of India, and inner estuarine tidal point bars located at 30 to 50 kilometers inland from the coast, have been extensively studied under varying seasonal conditions. The results reveal that physical features such as ï¬aser bedding, herringbone cross-bedding, lenticular bedding, and mud/silt couplets are common to both the environments. In fact, ï¬aser bedding and lenticular bedding are more common in the point bar facies during the monsoon months than in the coastal tidal ï¬at environments. Interference ripples, though common in both the environments, show different architectural patterns for different environmental domains. Interference ripples with thread-like secondary set overriding the earlier ripple-form, resembling wrinkle marks, are the typical features in estuarine point bars near the high water region. Because structures which are so far considered as key structures for near-coastal tidal ï¬ats are common to both the environments, caution should be exercised for deciphering palaeo-environments, particularly for Proterozoic rocks, where one has to depend only on physical sedimentary structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Back scattered electron and transmission electron imaging of lunar soil grains reveal an abundance of submicrometer-sized pure $Fe^{0}$ globules that occur in the rinds of many soil grains and in the submillimeter sized vesicular glass-cemented grains called agglutinates. Grain rinds are amorphous silicates that were deposited on grains exposed at the lunar surface from transient vapors produced by hypervelocity micrometeorite impacts. $Fe^{0}$ may have dissociated from Fe-compounds in a high temperature ($&lt; 3000^\circ C$) vapor phase and then condensed as globules on grain surfaces. The agglutinitic glass is a quenched product of silicate melts, also produced by micrometeorite impacts on lunar soils. Reduction by solar wind hydrogen in agglutinitic melts may have produced immiscible droplets that solidiï¬ed as globules. The exact mechanism of formation of such $Fe^{0}$ globules in lunar soils remains unresolved.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sangla valley is situated at an altitude of $\sim 3500m$ above mean sea level and lies in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh. It is fed by river Baspa, a tributary of river Sutlej, that entrenches through the Quaternary glaciogenic deposits before emerging out of the valley and joining the river Sutlej at Karcham. The unstratified to stratified glaciogenic deposits consist of large boulders to fine silt and are classified into four major depositional facies on the basis of sedimentary texture and depositional environment. The facies -- basal conglomerates, debris flow, water/sheet flow and laminites -- represents the change in the environment of deposition from glaciofluvial to lacustrine and also the extent of the glacier to the valley floor during late Quaternary.</p>

				<title>Evidence of paleoearthquakes from trench investigations along Pinjore Garden fault in Pinjore Dun, NW Himalaya</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0387-0400</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Pinjore Garden Fault (PGF) striking NNWâSSE is now considered one of the active faults displacing the younger Quaternary surfaces in the piggyback basin of Pinjore Dun. This has displaced the older Kalka and Pinjore surfaces, along with the other younger surfaces giving rise to WSW and SW-facing fault scarps with heights ranging from 2 to 16m. The PGF represents a younger branch of the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) system. An $\sim 4m$ wide trench excavated across the PGF has revealed displacement of younger Quaternary deposits along a low angle thrust fault. Either side of the trench-walls reveals contrasting slip-related deformation of lithounits. The northern wall shows displacement of lithounits along a low-angle thrust fault, while the southern wall shows well-developed fault-related folding of thick sand unit. The sudden change in the deformational features on the southern wall is an evidence of the changing fault geometry within a short distance. Out of ï¬ve prominent lithounits identiï¬ed in the trench, the lower four units show displacement along a single fault. The basal unit âAâ shows maximum displacement of about To = 2.85 m, unit B = 1.8m and unit C = 1.45 m. The displacement measured between the sedimentary units and retro-deformation of trench log suggests that at least two earthquake events have occurred along the PGF. The units A and D mark the event horizons. Considering the average amount of displacement during one single event (2m) and the minimum length of the fault trace ($\sim 45 km$), the behaviour of PGF seems similar to that of the Himalayan Frontal Fault (HFF) and appears capable of producing large magnitude earthquakes.</p>

				<title>Acceleration of near-field scattering from an inhomogeneous spherical shell</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0401-0410</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The three dimensional scattering of near-field, from a point source, is studied for acceleration in the time domain. The perturbation method is applied to define the acceleration for the first order scattering from a weak inhomogeneity in a homogeneous surrounding. A body force, arising from the interaction between the primary waves and the inhomogeneity, acts as the source generating the scattered motion. The acceleration of scattered waves is related to the velocity and density fluctuations of the inhomogeneity. No restrictions are placed on the inhomogeneity size or locations of the source and receiver. Decoupling of scattered motion enables the identification of different phases. Integral expressions are derived for the scattering acceleration due to the incidence of near-field wave (from an impulsive point force) at a radially inhomogeneous volume element. These integrals are solved further for scattering from an inhomogeneous spherical shell. The accelerations for back scattering are obtained as a special case. These accelerations are simple analytically solvable expressions in closed form.</p>
					<p>Only spherical asymmetry of \textit {P} wave velocity inhomogeneity can affect the scattered \textit {S} acceleration. Scattered \textit {P} acceleration is affected by the gradient of \textit {S} wave velocity inhomogeneity. The back scattering of near-field from a spherical shell, is independent of radial inhomogeneity of \textit {P} wave velocity. Inhomogeneity with smoothly perturbed \textit {S} wave velocity does not back-scatter any acceleration. Accelerations are computed numerically for scattering from a part of inhomogeneous spherical shell. Hypothetical models are considered to study the effects of the distances of spherical shell from source, receiver, its thickness and its position relative to the direction of impulsive force.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Wave propagation is studied in a general anisotropic poroelastic solid saturated with a viscous fluid flowing through its pores of anisotropic permeability. The extended version of Biot's theory is used to derive a system of modified Christoffel equations for the propagation of plane harmonic waves in such media. The non-trivial solution of this system is ensured by a biquadratic equation whose roots represent the complex velocities of four attenuating quasi-waves in the medium. These complex velocities define phase velocity and attenuation of each quasi-wave propagating along a given phase direction in three-dimensional space. The solution itself defines the polarisations of the quasi-waves along with phase shift. The variations of polarisations of quasi-waves with their phase direction, are computed for a realistic numerical model.</p>

				<title>Impact of bogus vortex for track and intensity prediction of tropical cyclone</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0427-0436</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The initialization scheme designed to improve the representation of a tropical cyclone in the initial condition is tested during Orissa super cyclone (1999) over Bay of Bengal using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University -- National Center for Atmospheric Research (Penn State -- NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5). A series of numerical experiments are conducted to generate initial vortices by assimilating the bogus wind information into MM5. Wind speed and location of the tropical cyclone obtained from best track data are used to define maximum wind speed, and centre of the storm respectively, in the initial vortex. The initialization scheme produced an initial vortex that was well adapted to the forecast model and was much more realistic in size and intensity than the storm structure obtained from the NCEP analysis. Using this scheme, the 24-h, 48-h, and 72-h forecast errors for this case was 63, 58, and 46 km, respectively, compared with 120, 335, and 550km for the non-vortex initialized case starting from the NCEP global analysis. When bogus vortices are introduced into initial conditions, the significant improvements in the storm intensity predictions are also seen.</p>
					<p>The impact of the vortex size on the structure of the initial vortex is also evaluated. We found that when the radius of maximum wind (RMW) of the specified vortex is smaller than that of which can be resolved by the model, the specified vortex is not well adapted by the model. In contrast, when the vortex is sufficiently large for it to be resolved on horizontal grid, but not so large to be unrealistic, more accurate storm structure is obtained.</p>

					<p>Using the data of amplitude scintillations recorded at 244MHz from the geostationary satellite, FLEETSAT ($73^\circ E$) at a low latitude station, Waltair ($17.7^\circ N, 83.3^\circ E, 20^\circ N dip$), during the increasing sunspot activity period of 1997--2000, the effect of the geomagnetic storms on the occurrence of ionospheric scintillations has been studied. A total of 60 SC storms studied during this period, following the Aarons' criterion, reveals that the local time of onset of the recovery phase of the geomagnetic storms play an important role in the generation or inhibition of the ionospheric irregularities. Out of the 60 storms studied, nearly 60 to 70% satisfied the categories I, II and III of Aarons' criteria. However, in the remaining 30 to 40% of the cases, no consistent results were observed. Thus, there is a necessity for further investigation of the effect of geomagnetic storms on ionospheric irregularities, particularly with reference to the altitude variations of the F-layer (h'F) relating to the changes in the local electric fields.</p>

				<title>Changes in the source and transport mechanism of terrigenous input to the Indian sector of Southern Ocean during the late Quaternary and its palaeoceanographic implications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0443-0452</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Changes in the terrigenous sediment source and transport mechanisms during the late Quaternary have been investigated using four sediment cores within the Indian sector of Southern Ocean, using the magnetic susceptibility (MS)and sedimentological records.Sediments deposited during the Holocene and other interglacial periods were characterised by low MS,low sand content, reduced ice-rafted detritus (IRD)input and increased illite possibly transported via hydrographic advection from the south.The glacial intervals are characterised by high MS,high sand content, increased IRD input and reduced illite clays,derived from both local as well as Antarctic sources.  Signiï¬cant reduction in clay fraction and illite content during glacials suggests that the erosive and transporting capabilities of the deep and bottom waters could have reduced compared to the interglacial times.The changes in terrigenous in ï¬ux to this region were signi ï¬cantly in ï¬uenced by the rhythmic glacial âinterglacial ï¬uctuations in bottom circulation and the position of the Polar Front.</p>

				<title>Palaeoceanographic implications of abundance and mean proloculus diameter of benthic foraminiferal species \textit {Epistominella exigua} in sub-surface sediments from distal Bay of Bengal fan</title>

				<page>0453-0458</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Temporal variation in abundance and mean proloculus diameter of the benthic foraminiferal species \textit {Epistominella exigua} has been reconstructed over the last $\sim 50,000 yr$ BP,from a core collected from the distal Bay of Bengal fan,to assess its potential application in palaeoceanographic reconstruction studies.The down-core variation shows signiï¬cant change in abundance of \textit {E. exigua} during the last $\sim 50,000 yr$ BP.In view of the present day abundance of this species from areas with strong seasonal organic matter supply, we conclude that at $\sim 7, \sim 22, \sim 33$ and $\sim 46 kyr$ BP, strong seasonality prevailed in the distal Bay of Bengal fan,probably indicating either strong or prolonged northâeast monsoon or weakened southâwest monsoon.For the ï¬rst time,a strong correlation is observed in abundance and mean proloculus diameter of \textit {E. exigua} Based on coherent variation in mean proloculus diameter and abundance,it is postulated that mean proloculus diameter can also be used to infer increased seasonality in organic matter production,thus variation in strength or duration of monsoon.Thus,this study establishes that the down-core variation in the abundance and mean proloculus diameter of \textit {Epistominella exigua} can be used to infer past climatic variations from the distal Bay of Bengal fan.</p>

				<title>Hydrography of the eastern Arabian Sea during summer monsoon 2002</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0459-0474</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrographic observations in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS)during summer monsoon 2002 (during the ï¬rst phase of the Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX))include two approximately fortnight-long CTD time series.A barrier layer was observed occasionally during the two time series. These ephemeral barrier layers were caused by \textit {in situ} rainfall,and by advection of low-salinity (high-salinity)waters at the surface (below the surface mixed layer).These barrier layers were advected away from the source region by the West India Coastal Current and had no discernible effect on the sea surface temperature.The three high-salinity water masses,the Arabian Sea High Salinity Water (ASHSW),Persian Gulf Water (PGW),and Red Sea Water (RSW),and the Arabian Sea Salinity Minimum also exhibited intermittency:they appeared and disappeared during the time series.The concentration of the ASHSW,PGW,and RSWdecreased equatorward,and that of the RSW also decreased offshore.The observations suggest that the RSW is advected equatorward along the continental slope off the Indian west coast.</p>

				<title>Hydrography and water masses in the southeastern Arabian Sea during March-June 2003</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0475-0491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the hydrographic observations in the southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS)during two cruises carried out in March âJune 2003 as part of the Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment.The surface hydrography during March âApril was dominated by the intrusion of low-salinity waters from the south;during May âJune,the low-salinity waters were beginning to be replaced by the high- salinity waters from the north.There was considerable mixing at the bottom of the surface mixed layer,leading to interleaving of low-salinity and high-salinity layers.The ï¬ow paths constructed following the spatial patterns of salinity along the sections mimic those inferred from numerical models.Time-series measurements showed the presence of Persian Gulf and Red Sea Waters in the SEAS to be intermittent during both cruises:they appeared and disappeared during both the fortnight-long time series.</p>

					<p>Mandovi and Zuari are two estuaries located in Goa,west coast of India.Variation of water level in the estuaries was monitored for a month at 13 locations using tide-poles during March âApril 2003.Analysis of this data has provided for the ï¬rst time,characteristics of how tidal constituents vary in the narrow and shallow estuaries,typical of those found along the west coast of India.At a distance of 45 km from the mouth the tidal range increased in both estuaries by approximately 20%.The tidal range at the upstream end of the two channels at the stations dropped sharply because of the increase in elevation of the channels.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP)of India,as a whole,faces a severe shortage of water despite receiving a high annual rainfall,this is primarily due to excess runoff and lack of water conservation practices.In this study,an attempt is made to identify zones favourable for the application and adaptation of site-speciï¬c artiï¬cial-recharge techniques for augmentation of groundwater through a Geographical Information System (GIS)based hydrogeomorphic approach in the Bhatsa and Kalu river basins of Thane district,in western DVP.The criteria adopted for the GIS analysis were based on the hydrogeomorphological characteristics of both basins extracted from the IRS- 1C LISS-III data supported by information on drainage pattern,DEM derived slope,lineament density,drainage density,and groundwater condition.The integrated study helps design a suitable groundwater management plan for a basaltic terrain.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0515-0522</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Dhanbad district in Jharkhand faces acute water scarcity and is chronically drought-prone. The groundwater resources in the area have not been fully exploited.The present study was undertaken to evaluate the groundwater prospective zones.Landsat-5 Multi Spectral Scanner (MSS)data of band 2 and band 4 and false colour composite (FCC)of band 2,3,4 were interpreted visually to  differentiate different hydromorphogeological units and to delineate the major trends of lineaments.The different geomorphic features identiï¬ed are linear ridges, residual hills,and pediplain,buried pediment and dissected pediplain,besides lineaments.The study shows that the pediplain and buried pediments are promising zones for groundwater prospecting.The occurrence and movement of groundwater is restricted to the unconsolidated material, weathered and fractured rocks.For the selection of tube well sites,geoelectrical resistivity investigations have been carried out at the sites,which were found suitable based on hydro-geomorphological and hydrogeological studies.Twenty-six Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) have been carried out by using Schlumberger electrode con ï¬guration,which have brought out 3 to 7 layered sub-surface layers.The resistivity of water-bearing weathered/fractured rocks varies from 120 â150 ohmm.The integrated studies have revealed that the blue colour zones are most promising for groundwater exploration and dug wells may be dug up to depths of $30 \pm 5m$.</p>

				<title>Normalized impedance function and the straightforward inversion scheme for magnetotelluric data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0523-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper investigates the performance of normalized response function obtained by normalizing the Cagniard impedance function by a suitable factor and then rotating the phase by $45^\circ $ to make it purely real for homogeneous half-space and equal to the square root of the half-space resistivity.Two apparent resistivity functions based on respectively the real and imaginary parts of this response function are proposed.The apparent resistivity function using the real part contains almost the same information as that yielded by the Cagniard expression while the one using the imaginary part qualitatively works as an indicator of the number of interfaces in the earth model.The linear straightforward inversion scheme (SIS),developed by the authors employing the concept of equal penetration layers,has been used to validate the proposed apparent resistivity functions.For this purpose,several synthetic and ï¬eld models have been examined.Five synthetic models are studied to establish the veracity of the new functions and two well-studied published ï¬eld data sets are inverted through SIS for comparison.We noticed that the new function and SIS compliment each other and lead to better understanding of the data information and model resolution.</p>

				<title>River water quality in weathered limestone: A case study in upper Mahanadi basin, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0533-0543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stromatolitic limestone and calcareous shale belonging to Chattisgarh Supergroup of Proterozoic age dominate the upper part of the Mahanadi river basin.X-ray diffractogram (XRD)of limestone rocks show presence of a signiï¬cant amount of calcite,dolomite and ankerite.Shales of various colours contain calcite and dolomite.It is observed that congruent dissolution of carbonate minerals in the Charmuria pure limestone has given rise to a typical karst topography.On the other hand, limestones are also seen to support red and black soil pro ï¬les.This indicates that the limestone bedrock undergoes a parallel incongruent weathering,which leaves a residue of decomposed rock. The XRD analyses reveal that the limestone soils thus formed contain an assemblage of quartz,clays and Fe-oxides.It is likely that the silicate component trapped during deposition of the stromatolitic limestone  weathers incongruently resulting in diverse soil proï¬les.Carbonate and silicate mineral weathering schemes have been worked out to explain the soil formation,ï¬xation of Al in clay minerals,and Fe in goethite.The water quality parameters such as Ca,Mg and $HCO_{3}$ in the river water suggest under saturation with respect to calcite and dolomite.The mineral stability diagrams indicate that kaolinite and Ca-smectite are stable in the river water environment,hence they occur  in suspended sediments and soils.The dominant inï¬uence of carbonate weathering on the water quality is observed even in the downstream part of the river outside the limestone terrain.</p>

					<p>Many physico-chemical variables like rock-type,climate,topography and exposure age affect weathering environments.In the present study,an attempt is made to understand how the nature of clay minerals formed due to weathering  differs in tropical regions receiving high and low rainfall. Clay mineralogy of weathering pro ï¬les in west coast of India,which receives about 3 m rainfall through  two monsoons and those from the inland rain-shadow zones (&mt; 200 cm rainfall)are studied using X-ray diffraction technique.In the west coast,1:1 clays (kaolinite)and Fe âAl oxides (gibb-site/goethite)are dominant clay minerals in the weathering pro ï¬les while 2:1 clay minerals are absent or found only in trace amounts.Weathering pro ï¬les in the rain shadow region have more complex clay mineralogy and are dominated by 2:1 clays and kaolinite.Fe âAl oxides are either less or absent in clay fraction.The kaolinite âsmectite interstrati ï¬ed mineral in Banasandra pro ï¬les are  formed due to transformation of smectites to kaolinite,which is indicative of a humid paleo-climate.In tropical regions receiving high rainfall the clay mineral assemblage remains the same irrespective of the parent rock type.Rainfall and availability of water apart from temperature, are the most important factors that determine kinetics of chemical weathering.Mineral alteration reactions proceed through different pathways in water rich and water poor environments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data,kinetic energy and momentum transport of waves 0 to 10 at 850 hPa level are computed from monthly mean zonal \textit {(u )}and meridional \textit {(v )} components of  wind from equator to $90^\circ N$.Fourier technique is used to resolve the wind ï¬eld into a spectrum of waves.Correlation analysis between All India Seasonal Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR)and energetics of the waves indicates that effective kinetic energy of waves 1,3 and 4 around $37.5^\circ N$ in February has signiï¬cant correlation (99.9%)with the subsequent AISMR.A simple linear regression equation between the effective kinetic energy of these three waves and AISMR is developed.Out of 47 years â (1958 â2004)data,32 years (1958 â1989)are utilized for developing the regression model and the remaining 15 years (1990 â2004)are considered for its veri ï¬cation.Predicted AISMR is in close agreement with observed AISMR.The regression equation based on the dynamics of the planetary waves is thus useful for Long Range Forecasting (LRF)of AISMR.Apart from the regression equation,the study provides qualitative predictors.The scatter diagram between AISMR and effective kinetic energy of waves 1,3 and 4 around $37.5^\circ N$ indicates that if the kinetic energy is more (less)than $5 m^{2} s^{â2}$ ,the subsequent monsoon will be good (weak).Stream function ï¬elds indicate that high latitude trough axis along $40^\circ E(70^\circ E)$ leads to a good (weak)monsoon over India.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Before spacecraft exploration,facts about the Moon were restricted to information about the lunar orbit,angular momentum and density.Speculations about composition and origin were unconstrained.Naked eye and telescope observations revealed two major terrains,the old heavily cratered highlands and the younger mostly circular,lightly cratered maria.The lunar highlands were thought to be composed of granite or covered with volcanic ash-ï¬ows.The maria were thought to be sediments,or were full of dust,and possibly only a few million years old.A few perceptive observers such as Ralph Baldwin (Baldwin 1949)concluded that the maria were ï¬lled with volcanic lavas,  but the absence of terrestrial-type central volcanoes like Hawaii was a puzzle.</p>
					<p>The large circular craters were particularly difficult to interpret.Some thought,even after the Apollo ï¬ights,that they were some analogue to terrestrial caldera (e.g.,Green 1971),formed by explosive volcanic activity and that the central peaks were volcanoes.The fact that the craters were mostly circular was difficult to accommodate if they were due to meteorite impact,as meteorites would hit the Moon at all angles.The rilles were taken by many as de ï¬nitive evidence that there was or had been,running water on the lunar surface.Others such as Carl Sagan thought that organic compounds were likely present (see Taylor 1975,p.111,note 139).</p>

				<page>0601-0607</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the accretion of planets such as Earth,which are formed by collisional accretion of plan-etesimals,the probability of capture of interplanetary bodies in planetocentric orbits is calculated following the approach of Hills (1973)and the \textit {n} -body simulation,using simplectic integration method.The simulation,taking an input mass equal to about 50%of the present mass of the inner planets,distributed over a large number of planetoids,starting at 4 My after the formation of solar system,yielded four inner planets within a period of 30 My.None of these seed bodies,out of which the planets formed,remained at this time and almost 40%mass was transferred beyond 100 AU. Based on these calculations,we conclude that $\sim 1.4$ times the mass of the present inner planets was needed to accumulate them.The probability of capture of planetoids in geocentric orbits is found to be negligible.The result emphasizes the computational difficulty in âprobability of capture âof planetesimals around the Earth before the giant impact.This conclusion,however,is in contradiction to the recent observations of asteroids being frequently captured in transient orbits around the Earth,even when the current population of such interplanetary bodies is smaller by several orders of magnitude compared to the planetary accumulation era.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Moon-to-Earth low energy trajectories of âdetour âtype are found and studied within the frame of the Moon âEarth âSun-particle system.These trajectories use a passive ï¬ight to the Earth from an initial elliptic selenocentric orbit with a high aposelenium.The Earth perturbation increases the particle selenocentric energy from a negative value ï¬rst to zero and then to a positive one and therefore leads to a passive escape of the particle motion from the Moon attraction near the translunar libration point \textit {L_2}. This results in the particle ï¬ight to a distance of about 1.5 million km from the Earth where the Sun gravitation decreases the particle orbit perigee distance to a small value that leads to the particle approaching the Earth vicinity in about 100 days of the ï¬ight.A set of the Moon-to-Earth âdetour âtrajectories is de ï¬ned numerically.Characteristics of these trajectories are presented.The âdetour âtrajectories give essential economy of energy (about 150 m/s in Delta V)relative to the usual ones.</p>

					<p>Numerical investigations have been carried out to analyse the evolution of lunar circular orbits and the inï¬uence of the higher order harmonics of the lunar gravity ï¬eld.The aim is to select the appropriate near-circular orbit characteristics,which extend orbit life through passive orbit maintenance.The spherical harmonic terms that make major contributions to the orbital behaviour are identiï¬ed through many case studies.It is found that for low circular orbits,the 7th and the 9th zonal harmonics have predominant effect in the case of orbits for which the evolution is stable and the life is longer,and also in the case of orbits for which the evolution is unstable and a crash takes place in a short duration.By analysing the contribution of the harmonic terms to the orbit behaviour,the appropriate near-circular orbit characteristics are identiï¬ed.</p>

					<p>Among many scientiï¬c objectives of lunar exploration,investigations on lunar soil become attractive due to the existence of $He^3$ and ilmenite in the lunar soil and their possible utilization as nuclear fuel for power generation.Although the composition of the lunar surface soil can be determined by optical and $\gamma /X-ray$ spectrometers,etc.,the evaluation of the total reserves of $He^3$ and ilmenite within the regolith and in the lunar interior are still not available.In this paper,we give a rough analysis of the microwave brightness temperature images of the lunar disc observed using the NRAO 12 meter Telescope and Siberian Solar Radio Telescope.We also present the results of the microwave dielectric properties of terrestrial analogues of lunar soil and,discuss some basic relations between the microwave brightness temperature and lunar soil properties.</p>

					<p>Clementine was a technology demonstration mission jointly sponsored by the Department of Defense (DOD)and NASA that was launched on January 25th,1994.Its principal objective was to use the Moon,a near-Earth asteroid,and the spacecraft âs Interstage Adapter as targets to demonstrate lightweight sensor performance and several innovative spacecraft systems and technologies. The design,development,and operation of the Clementine spacecraft and ground system was per- formed by the Naval Research Laboratory.For over two months Clementine mapped the Moon, producing the ï¬rst multispectral global digital map of the Moon,the ï¬rst global topographic map, and contributing several other important scientiï¬c discoveries,including the possibility of ice at the lunar South Pole.New experiments or schedule modiï¬cations were made with minimal constraints, maximizing science return,thus creating a new paradigm for mission operations.Clementine was the ï¬rst mission known to conduct an in-ï¬ight autonomous operations experiment.After leaving the Moon,Clementine suffered an onboard failure that caused cancellation of the asteroid rendezvous.Despite this setback,NASA and the DOD applied the lessons learned from the Clementine mission to later missions.Clementine set the standard against which new small spacecraft missions are commonly measured.More than any other mission,Clementine has the most in ï¬uence (scientiï¬cally,technically,and operationally)on the lunar missions being planned for the next decade.</p>

					<p>The Clementine spacecraft orbited the Moon and acquired science data for 10 weeks in the Spring of 1994.During this time it collected global 11-band multispectral images and near global altimetry. Select areas of the Moon were imaged at 25 m/pixel in visible light and 60 m/pixel in thermal wavelengths.From these datasets a new paradigm for the evolution of the lunar crust emerged. The Moon is no longer viewed as a two-terrane planet,the Apollo samples were found not to represent the lunar crust as a whole,and the complexity of lunar crustal stratigraphy was further revealed.More than ten years later the Clementine datasets continue to signiï¬cantly advance lunar science and will continue to do so as new measurements are returned from planned missions such as Chandrayaan,SELENE,and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.This paper highlights the scientiï¬c research conducted over the last decade using Clementine data and summarizes the inï¬uence of Clementine on our understanding of the Moon.</p>

				<title>Chandrayaan-1: Science goals</title>

				<page>0701-0709</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The primary objectives of the Chandrayaan-1 mission are simultaneous chemical,mineralogical and topographic mapping of the lunar surface at high spatial resolution.These data should enable us to understand compositional variation of major elements,which in turn,should lead to a better understanding of the stratigraphic relationships between various litho units occurring on the lunar surface.The major element distribution will be determined using an X-ray ï¬uorescence spectrometer (LEX),sensitive in the energy range of 1 â10 keV where Mg,Al,Si,Ca and Fe give their K $\alpha $ lines.A solar X-ray monitor (SXM)to measure the energy spectrum of solar X-rays,which are responsible for the ï¬uorescent X-rays,is included.Radioactive elements like Th will be measured by its 238.6 keV line using a low energy gamma-ray spectrometer (HEX)operating in the 20 â250 keV region.The mineral composition will be determined by a hyper-spectral imaging spectrometer (HySI)sensitive in the 400 â920 nm range.The wavelength range is further extended to 2600 nm where some spectral features of the abundant lunar minerals and water occur,by using a near-infrared spectrometer (SIR-2),similar to that used on the Smart-1 mission,in collaboration with ESA.A terrain mapping camera (TMC)in the panchromatic band will provide a three-dimensional map of the lunar surface with a spatial resolution of about 5 m.Aided by a laser altimeter (LLRI) to determine the altitude of the lunar craft,to correct for spatial coverage by various instruments, TMC should enable us to prepare an elevation map with an accuracy of about 10 m.</p>
					<p>Four additional instruments under international collaboration are being considered.These are: a Miniature Imaging Radar Instrument (mini-SAR),Sub Atomic Re ï¬ecting Analyser (SARA), the Moon Mineral Mapper (M3)and a Radiation Monitor (RADOM).Apart from these scientiï¬c payloads,certain technology experiments have been proposed,which may include an impactor which will be released to land on the Moon during the mission.</p>
					<p>Salient features of the mission are described here.The ensemble of instruments onboard Chandrayaan-1 should enable us to accomplish the science goals de ï¬ned for this mission.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 will have a mass of 523 kg in a 100 km circular polar orbit around the Moon.The main factors that dictate the design of the Indian Moon mission are to use the present capability of launch vehicles and to achieve the scientiï¬c objectives in the minimum development time and cost.The detailed mission planning involves trade-off studies in payload optimization and the transfer trajectory determination that accomplishes these requirements.Recent studies indicate that for an optimal use of the existing launch vehicle and space- craft systems,highly elliptical inclined orbits are preferable.This indeed is true for the Indian Moon mission Chandrayaan-1.The proposed launch scenario of the Indian Moon mission program and capabilities of this mission are described in this paper,highlighting the design challenges and innovations.Further,to reach the target accurately,appropriate initial transfer trajectory characteristics must be chosen.A numerical search for the initial conditions combined with numerical integration produces the near accurate solution for this problem.The design of such transfer trajectories is discussed in this paper.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC)on India âs ï¬rst satellite for lunar exploration,Chandrayaan-1, is for generating high-resolution 3-dimensional maps of the Moon.With this instrument,a complete topographic map of the Moon with 5 m spatial resolution and 10-bit quantization will be available for scienti ï¬c studies.The TMC will image within the panchromatic spectral band of 0.4 to 0.9 $\mu m$ with a stereo view in the fore,nadir and aft directions of the spacecraft movement and have a B/H ratio of 1.The swath coverage will be 20 km.The camera is conï¬gured for imaging in the push broom-mode with three linear detectors in the image plane.The camera will have four gain settings to cover the varying illumination conditions of the Moon.Additionally,a provision of imaging with reduced resolution,for improving Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)in polar regions,which have poor illumination conditions throughout,has been made.SNR of better than 100 is expected in the $\pm 60^\circ $ latitude region for mature mare soil,which is one of the darkest regions on the lunar surface. This paper presents a brief description of the TMC instrument.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI)proposed for the ï¬rst Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 is aimed to study the topography of the Moon âs surface and its gravitational ï¬eld by precisely measuring the altitude from a polar orbit around the Moon.Altimetry data close to the poles of the Moon would also be available from the instrument,which was not covered by earlier missions. This instrument supplements the terrain mapping camera and hyper-spectral imager payloads on Chandrayaan-1.The instrument consists of a diode pumped Nd:YAG pulsed laser transmitter having 10 nsec pulse width and a receiver system.The receiver system features 17 cm diameter Ritchey âChr$\acute{e} $tien collecting optics,Si Avalanche Photo Detector (APD),preampli ï¬ers,constant fraction discriminators,time-of-ï¬ight measurement unit and spacecraft interface.Altimeter resolution of better than 5 m is targeted.The received signal strength of LLRI depends on laser pulse backscatter from the Moon âs surface.Moon âs surface being a poor re ï¬ector,the choice of receiver size and its type and the selection of detector play an important role in getting a good signal-to-noise ratio and in turn achieving the target resolution.At the same time,the spacecraft puts a limitation on payload size and weight.This paper discusses the proposed LLRI system for Chandrayaan-1 and signal-to-noise ratio estimation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Chandrayaan-1 mission to the Moon scheduled for launch in late 2007 will include a high energy X-ray spectrometer (HEX)for detection of naturally occurring emissions from the lunar surface due to radioactive decay of the $^{238} U$ and $^{232}Th$ series nuclides in the energy region 20 â250 keV.The primary science objective is to study the transport of volatiles on the lunar surface by detection of the 46.5 keV line from radioactive $^{210}Pb$, a decay product of the gaseous $^{222}Rn$,both of which are members of the $^{238} U$ decay series.Mapping of U and Th concentration over the lunar surface,particularly in the polar and U âTh rich regions will also be attempted through detection of prominent lines from the U and Th decay series in the above energy range.The low signal strengths of these emissions require a detector with high sensitivity and good energy resolution.Pixelated Cadmium â Zinc âTelluride (CZT)array detectors having these characteristics will be used in this experiment. Here we describe the science considerations that led to this experiment,anticipated ï¬ux and back- ground (lunar continuum),the choice of detectors,the proposed payload con ï¬guration and plans for its realization.</p>

				<title>Imaging and power generation strategies for Chandrayaan-1</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Proceedings of the International Conference on Exploration and Utilization of the Moon 22 â 26 November 2004 Udaipur, Rajasthan, India</feature>
				<page>0739-0748</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Chandrayaan-1 mission proposes to put a 550 kg lunarcraft into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO)using the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)which will subsequently be transferred into a 100 km circular lunar polar orbit for imaging purposes.In this paper,we describe certain aspects of mission strategies which will allow optimum power generation and imaging of the lunar surface.</p>
					<p>The lunar orbit considered is circular and polar and therefore nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.Unlike an Earth orbiting remote sensing satellite,the orbit plane of lunar orbiter is inertially ï¬xed as a consequence of the very small oblateness of the Moon.The Earth rotates around the Sun once a year,resulting in an apparent motion of Sun around this orbit in a year.Two extreme situations can be identiï¬ed concerning the solar illumination of the lunar orbit,noon/midnight orbit,where the Sun vector is parallel to the spacecraft orbit plane and dawn/dusk orbit,where the Sun vector is perpendicular to the spacecraft orbit plane.This scenario directly affects the solar panel conï¬guration.In case the solar panels are not canted,during the noon/midnight orbit, 100%power is generated,whereas during the dawn/dusk orbit,zero power is generated.Hence for optimum power generation,canting of the panels is essential.Detailed analysis was carriedout to ï¬x optimum canting and also determine a strategy to maintain optimum power generation throughout the year.The analysis led to the strategy of $180^\circ $ yaw rotation at noon/midnight orbits and ï¬ipping the solar panel by $180^\circ $ at dawn/dusk orbits.This also resulted in the negative pitch face of the lunarcraft to be an anti-sun panel,which is very useful for thermal design,and further to meet cooling requirements of the spectrometers.</p>
					<p>In principle the Moon âs surface can be imaged in 28 days,because the orbit chosen and the payload swath provide adequate overlap.However,in reality it is not possible to complete the imaging in 28 days due to various mission constraints like maximum duration of imaging allowed keeping in view the SSR sizing and payloads data input rate,time required for downlinking the payload data,data compression requirements and visibility of the lunarcraft for the Bangalore DSN. In each cycle,all the latitudes are swept.Due to the constraints mentioned,only $60^\circ $ latitude arc coverage is possible in each orbit.As Bangalore DSN is the only station,half of the orbits in a day are not available.The longitudinal gaps because of non-visibility are covered in the next cycle by Bangalore DSN.Hence,in the ï¬rst \textit {prime imaging season} only 25% of the prime imaging zones are covered,and an additional three \textit {prime imaging seasons} are required for a full coverage of the Moon in two years.Strategy is also planned to cover X-ray payload coverage considering swath and orbit shift.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports on the Sub-keV Atom Reï¬ecting Analyzer (SARA)experiment that will be ï¬own on the ï¬rst Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1.The SARA is a low energy neutral atom (LENA)imaging mass spectrometer,which will perform remote sensing of the lunar surface via detection of neutral atoms in the energy range from 10 eV to 3 keV from a 100 km polar orbit.In this report we present the basic design of the SARA experiment and discuss various scientiï¬c issues that will be addressed.The SARA instrument consists of three major subsystems:a LENA sensor (CENA),a solar wind monitor (SWIM),and a digital processing unit (DPU).SARA will be used to image the solar wind âsurface interaction to study primarily the surface composition and surface magnetic anomalies and associated mini-magnetospheres.Studies of lunar exosphere sources and space weathering on the Moon will also be attempted.SARA is the ï¬rst LENA imaging mass spectrometer of its kind to be ï¬own on a space mission.A replica of SARA is planned to ï¬y to Mercury onboard the BepiColombo mission.</p>

				<title>Lunar-A mission: Outline and current status</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Proceedings of the International Conference on Exploration and Utilization of the Moon 22 â 26 November 2004 Udaipur, Rajasthan, India</feature>
				<page>0763-0768</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The scientiï¬c objective of the Lunar-A,Japanese Penetrator Mission,is to explore the lunar interior by seismic and heat-ï¬ow experiments.Two penetrators containing two seismometers (horizontal and vertical components)and heat-ï¬ow probes will be deployed from a spacecraft onto the lunar surface,one on the near-side and the other on the far-side of the moon.The data obtained by the penetrators will be transmitted to the earth station via the Lunar-A mother spacecraft orbiting at an altitude of about 200 km.</p>
					<p>The spacecraft of a cylindrical shape,2.2 m in maximum diameter and 1.7 m in height,is designed to be spin-stabilized.The spacecraft will be inserted into an elliptic lunar orbit,after about a half- year cruise during which complex manoeuvering is made using the lunar-solar gravity assist.After lunar orbit insertion,two penetrators will be separated from the spacecraft near perilune,one by one,and will be landed on the lunar surface.</p>
					<p>The ï¬nal impact velocity of the penetrator will be about 285 m/sec;it will encounter a shock of about 8000 G at impact on the lunar surface.According to numerous experimental impact tests using model penetrators and a lunar-regolith analog target,each penetrator is predicted to penetrate to a depth between l and 3 m,depending on the hardness and/or particle-size distribution of the lunar regolith.The penetration depth is important for ensuring the temperature stability of the instruments in the penetrator and heat ï¬ow measurements.According to the results of the Apollo heat ï¬ow experiment,an insulating regolith blanket of only 30 cm is sufficient to dampen out about 280 K lunar surface temperature ï¬uctuation to &mt; 3K variation.</p>
					<p>The seismic observations are expected to provide key data on the size of the lunar core,as well as data on deep lunar mantle structure.The heat ï¬ow measurements at two penetrator-landing sites will also provide important data on the thermal structure and bulk concentrations of heat- generating elements in the Moon.These data will provide much stronger geophysical constraints on the origin and evolution of the Moon than has been obtained so far.</p>
					<p>Currently,the Lunar-A system is being reviewed and a more robust system for communication between the penetrators and spacecraft is being implemented according to the lessons learned from Beagle-2 and DS-2 failures.More impact tests for penetrators onto a lunar regolith analogue target will be undertaken before its launch.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) project started as a joint mission of the former ISAS (Institute of Space and Astronautical Science) and the former NASDA (National Space Development Agency: the two organizations were merged into JAXA in 2002) of Japan in 1998. The launch target is rescheduled for 2006 due to delay of completion of launch vehicle, H-IIA. The SELENE project is now under a sustained design phase. The flight model components were manufactured, and the interface tests between the bus-system and the mission instruments were completed by the end of March 2004. The functional checks and calibration for the flight model components are being carried out at present. From the beginning of 2005, the final assembly tests will start.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Space operation for China âs ï¬rst lunar exploration program,Chang âE will be provided by the S-band aerospace Telemetry,Tracking and Command (TT&C)network designed for China âs manned space program.This is undoubtedly a great challenge to the ground TT&C system.The largest antennas of China âs S-band aerospace TT&C network has an aperture of only 12 m.A series of technical measures have been taken into the designing of the spacecraft-ground TT&C system to ensure that such antennas can communicate with Chang âE-1 lunar probe 400,000 km away.These include installation of high-gain directional antennae and medium-gain omni-directional antennae for the probe,adding channel encoding to the downlink channel,using both high and low data rates for information transmission and upgrade and design of ground equipment terminals.Among them,the omni-directional antenna will operate in the earth-ground transfer orbit phase and the directional antenna will operate in the lunar orbit phase.These measures satisfy the spacecraft- ground link and program design requirements.</p>
					<p>To provide accurate navigation for the probe during its Earth âMoon ï¬ight and initial lunar orbiting ï¬ight,China âs VLBI system designed for astronomical observations,will also be used besides the ranging and range rate measurement capabilities of the S-band TT&C network.The purpose is to provide 100 m accuracy in position determination during lunar orbit.This paper describes the system design,technical challenges,solutions and capability evaluation of space operation for Chang âE-1.</p>

					<p>Optimal trajectory design of a probe for soft landing on the Moon from a lunar parking orbit by minimizing the fuel required is obtained.The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with the thrust direction being the control variable.Using the maximum principle of Pontryagin, the control variable is expressed as a function of co-state variables and the problem is converted into a two-point boundary value problem.The two-point boundary value problem is solved using an optimization technique,i.e.,controlled random search.The strategies such as</p>

				<title>Proterozoic intracontinental basin: The Vindhyan example</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Vindhyan Geology: Status and Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0003-0022</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Vindhyan basin is a classic example of Proterozoic intracontinental basin that developed in the central part of the Indian shield along with several other basins such as Cuddapah,Chattisgarh,etc.The strata are exposed in three major sectors:Son valley,Bundelkhand and Rajasthan. Substantially thick Vindhyan rocks have also been recognized under the Gangetic alluvium.The constituent stratigraphic units of the Vindhyan Supergroup are laterally correlatable and vertically stacked in similar fashion in individual sectors,but their stratigraphic and sedimentologic attributes vary from one sector to the other.The basin ï¬ll in the Son valley (around 3 km thick) exhibits an asymmetric cross-sectional geometry normal to the regional strike (ENE âWSW),with the thickest part occurring to the south,and is divisible into four groups:Semri,Kaimur,Rewa and Bhander,from bottom to top.The boundary between the Semri and Kaimur Groups is marked by a pronounced unconformity.The dominant lithologies include conglomerate,sandstone,shale, limestone as well as volcaniclastics.The Vindhyan strata de ï¬ne a broad,regional syncline trending ENE âWSW.The axis of the syncline is slightly curved (convex towards north)and plunges gently towards west.The average dip of the southern limb is greater than that of the northern limb rendering the axial plane to dip southerly.</p>
					<p>The Vindhyan succession can be divided into ï¬ve major sequences separated by unconformities. The unconformities are manifested in the ï¬eld by angular discordances and/or long-term subaerial exposure features.Unconformity surfaces are disposed in the succession de ï¬ning what is known as progressive unconformity,indicating contemporaneous tectonic activity during sedimentation. Individual sequences comprise of a spectrum of depositional systems that include alluvial fan, fan delta,braidplain,braidplain delta,eolian sandsheet,siliciclastic/carbonate tidal ï¬at,siliciclas- tic/carbonate shoreface,siliciclastic/carbonate shelf.The paleocurrents revealed by the Vindhyan strata are typically northerly suggesting that the evolving Satpura orogen served as the source for the Vindhyan sediments.However,the source for the clastics occurring within the Semri and the lower parts of the Kaimur and Rewa Groups in the Bundelkhand sector was perhaps the Bundelkhand Granite Gneiss,Bijawar and Gwalior Group of rocks as manifested by the southerly paleocurrent.</p>
					<p>The sequences of the Vindhyan succession are composed of several systems tracts.The different paleogeographic settings characterizing the systems tracts within individual sequences are as follows:</p>
					<p>Sequence 1:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST â alluvial fanâfan deltaâshelf (Deoland and Arangi Formations)</li>
						<li>HST â carbonate ramp (Kajrahat Formation)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Sequence 2:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST â shelf (Deonar Formation)</li>
						<li>FSST to TST â braid/fan deltaâshelf (Koldaha Formation)</li>
						<li>HST â tidal flatâshorefaceâshelf (Chorhat and Koldaha Formations)</li>
						<li>TST â shelf (Rampur Formation)</li>
						<li>TST â carbonate ramp (Rohtas Formation)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Sequence 3:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST â shorefaceâshelf (Sasaram Formation)</li>
						<li>FSST â shoreface (Ghaghar Formation)</li>
						<li>TST â shelf (Bijaygarh Formation)</li>
						<li>HST â braidplainâbraid deltaâshelf (Mageswar and Dhandraul Formations)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Sequence 4:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST â shelf (Panna Formation)</li>
						<li>FSST to TST â shoreface (Assan and Jhri Formations)</li>
						<li>HST â braidplainâbraid deltaâshelf (Jhiri, Drammondgunj and Govindgarh Formations)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Sequence 5:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST â tidal flat (Ganurgarh Formation)</li>

					<p>The Rewa Group of the Vindhyan Supergroup in the Son valley begins with a thick ($\sim 200m$) dominantly shaly,shelfal succession,occurring between the Dhandraul Formation of the Kaimur Group (ï¬uvial sandstone)below and Drammondganj Formation of the Rewa Group (marginal marine sandstone)above.Such a stratigraphic disposition indicates a sharp rise in relative sea level at the onset of Rewa sedimentation,inducing a shelfal depth to the Vindhyan basin.However,a number of wedge-shaped,sandstone/conglomerate bodies (maximum thickness 23.5 m)occur at multiple stratigraphic levels within the aforesaid deeper water shale succession,which appear to be of much shallow water origin representing regressive deposits.Though these bodies do not deï¬ne a single physically continuous unit,either vertically or laterally,they are still designated by a single term âAsan Sandstone âin the literature.On the other hand,the encasing shelfal shales are termed as Panna and Jhiri Shales,in accordance with their occurrence below or above the so-called âAsan Sandstone â.The present study reveals that in different sections spread over the Son valley,there are several discrete regressive wedges occurring vertically,and their depositional environment is also variable,ranging between braided ï¬uvial,shoreface fan and braid delta.The  features common to most of the regressive coarser clastic bodies are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>invariable presence of deeper water,shelfal shale below (Panna or Jhiri);</li>
						<li>the underlying shale at places shows signatures of emergence at the top;</li>
						<li>laterally impersistent,wedge-like geometry;and</li>
						<li>presence of granular transgressive lags at the top.These coarser clastic wedges record several episodes of regressive deposition during short-term falling stage or lowstand of relative sea level at the early phase of Rewa sedimentation.Each individual phase of regressive deposition was, however,followed by ï¬ooding and resumption of shelf mud deposition.</li>

				<page>0049-0060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper addresses macroscopic signatures of microbial mat-related structures within the 1.6 Ga-old Chorhat Sandstone of the Semri Group âthe basal stratigraphic unit of the Vindhyan succession in Son valley.The Chorhat Sandstone broadly represents a prograding succession of three depositional facies ranging from shallow shelf to coastal margin with aeolian sandsheet.The mat-mediated structures were generated because of plastic or brittle deformation of sand,turned cohesive and even thixotropic because of microbial mat growth.Mat growth also favoured abundant preservation of structures that usually have low preservation potential.</p>
					<p>Proliï¬c growth of microbial mat in the subtidal to intertidal zone of the Chorhat sea was facilitated due to lack of grazing and burrowing activities of organisms in the Precambrian.It further indicates low rate of sedimentation between the storms,as also attested by frequent superposition of storm-beds,even near the storm wave base.It also reduces erosion and that,in turn,would imply low sediment concentration in ï¬ows leading to development of bedforms that are likely to be smaller in size and isolated from each other in a single train in contrast to those that form in mat-free sands.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mesoproterozoic ($\sim 1600 Ma$ old) Salkhan Limestone (Semri Group)of the Vindhyan Supergroup, exposed in Rohtas district of Bihar,India,preserves an abundant and varied ancient microbial assemblage.These microfossils are recorded in three distinctly occurring cherts viz.,bedded chert, stromatolitic chert and cherty stromatolites.27 morphoforms belonging to 14 genera and 21 species have been recognized.Six unnamed forms are also described.</p>
					<p>The microbial assemblage,almost exclusively composed of the remnants of cyanobacteria,is dominated by entophysalidacean members and short trichomes and can be termed as âtypical Meso-proterozoic microbiotas â.The assemblage includes characteristic mat-forming scytonematacean and entophysalidacean cyanobacteria. \textit {Eoentophysalis} is the dominant organism in the assemblage. Ellipsoidal akinetes of nostocalean cyanobacteria \textit {(Archaeollipsoides )} and spherical unicells also occur;both are distinct from mat forming assemblage,allochthonous and possibly planktic.Co-occurrence of the microbiotas and precipitates is related to the depositional environment of the Mesoproterozoic tidal ï¬ats with high carbonate saturation.</p>

				<feature>Special issue: Vindhyan Geology: Status and Perspectives</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Vindhyan sedimentary succession in central India spans a wide time bracket from the Paleopro- terozoic to the Neoproterozoic period.Chronostratigraphic signiï¬cance of stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of the carbonate phase in Vindhyan sediments has been discussed in some recent studies.However,the subtle controls of facies variation,depositional setting and post-depositional diagenesis on stable isotope compositions are not yet clearly understood.The Vindhyan Super- group hosts four carbonate units,exhibiting a wide variability in depositional processes and paleogeography.A detailed facies-speciï¬c carbon and oxygen isotope study of the carbonate units was undertaken by us to investigate the effect of these processes and to identify the least altered isotope values.It is seen that both carbon and oxygen isotope compositions have been affected by early meteoric water diagenesis.The effect of diagenetic alteration is,however,more pronounced in case of oxygen isotopes than carbon isotopes.Stable isotope compositions remained insensitive to facies only when sediments accumulated in a shallow shelf setting without being exposed.Major alteration of original isotope ratios was observed in case of shallow marine carbonates,which became exposed to meteoric ï¬uids during early diagenetic stage.Duration of exposure possibly determined the magnitude of alteration and shift from the original values.Moreover,dolomitization is found to be accompanied by appreciable alteration of isotope compositions in some of the carbonates.The present study suggests that variations in sediment depositional settings,in particular the possibility of subaerial exposure,need to be considered while extracting chronostratigraphic signi ï¬cance from $\delta ^{13} C$ data.</p>

					<p>This paper presents results of high-resolution deep seismic reï¬ection proï¬ling of the Proterozoic Vindhyan basin of the Rajasthan area along the Chandli âBundi âKota âKunjer pro ï¬le.Seismic images have been used to estimate the thickness of Vindhyan strata as well as to understand the tectonic framework of the basin.The results are constrained by gravity,magnetic and magne-totelluric data.The study reveals gentle SE-dipping reï¬ection bands representing the Vindhyan strata.The seismic sections depict gradual thickening of the Vindhyan succession towards south-east from Bundi.The velocities of the upper and lower Vindhyans are identiï¬ed as 4.6 â4.8 km/s and 5.1 â5.3 km/s.The NW limit of the Vindhyan basin is demarcated by the Great Boundary Fault (GBF)that manifests as a 30 km wide NW dipping thrust fault extending to a depth of 30 km.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Vindhyan Supergroup of India is one of the largest and thickest sedimentary successions of the world.Deposited in an intra-cratonic basin,it is composed mostly of shallow marine deposits. It is believed to have recorded a substantial portion of Proterozoic time and therefore,likely to contain valuable information on the evolution of the atmosphere,climate,and life on our planet. It also contains some of the most disputed fossils of earliest animal life.Despite their importance, the absolute age of these rocks had remained unknown until recently.In this work I evaluate all the recent chronological information and discuss their implications.From the present ï¬ndings it appears that the issues surrounding the age of the Lower Vindhyans in the Son valley are now resolved,whereas problems with the age of the Upper Vindhyans and that with the stratigraphic correlations remain to be answered.</p>

				<title>Mesoproterozoic diamondiferous ultramafic pipes at Majhgawan and Hinota, Panna area, central India: Key to the nature of sub-continental lithospheric mantle beneath the Vindhyan basin</title>
				<feature>Special issue: Vindhyan Geology: Status and Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0161-0183</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amongst all the perceptible igneous manifestations (volcanic tuffs and agglomerates,minor rhyolitic ï¬ows and andesites,dolerite dykes and sills near the basin margins,etc.)in the Vindhyan basin,the two Mesoproterozoic diamondiferous ultramaï¬c pipes intruding the Kaimur Group of sediments at Majhgawan and Hinota in the Panna area are not only the most conspicuous but also well-known and have relatively deeper mantle origin.Hence,these pipes constitute the only yet available âdirect âmantle samples from this region and their petrology,geochemistry and iso-tope systematics are of profound signiï¬cance in understanding the nature of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle beneath the Vindhyan basin.Their emplacement age ($\sim 1100 Ma$)also constitutes the only reliable minimum age constrain on the Lower Vindhyan Group of rocks.The Majhgawan and Hinota pipes share the petrological,geochemical and isotope characteristics of kimberlite,orangeite (Group II kimberlite)and lamproite and hence are recognised as belonging to a âtransitional kimberlite âorangeite âlamproite ârock type.The name \textit {majhagwanite} has been proposed by this author to distinguish them from other primary diamond source rocks.The parent magma of the Majhgawan and Hinota pipes is envisaged to have been derived by very small (&mt; 1%)degrees of partial melting of a phlogopite-garnet lherzolite source (rich in titanium and barium)that has been previously subjected to an episode of initial depletion (extensive melting during continent formation)and subsequent metasomatism (enrichment).There is absence of any subduction-related characteristics,such as large negative anomalies at Ta and Nb,and therefore, the source enrichment (metasomatism)of both these pipes is attributed to the volatile-and K-rich, extremely low-viscosity melts that leak continuously to semi-continuously from the asthenosphere and accumulate in the overlying lithosphere.Lithospheric/crustal extension,rather than decompression melting induced by a mantle plume,is favoured as the cause of melting of the source regions of Majhgawan and Hinota pipes.This paper is a review of the critical evaluation of the published work on these pipes based on contemporary knowledge derived from similar occurrences elsewhere.</p>

				<title>Transitions in the surface energy balance during the life cycle of a monsoon season</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0185-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this observational/diagnostic study,we illustrate the time history of some important parameters of the surface energy balance during the life cycle of a single monsoon season.This chronology of the surface energy balance portrays the differential equilibrium state from the preonset phase to the withdrawal phase.This includes an analysis of the time history of base variables such as soil moisture,ground temperature,cloud cover,precipitation and humidity.This is followed by an analysis of the components of the surface energy balance where we note subtle changes in the overall balances as we proceed from one epoch of the monsoon to the next.Of interest here is the transition sequence:preonset,onset,break,revival,break,revival and withdrawal during the year 2001.Computations are all illustrated for a box over central India where the coastal effects were small,data coverage was not sparse and where the semi-arid land mass changes drastically to a lush green area.This region exhibited large changes in the components of surface energy balance.The principal results pertain to what balances the difference among the incoming short wave radiation (at the earth âs surface)and the long wave radiation exhibited by the ground.That difference is balanced by a dominant sensible heat ï¬ux and the reï¬ected short wave radiation in the preonset stage.A sudden change in the Bowen ratio going from &lt; 1to &mt; 1 is noted soon after the onset of monsoon.Thereafter the latent heat ï¬ux from the land surface takes an important role and the sensible heat ï¬ux acquires a diminishing role.We also examine the subtle changes that occur in the components of surface energy balance between the break and the active phases.The break phases are seen to be quite different from the preonset phases.This study is aimed to illustrate the major importance of moisture and clouds in the radiative transfer computations that are central to the surface energy balance during each epoch.These sensitivities (of moisture and clouds)have major consequences for weather and climate forecasts.</p>

				<title>Spatio-temporal variability of summer monsoon rainfall over Orissa in relation to low pressure systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0203-0218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The summer monsoon rainfall over Orissa occurs mostly due to low pressure systems (LPS)developing over the Bay of Bengal and moving along the monsoon trough.A study is hence undertaken to ï¬nd out characteristic features of the relationship between LPS over different regions and rainfall over Orissa during the summer monsoon season (June--September).For this purpose,rainfall and rainy days over 31 selected stations in Orissa and LPS days over Orissa and adjoining land and sea regions during different monsoon months and the season as a whole over a period of 20 years (1980--1999)are analysed.The principal objective of this study is to ï¬nd out the role of LPS on spatial and temporal variability of summer monsoon rainfall over Orissa.</p>
					<p>The rainfall has been signiï¬cantly less than normal over most parts of Orissa except the eastern side of Eastern Ghats during July and hence during the season as a whole due to a signiï¬cantly less number of LPS days over northwest Bay in July over the period of 1980--1999.The seasonal rainfall shows higher interannual variation (increase in coefficient of variation by about 5%)during 1980--1999 than that during 1901--1990 over most parts of Orissa except northeast Orissa.Most parts of Orissa,especially the region extending from central part of coastal Orissa to western Orissa (central zone)and western side of the Eastern Ghats get more seasonal monsoon rainfall with the development and persistence of LPS over northwest Bay and their subsequent movement and persistence over Orissa.The north Orissa adjoining central zone also gets more seasonal rainfall with development and persistence of LPS over northwest Bay.While the seasonal rainfall over the western side of the Eastern Ghats is adversely affected due to increase in LPS days over west central Bay,Jharkhand and Bangladesh,that over the eastern side of the Eastern Ghats is adversely affected due to increase in LPS days over all the regions to the north of Orissa.There are signiï¬cant decreasing trends in rainfall and number of rainy days over some parts of southwest Orissa during June and decreasing trends in rainy days over some parts of north interior Orissa and central part of coastal Orissa during July over the period of 1980--1999.</p>

					<p>Hydrogeological systems are earth systems inï¬uenced by water.Their behaviors are governed by interacting processes,including ï¬ow of ï¬uids,deformation of porous materials,chemical reactions, and transport of matter and energy.Here,coupling among three of these processes is considered: ï¬ow of water,heat,and deformation,each of which is represented by a diffusion-type of partial differential equation.One side of the diffusion-type equation relates to motion of matter or energy, while the other relates to temporal changes of state variables at a given location.The coupling arises from processes that govern motion as well as those that relate to change of state.In this work, attention is devoted to coupling arising from changes in state.Partial derivatives of equations of state constitute the capacitance terms of diffusion-type equations.Of the many partial derivatives that are mathematically possible in physical systems characterized by several variables,only a few are physically signi ï¬cant.Because the state variables are related to each other through an equation of state,the partial derivatives must collectively satisfy a closure criterion.This framework offers a systematic way of developing the coupled set of equations that govern hydrogeological systems involving the ï¬ow of water,heat,and deformation.Such systems are described in terms of four variables,and the associated partial derivatives.The physical import of these derivatives are discussed,followed by a description of partial derivatives that are of practical interest.These partial derivatives are then used as the basis to develop a set of coupled equations.A brief discussion is presented on coupled equations from a perspective of energy optimization.</p>

				<title>Impact of sea breeze on wind-seas off Goa, west coast of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0229-0234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>After withdrawal of the Indian Summer Monsoon and until onset of the next monsoon,i.e.,roughly during November--May,winds in the coastal regions of India are dominated by sea breeze.It has an impact on the daily cycle of the sea state near the coast.The impact is quite signiï¬cant when large scale winds are weak.During one such event,1 â15 April 1997,a Datawell directional waverider buoy was deployed in 23 m water depth off Goa,west coast of India.Twenty-minute averaged spectra,collected once every three hours,show that the spectrum of sea-breeze-related âwind-seas â peaked at $0.23 \pm 0.05 Hz$. These wind-seas were well separated from swells of frequencies less than 0.15 Hz.The TMA spectrum (Bouws \textit {et al} 1985) matched the observed seas spectra very well when the sea-breeze was active and the fetch corresponding to equilibrium spectrum was found to be $77 \pm 43$ km during such occasions. We emphasize on the diurnal cycle of sea-breeze-related sea off the coast of Goa and write an equation for the energy of the seas as a function of the local wind.</p>

				<title>Bedrock gorges in the central mainland Kachchh: Implications for landscape evolution</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0249-0256</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kachchh possesses a fault-controlled ï¬rst-order topography and several geomorphic features indicative of active tectonics.Though coseismic neotectonic activity is believed to be the major factor in the evolution of the landscape,detailed documentation and analysis of vital landscape features like drainage characteristics,bedrock gorges and terraces are lacking.The present study is a site-speci ï¬c documentation of gorges developed in the central part of the mainland Kachchh.We analyzed and interpreted four gorges occurring on either side of Katrol Hill Fault (KHF).The Khari river gorge is endowed with six levels of bedrock terraces,some of which are studded with large potholes and ï¬utings.Since no active development of potholes is observed along the rivers in the present day hyper-arid conditions,we infer an obvious linkage of gorges to the humid phases,which provided high energy runoff for the formation of gorges and distinct bedrock terraces and associated erosional features.Development of gorges within the miliolites and incision in the ï¬uvial deposits to the south of the KHF indicates that the gorges were formed during Early Holocene.However,ubi-quitous occurrence of gorges along the streams to the south of KHF,the uniformly $N40^\circ E$ trend of the gorges,their close association with transverse faults and the short length of the exceptionally well developed Khari river gorge in the low-relief rocky plain to the north of KHF suggests an important role of neotectonic movements.</p>

				<title>Fast computation of Hankel Transform using orthonormal exponential approximation of complex kernel function</title>

				<page>0267-0276</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The computation of electromagnetic (EM)ï¬elds,for 1-D layered earth model,requires evaluation of Hankel Transform (HT)of the EM kernel function.The digital ï¬ltering is the most widely used technique to evaluate HT integrals.However,it has some obvious shortcomings.We present an alternative scheme,based on an orthonormal exponential approximation of the kernel function, for evaluating HT integrals.This approximation of the kernel function was chosen because the analytical solution of HT of an exponential function is readily available in literature.This expansion reduces the integral to a simple algebraic sum.The implementation of such a scheme requires that the weights and the exponents of the exponential function be estimated.The exponents were estimated through a guided search algorithm while the weights were obtained using Marquardt matrix inversion method.The algorithm was tested on analytical HT pairs available in literature. The results are compared with those obtained using the digital ï¬ltering technique with Anderson ï¬lters.The ï¬eld curves for four types (A-,K-,H-and Q-type)of 3-layer earth models are generated using the present scheme and compared with the corresponding curves obtained using the Anderson scheme.It is concluded that the present scheme is more accurate than the Anderson scheme.</p>

				<title>Modeling of groundwater flow for Mujib aquifer, Jordan</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0289-0297</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Jordan is an arid country with very limited water resources.Groundwater is the main source for its water supply.Mujib aquifer is located in the central part of Jordan and is a major source of drinking water for Amman,Madaba and Karak cities.High abstraction rates from Mujib aquifer during the previous years lead to a major decline in water levels and deterioration in groundwater quality. Therefore,proper groundwater management of Mujib aquifer is necessary;and groundwater ï¬ow modeling is essential for proper management.For this purpose,Mod ï¬ow was used to build a groundwater ï¬ow model to simulate the behavior of the ï¬ow system under different stresses.The model was calibrated for steady state condition by matching observed and simulated initial head counter lines.Drawdown data for the period 1985--1995 were used to calibrate the transient model by matching simulated drawdown with the observed one.Then,the transient model was validated by using drawdown data for the period 1996--2002.The results of the calibrated model showed that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the B2/A7 aquifer ranges between 0.001 and 40 m/d. Calibrated speci ï¬c yield ranges from 0.0001 to 0.15.The water balance for the steady state condition of Mujib aquifer indicated that the total annual direct recharge is $20.4 \times 10^{6} m^3$ ,the total annual in ï¬ow is $13.0 \times 10^{6} m^{3}$ ,springs discharge is $15.3 \times 10^{6} m^{3}$ ,and total annual out ï¬ow is $18.7 \times 10^{6} m^{3}$. Different scenarios were considered to predict aquifer system response under different conditions.  The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the model is highly sensitive to horizontal hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy and with lower level to the recharge rates.Also the model is sensitive to speciï¬c yield.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Intense rainfall often leads to ï¬oods and landslides in the Himalayan region even with rainfall amounts that are considered comparatively moderate over the plains;for example,âcloudbursts â, which are devastating convective phenomena producing sudden high-intensity rainfall ($\sim 10 cm$ per hour)over a small area.Early prediction and warning of such severe local weather systems is crucial to mitigate societal impact arising from the accompanying ï¬ash ï¬oods.We examine a cloudburst event in the Himalayan region at Shillagarh village in the early hours of 16 July 2003.The storm lasted for less than half an hour, followed by ï¬ash ï¬oods that affected hundreds of people.We examine the ï¬delity of MM5 con ï¬gured with multiple-nested domains (81,27,9 and 3 km grid-resolution)for predicting a cloudburst event with attention to horizontal resolution and the cloud microphysics parameterization.The MM5 model predicts the rainfall amount 24 hours in advance. However,the location of the cloudburst is displaced by tens of kilometers.</p>

				<page>0315-0332</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An operational atmospheric dispersion prediction system is implemented on a cluster supercomputer for Online Emergency Response at the Kalpakkam nuclear site.This numerical system constitutes a parallel version of a nested grid meso-scale meteorological model MM5 coupled to a random walk particle dispersion model FLEXPART.The system provides 48-hour forecast of the local weather and radioactive plume dispersion due to hypothetical airborne releases in a range of 100 km around the site.The parallel code was implemented on different cluster con ï¬gurations like distributed and shared memory systems.A 16-node dual Xeon distributed memory gigabit ethernet cluster has been found sufficient for operational applications.The runtime of a triple nested domain MM5 is about 4 h for a 24 h forecast.The system had been operated continuously for a few months and results were ported on the IMSc home page.</p>
					<p>Initial and periodic boundary condition data for MM5 are provided by NCMRWF,New Delhi. An alternative source is found to be NCEP,USA.These two sources provide the input data to the operational models at different spatial and temporal resolutions using different assimilation methods.A comparative study on the results of forecast is presented using these two data sources for present operational use.Improvement is noticed in rainfall forecasts that used NCEP data, probably because of its high spatial and temporal resolution.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Daily zenith scattered light intensity observations were carried out in the morning twilight hours using home-made UV-visible spectrometer over the tropical station Pune ($18^\circ 31^{,}, 73^\circ 51^{,}$ )for the years 2000--2003.These observations are obtained in the spectral range 462--498 nm for the solar zenith angles (SZAs)varying from $87^\circ to 91.5^\circ $.An algorithm has been developed to retrieve vertical proï¬les of ozone ($O_3$) and nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$) from ground-based measurements using the Chahine iteration method.This retrieval method has been checked using measured and recalculated slant column densities (SCDs)and they are found to be well matching. $O_3$ and $NO_2$ vertical proï¬les have been retrieved using a set of their air mass factors (AMFs)and SCDs measured over a range of $87--91.5^\circ $ SZA during the morning.The vertical proï¬les obtained by this method are compared with Umkehr proï¬les and ozonesondes and they are found to be in good agreement.The bulk of the column density is found near layer 20--25 km.Daily total column densities (TCDs)of $O_3$ and $NO_2$ along with their stratospheric and tropospheric counterparts are derived using their vertical proï¬les for the period 2000--2003.The total column,stratospheric column and tropospheric column amounts of both trace gases are found to be maximum in summer and minimum in the winter season.Increasing trend is found in column density of $NO_2$ in stratospheric,tropospheric and surface layers,but no trend is observed in $O_3$ columns for above layers during the period 2000--2003.</p>

					<p>The local and teleconnective association between Northeast Monsoon Rainfall (NEMR)over Tamil Nadu and global Surface Temperature Anomalies (STA)is examined using the monthly grid-ded STA data for the period 1901--2004.Various geographical regions which have signiï¬cant tele-connective signals associated with NEMR are identi ï¬ed.During excess (deï¬cient)NEMR years,it is observed that the meridional gradient in surface air temperature anomalies between Europe and north Africa,in the month of September is directed from the subtropics (higher latitudes)to higher latitudes (subtropics).It is also observed that North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)during September in ï¬uences the surface air temperature distribution over north Africa and Europe.Also,the NAO index in January shows signiï¬cant inverse relationship with NEMR since recent times.The central and eastern equatorial Paciï¬c oceanic regions have signi ï¬cant and consistent positive correlation with NEMR while the western equatorial region has signiï¬cant negative correlation with NEMR. A zonal temperature anomaly gradient index (ZTAGI)de ï¬ned between eastern equatorial Paciï¬c and western equatorial Paciï¬c shows stable signiï¬cant inverse relationship with NEMR.</p>

				<title>Amino sugars in suspended particulate matter from the Bay of Bengal during the summer monsoon of 2001</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0363-0370</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amino sugars (AS)are important constituents of organic matter.However,very little is known about their cycling in marine waters.In this research,we assessed the distribution and cycling of these compounds in waters of the Bay of Bengal.For this purpose,samples of suspended particulate matter (SPM)were collected from 8 depths (surface to 1000 m)at 6 locations during the 166th cruise of the ORV Sagar Kanya in the Bay of Bengal in July/August 2001.The SPM samples were analysed for particulate organic carbon (POC),particulate nitrogen (PN)and AS concentrations and composition.The AS varied between 0.4 and 17.5 nmol/l.Concentrations were high in the surface waters and generally decreased with increasing depth.AS concentration decreased from the south to north.AS accounted for 0.01 to 0.71%and 0.05 to 2.37%of POC and PN,respectively. Rapid decrease in AS-C%and AS-N%with depth indicates that these compounds were preferentially degraded relative to bulk POC and PN.The composition of AS suggests that glucosamine (GLU-N)and galactosamine (GAL-N)were present in the surface SPM samples,and their abundance decreased from surface downwards.Relatively,low values of GLU-N/GAL-N ratio indicate that the organic matter was mostly derived from the detritus of micro-organisms.Our data suggest that chitin,a polymer of the glucosamine produced by many marine organisms was not the major source of AS in the Bay.Rapid cycling of these compounds indicates their importance in the cycling of nitrogen in marine waters.</p>

				<page>0371-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>On 26th December 2004,the world witnessed the devastating power of tsunami, affecting many countries,bordering the Indian Ocean region.This has caused signiï¬cant changes in the shallow and intertidal regions of the Indian coast,especially the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry.The baseline data on biomass availability and distribution of benthic intertidal seaweed species were collected immediately after this catastrophic event by spot surveying 11 selected localities of the above-mentioned regions.In all,45 species belonging to 31 genera were recorded during the present survey,the maximum number of seaweed species were recorded at Thirumullavarum,Kerala with the minimum at Car Nicobar,Andaman and Nicobar Islands. A very different trend was observed in the case of biomass availability at some locations which was due to the inï¬uence of habitat suitability over the tsunami damage.The details of this study have been provided in the present communication.</p>

				<title>Climate induced changes in the circulation and dispersal patterns of the fluvial sources during late Quaternary in the middle Bengal Fan</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0379-0386</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>From a transact along $15^\circ $N latitude in the middle Bengal Fan,temporal and spatial variations in the granulometric parameters and clay minerals in $^{14}C$ dated box cores from the eastern,the central and the western regions were studied to determine climate induced changes in the hydrography. Clay assemblages have spatial and temporal changes and are markedly different in the eastern and the western bay.From a high abundance of the clay smectite,which has its major source in the Deccan Basalt in peninsular India,it is inferred that the western bay is predominantly a depocenter of âpeninsular sources â.The eastern and the central regions of the bay,however, mostly receive sediments of the âHimalayan source â.Related to unstable climate,the reported dominant illite âchlorite (I +C)assemblage in the eastern region of the bay (I +C &lt; 60%smectite &mt; 15%),between 18 and 12.6 ka BP,points to a predominant supply from the Himalayan sources through equatorwards dispersal by the winter hydrography.Higher smectite,and reduced clays of the Himalayan sources (smectite $lt; 25%;I +C &lt; 45%)are reported also after 12.5 ka BP from the eastern bay.These are interpreted as evidences of an intensiï¬ed SW monsoon and associated change in the dispersal pattern by stronger summer monsoon hydrography which supports across bay dispersal by anticyclonic gyre.The inï¬uence of climate on hydrographic changes is consistent during the short events of arid climate (weak NE monsoon)in Holocene in core 31/1(western bay), in which the enhanced contents of the clays of the Himalayan sources are observed (smectite $mt; 40% I +C &lt; 50%).These ï¬ndings have implications for climate regulated in ï¬uence of ï¬uvial processes over the areas,hitherto,considered unaffected by the Indian peninsular ï¬uvial sources.</p>

				<title>Structure of Charnockitic basement in a part of the KrishnaâGodavari basin, Andhra Pradesh</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0387-0393</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A regional magnetic survey was carried out over an area of $8000 km^2$ in Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh,India,which is covered by the rocks of Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) \textit {viz.,} the Khondalitic series and Charnockites in the northern half and Permian to Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments in the southern half,and forms a part of the Krishna âGodavari (K âG)basin. The survey brought out a strong NE âSW trending anomaly in the area covered by the rocks of Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB),and a mild ENE âWSW trending anomaly in the area covered by the sediments of the Krishna âGodavari (K âG)basin.The NE âSW trending anomaly in the northern half could be attributed to the exposed/near surface Charnockite basement that has come closer to the surface as a result of Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt  (EGMB)tectonics.Explanation of  the mild ENE âWSW trending anomaly over the sediments of the Krishna âGodavari (K âG)basin required a faulted magnetic basement at depth downthrown towards the south.It is therefore concluded that the Charnockitic basement together with the Khondalite group of rocks which are folded and faulted during the different phases of tectonics of Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) extend into the Krishna âGodavari (K âG)basin and further,were involved in faulting during the phases of formation and sedimentation in the Krishna âGodavari (K âG)basin.</p>

				<title>Geomorphic expression of late Quaternary sea level changes along the southern Saurashtra coast, western India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0395-0402</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geomorphic expression of land--sea interaction is preserved in the form of abandoned cliffs, marine terraces,shore platforms and marine notches along the southern Saurashtra coast. These features have been used to ascertain the magnitude of sea level changes during late Quaternary.Notch morphology and associated biological encrustation have been used to estimate the magnitude and duration of palaeo-sea strands.Marine notches and other erosive features occurring between 12 and 15 m above the present Biological Mean Sea Level (BMSL) are attributed to the last interglacial corresponding to the Marine Isotopic Stage 5 (MIS-5). However,6 to 9 m upliftment of the coastal fringe is attributed to this sea level.The second major high sea strand was identiï¬ed during the mid-Holocene when the sea rose 2 m above the present level.Notches corresponding to this high sea level are recorded 4 to 5 m above the present BMSL.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Surface seawater samples were collected over a period of 27 months at a shallow water station in Dona Paula bay from 1998--2000.The samples were analyzed to assess the seasonal variations, inter-annual variability and the contributions of:</p>

					</ul>
					<p>A distinct inter-annual variability was observed with an increase in the bacterial abundance,chlorophyll \textit {a} (Chl \textit {a} ,TEP and Sal-PCHO and their greater contribution to particulate organic carbon during May 1998--1999 than in June 1999--July 2000.Overall,there was no statistically signiï¬cant correlation of TEP with phytoplankton biomass (Chl \textit {a} ,Sal-PCHO,CPCHO and hydrodynamic conditions.A weak inverse correlation was observed between TEP and TBA (\textit {r} = â0.397; \textit {p} &mt; 0.05) but the role of TEP as a C-source for bacteria was not evident.Both Sal-PCHO and CPCHO appeared to be two distinct forms of carbohydrates.Unlike CPCHO,Sal-PCHO concentrations showed a positive trend with Chl \textit {a} and signiï¬cant linear correlation with bacterial abundance (\textit {r} =0.44, \textit {p} &mt; 0.007, \textit {n}= 48),indicating that Sal-PCHO as carbon source might have supported bacterioplankton abundance.The mean %TEP-C contribution to the annual average organic carbon for 1998--2000 was $6.9% \pm 5.8%$, next only to phytoplankton-C ($33.1 \pm 22.1%$) and greater than bacterial-C ($4.6% \pm 4.6%$)or carbohydrate-C (&mt; 3.8%).Despite its greater contribution to the organic carbon pool,the contribution of TEP-C to the benthic carbon demand and its fate in the study area could not be ascertained in this study.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sediment trap samples collected from a depth of 1018 m in the Central Arabian Sea Trap (CAST) at $14^\circ 28.2^{,}N, 64^\circ 35.8^{,}E$ were analyzed for temporal variation of coccolithophore ï¬uxes from October 1993 to August 1994.Out of the twenty species of coccolithophores encountered, \tetit {Gephyrocapsa oceanica,Emiliania huxleyi,Umbilicosphaera sibogae} and \textit {Umbellosphaera irregularis} were the most abundant.The total coccolithophore ï¬uxes ranged from $28.5 \times 10^{6} m^{â2} d^{â1}$ to $50.3 \times 10^{6} m^{â2} d^{â1}$ showing seasonality with higher ï¬uxes during the northeast (NE)monsoon and lower ï¬uxes during the spring intermonsoon.The higher ï¬uxes were attributed to the enhancement of primary production in the central Arabian Sea due to southward extent of nutrients from the northeast Arabian Sea by the prevailing surface currents.Similarly,the occurrences of relatively lower coc-colithophore ï¬uxes during the spring intermonsoon and southwest (SW)monsoon were attributed to the low nutrients in the warm,shallow surface mixed layer and downwelling to the south of Findlater Jet respectively in the central Arabian Sea.Some of the coccolithophore species such as \textit {E.huxleyi,G.oceanica,Calcidiscus leptoporus} and \textit {Umbellosphaera tenuis} showed signs of dissolution.</p>

					<p>Data on ocean color chlorophyll \textit {a} (Chl \textit {a} )obtained using Sea-viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS),sea surface temperature (SST)by Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR),and sea surface height (SSH)by TOPEX/POSEIDON were analyzed to examine the inï¬uence of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)on the physical and biogeochemical processes with special reference to phytoplankton primary production and air âsea ï¬uxes of carbon dioxide in the Arabian Sea.Positive SST anomalies (SSTA)were found in the Arabian Sea (0.4 to $1.8^\circ C$) with higher values in the southwestern Arabian Sea that decreased towards north.The SSH anomalies (SSHA)and turbulent kinetic energy anomalies (TKEA)suggest decreased mixing during the IOD compared to the normal period.Chlorophyll \textit {a} displayed signiï¬cant negative correlations with SSTA and SSHA in the Arabian Sea.Consistently, Chl \textit {a} showed negative anomalies (low Chl \textit {a} )during the IOD period which could be due to reduced inputs of nutrients.The photic zone integrated primary production decreased by 30%during the IOD period compared to the normal whereas $pCO_2$ levels were higher (by $10--20 \mu atm$). However,sea to air ï¬uxes were lower by 10% during the IOD period due to prevailing weaker winds.Primary production seems to be the key process controlling the surface $pCO_2$ levels in the Arabian Sea.In future,the in ï¬uence of IOD on ecosystem structure,export production and bacterial respiration rates are to be probed through \textit {in situ} time-series observations.</p>

				<title>Spatial and temporal distribution of methane in an extensive shallow estuary, south India</title>
				<feature>Special Section on: Material exchanges at marine boundaries and surface ocean processes: Forcings and feedbacks</feature>
				<page>0451-0460</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sedimentary methane ($CH_4$) ï¬uxes and oxidation rates were determined over the wet and dry seasons (four measurement campaigns)in Pulicat lake,an extensive shallow estuary in south India. Dissolved $CH_4$ concentrations were measured at 52 locations in December 2000.The annual mean net $CH_4$ ï¬ux from Pulicat lake sediments was $3.7 \times 10^{9} g yr^{â1}$ based on static chamber measurements.A further $1.7 \times 10^{9} g yr^{â1}$ was estimated to be oxidized at the sediment--water interface. The mean dissolved concentration of $CH_4$ was 242 nmol $l^{â1}$ (ranging between 94 and 501 nmol $l^{â1}$ ) and the spatial distribution could be explained by tidal dynamics and freshwater input.Sea âair exchange estimates using models,account only for $\sim 13%(0.5 \times 10^{9} g yr^{â1}$ )of the total $CH_4$ produced in sediments, whereas ebullition appeared to be the major route for loss to the atmosphere ($\sim 63%$ of the net sediment ï¬ux).We estimated the total atmospheric source of $CH_4$ from Pulicat lake to be 0.5 to $4.0 \times 10^{9} g yr^{â1}$.</p>

					<p>Particulate ï¬uxes of aluminium,iron,magnesium and titanium were measured using six time- series sediment traps deployed in the eastern,central and western Arabian Sea.Annual Al ï¬uxes at shallow and deep trap depths were 0.47 and $0.46 g m^{â2}$ in the western Arabian Sea,and 0.33 and $0.47 g m^{â2}$ in the eastern Arabian Sea.There is a difference of about $0.9 --1.8g m^{â2} y^{â1}$ in the lithogenic ï¬uxes determined analytically (residue remaining after leaching out all biogenic particles) and estimated from the Al ï¬uxes in the western Arabian Sea.This arises due to higher ï¬uxes of Mg (as dolomite)in the western Arabian Sea (6--11 times higher than the eastern Arabian Sea). The estimated dolomite ï¬uxes at the western Arabian Sea site range from 0.9 to $1.35 g m^{â2} y^{â1}$ . Fe ï¬uxes in the Arabian Sea were less than that of the reported atmospheric ï¬uxes without any evidence for the presence of labile fraction/excess of Fe in the settling particles.More than 75% of Al,Fe,Ti and Mg ï¬uxes occurred during the southwest (SW)monsoon in the western Arabian Sea.In the eastern Arabian Sea,peak Al,Fe,Mg and Ti ï¬uxes were recorded during both the northeast (NE)and SW monsoons.During the SW monsoon,there exists a time lag of around one month between the increases in lithogenic and dolomite ï¬uxes.Total lithogenic ï¬uxes increase when the southern branch of dust bearing northwesterlies is dragged by the SW monsoon winds to the trap locations.However,the dolomite ï¬uxes increase only when the northern branch of the northwesterlies (which carries a huge amount of dolomite accounting 60%of the total dust load) is dragged,from further north,by SW monsoon winds.The potential for the use of Mg/Fe ratio as a paleo-monsoonal proxy is examined.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Characteristics of trace gases ($O_{3}, CO, CO_{2}, CH_{4}$ and $N_{2}O$ and aerosols (particle size of 2.5 micron) were studied over the Arabian Sea,equatorial Indian Ocean and southwest part of the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon transition period (October--November,2004).Flow of pollutants is expected from south and southeast Asia during the monsoonal transition period due to the patterns of wind ï¬ow which are different from the monsoon period.This is the ï¬rst detailed report on aerosols and trace gases during the sampled period as the earlier Bay of Bengal Experiment (BOBMEX), Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX)and Indian Ocean Experiments (INDOEX)were during monsoon seasons.The signiï¬cant observations during the transition period include:(i)low ozone concentration of the order of 5 ppbv around the equator,(ii)high concentrations of $CO_{2}, CH_{4}$ and $N_{2}O$ and (iii)variations in PM2.5 of $5--20 \mu g/ m^{3}$.</p>

				<title>Discriminating four tectonic settings: Five new geochemical diagrams for basic and ultrabasic volcanic rocks based on logâratio transformation of major-element data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0485-0528</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present ï¬ve new discriminant function diagrams based on an extensive database representative of basic and ultrabasic rocks from four tectonic settings of island arc, continental rift, ocean-island, and mid-ocean ridge. These diagrams were obtained after log_{e}-transformation of concentration ratios of major-elements â a technique recommended for a correct statistical treatment of compositional data. Higher % success rates (overall values from $\sim 83 $to 97%) were obtained for proposing these new diagrams as compared to those ($\sim 82$ to 94%) obtained from the discriminant analysis of the raw major-element concentration data (i.e., without the log_{e}-transformation and without taking ratios of the compositional data, but using exactly the same database to provide an unbiased comparison), suggesting that such a data transformation constitutes a statistically correct and recommended technique. The new diagrams also resulted in less mis-classiï¬cation of basic and ultrabasic rocks from known tectonic settings than the diagrams obtained from the raw data. The use of these highly successful new discriminant function diagrams is illustrated using Miocene to Recent basic and ultrabasic rocks from three areas of Mexico with complex or controversial tectonic settings (Mexican Volcanic Belt, Los Tuxtlas volcanic ï¬eld, and Eastern Alkaline Province), as well as older rocks from three areas (Deccan, Malani, and Bastar) of India. Additionally, the major-element data from two âknownâ continental arc settings are used to show that they are similar to those from the island arc setting. Continental rift setting is inferred for all Mexican cases and for one cratonic area of India (Malani) and an IAB setting for the Bastar craton. The Deccan ï¬ood basalt province of India is used to warn against an indiscriminate use of those discrimination diagrams that do not explicitly include the likely setting of the area under evaluation. An Excel template is also provided for an easy application of these new diagrams for discriminating the four settings considered in this work.</p>

				<title>High resolution numerical weather prediction over the Indian subcontinent</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0529-0555</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the Florida State University Global Spectral Model (FSUGSM), in association with a high-resolution nested regional spectral model (FSUNRSM), is used for short-range weather forecasts over the Indian domain. Three-day forecasts for each day of August 1998 were performed using different versions of the FSUGSM and FSUNRSM and were compared with the observed ï¬elds (analysis) obtained from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The impact of physical initialization (a procedure that assimilates observed rain rates into the model atmosphere through a set of reverse algorithms) on rainfall forecasts was examined in detail. A very high nowcasting skill for precipitation is obtained through the use of high-resolution physical initialization applied at the regional model level. Higher skills in wind and precipitation forecasts over the Indian summer monsoon region are achieved using this version of the regional model with physical initialization.</p>
					<p>A relatively new concept, called the âmultimodel/multianalysis superensembleâ is described in this paper and is applied for the wind and precipitation forecasts over the Indian subcontinent. Large improvement in forecast skills of wind at 850 hPa level over the Indian subcontinent is shown possible through the use of the multimodel superensemble. The multianalysis superensemble approach that uses the latest satellite data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) has shown signiï¬cant improvement in the skills of precipitation forecasts over the Indian monsoon region.</p>

				<title>A numerical study of sea breeze circulation observed at a tropical site Kalpakkam on the east coast of India, under different synoptic flow situations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0557-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simulation study of the sea breeze circulation and thermal internal boundary layer (TIBL) characteristics has been carried out at the tropical site Kalpakkam on the east coast of India, for operational atmospheric dispersion prediction. The community based PSU/NCAR MM5 Mesoscale meteorological model is used for the study. Three cases on typical days in summer (24 May 2003), southwest (SW) monsoon (1 July 2001) winter season (2 February 2003) with different largescale  flow pattern are studied. The MM5 model is used with 3 nested domains with horizontal grid resolutions 18 km, 6 km and 2 km and 26 vertical levels. The model is integrated for 24 hours in the above cases with initial and boundary conditions taken from NCEP-FNL analyses data. Observations of 10 meteorological stations and coastal boundary layer experiments conducted at Kalpakkam are used for comparison and validation of the simulation. The characteristics of simulated sea breeze and TIBL at Kalpakkam are seen to vary in the above cases according to the prevailing large-scale winds and surface fluxes. The sea breeze circulation is seen to develop early with larger strength and inland propagation in the summer case under the influence of moderate synoptic wind and strong heating conditions than in the SW monsoon and winter cases. The horizontal and vertical extents of TIBL are found to be larger in the summer case than in other cases. Although model parameters agree in general with observations, all the fine features are not clearly captured and some slowness in model sea breeze development is also seen. The results indicate the need to improve i) the initial conditions by assimilation of available surface/upper air observations to reduce model bias and ii) surface net radiation parameterisation. The model could predict the essential features of the local circulation and further improvement is expected with better initial condition data and incorporation of more realistic surface data.</p>

				<title>Summer monsoon intraseasonal oscillation over eastern Arabian Sea â as revealed by TRMM microwave imager products</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0575-0586</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The time evolution of atmospheric parameters on intraseasonal time scale in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS) is studied during the summer monsoon seasons of 1998â2003 using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI) data. This is done using the spectral and wavelet analysis. Analysis shows that over EAS, total precipitable water vapour (TWV) and sea surface wind speed (SWS) have a periodicity of 8â15 days, 15â30 days and 30â60 days during the monsoon season. Signiï¬cant power is seen in the 8â15-day time scale in TWV during onset and retreat of the summer monsoon. Analysis indicates that the timings of the intensiï¬cation of 8â15, 15â30, and 30â60 days oscillations have a profound effect on the evolution of the daily rainfall over west coast of India. The positive and negative phases of these oscillations are directly related to the active and dry spells of rainfall along the west coast of India. The spectral analysis shows interannual variation of TWV and SWS. Heavy rainfall events generally occur over the west coast of India when positive phases of both 30â60 days and 15â30 days modes of TWV and SWS are simultaneously present.</p>

				<title>Marine boundary layer characteristics during a cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0587-0599</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the period 12â16 June 1996 a tropical cyclonic storm formed over the southwest Bay of Bengal and moved in a northânortheasterly direction. The thermodynamic characteristics of this system are investigated by utilizing the surface and upper air observations collected onboard \textit {ORV Sagar Kanya} over the Bay of Bengal region. The response of the cyclonic storm is clearly evident from the ship observations when the ship was within the distance of 600â800 km from the cyclonic storm. This study explores why (i) the whole atmosphere from surface to 500 hPa had become warm and moist during the cyclonic storm period as compared to before and after the formation of this system and (ii) the lower layer of the atmosphere had become stable during the formative stage of the cyclonic storm.</p>

				<title>Spatial monsoon variability with respect to NAO and SO</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0601-0606</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the simultaneous effect of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Southern Oscillation (SO) on monsoon rainfall over different homogeneous regions/subdivisions of India is studied.  The simultaneous effect of both NAO and SO on Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) is more important than their individual impact because both the oscillations exist simultaneously throughout the year. To represent the simultaneous impact of NAO and SO, an index called effective strength index (ESI) has been deï¬ned on the basis of monthly NAO and SO indices.</p>
					<p>The variation in the tendency of ESI from January through April has been analyzed and reveals that when this tendency is decreasing, then the ESI value throughout the monsoon season (June--September) of the year remains negative and \textit {vice versa}. This study further suggests that during the negative phase of ESI tendency, almost all subdivisions of India show above-normal rainfall and \textit {vice versa}. The correlation analysis indicates that the ESI-tendency is showing an inverse and statistically signiï¬cant relationship with rainfall over 14 subdivisions of India. Area wise, about 50% of the total area of India shows statistically signiï¬cant association. Moreover, the ESI-tendency shows a signiï¬cant relationship with rainfall over north west India, west central India, central north east India, peninsular India and India as a whole. Thus, ESI-tendency can be used as a precursor for the prediction of Indian summer monsoon rainfall on a smaller spatial scale.</p>

					<p>The paper presents the effect of $O_3$ depletion on night airglow emission of Na 5893 A line at Dumdum ($22.5^\circ N, 88.5^\circ E$), India and Halley Bay (76^\circ S, 27^\circ W$), a British Antarctic service station. Calculations based on chemical kinetics show that the airglow intensity of Na 5893 A line will also be affected due to the depletion of $O_3$ concentration. The nature of yearly variation and seasonal variation of the intensity of Na 5893 A line for the above two stations are shown and compared. It is shown that the rate of decrease of intensity of Na 5893 A line is comparatively more at Halley Bay due to the dramatic decrease of Antarctic $O_3$ concentration. A possible explanation for this dramatic decrease of Antarctic $O_3$ concentration is also mentioned.</p>

				<title>The emplacement of pahoehoe lavas on Kilauea and in the Deccan Traps</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0615-0629</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is a growing interest in deciphering the emplacement and environmental impact of ï¬ood basalt provinces such as the Deccan, India. Observations of active volcanism lead to meaningful interpretations of now-extinct volcanic systems. Here, I illustrate and discuss the morphology and emplacement of the modern and active lava ï¬ows of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii, and based on them, interpret the compound pahoehoe lavas of the Deccan Traps. The latter are vastly larger (areally extensive and voluminous) than Kilauea ï¬ows, and yet, their internal architecture is the same as that of Kilauea ï¬ows, and even the sizes of individual ï¬ow units often identical. Many or most compound ï¬ows of the Deccan Traps were emplaced in a gentle, effusive, Kilauea-like fashion. Bulk eruption rates for the Deccan province are unknown, and were probably high, but the local eruption rates of the compound ï¬ows were no larger than Kilaueaâs. Large ($\geq 1000 km^3$) individual compound pahoehoe ï¬ows in the Deccan could have been emplaced at Kilauea-like local eruption rates ($1 m^{3}/sec$ per metre length of ï¬ssure) in a decade or less, given ï¬ssures of sufficient length (tens of kilometres), now exposed as dyke swarms in the province.</p>

				<title>Primary volcanic structures from a type section of Deccan Trap flows around NarsingpurâHarraiâAmarwara, central India: Implications for cooling history</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0631-0642</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Field investigations of the Deccan Trap lava sequence along a 70 km traverse in the NarsingpurâHarraiâAmarwara area of central India indicate twenty lava ï¬ows comprising a total thickness of around 480m. Primary volcanic structures like vesicles and cooling joints are conspicuous in this volcanic succession and are used to divide individual ï¬ows into three well-deï¬ned zones namely the lower colonnade zone, entablature zone, and the upper colonnade zone. The variable nature of these structural zones is used for identiï¬cation and correlation of lava ï¬ows in the ï¬eld. For twenty lava ï¬ows, the thicknesses of upper colonnade zones of eight ï¬ows are $\sim 5m$ while those of eight other ï¬ows are $\sim 8m$ each. The thicknesses of upper colonnade zones of remaining four ï¬ows could not be measured in the ï¬eld. Using the thicknesses of these upper colonnade zones and standard temperature-ï¬ow thickness-cooling time proï¬les for lava pile, the total cooling time of these sixteen Deccan Trap lava ï¬ows has been estimated at 12 to 15 years.</p>

				<title>Is the outcrop topology of dolerite dikes of the Precambrian Singhbhum Craton fractal?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0643-0660</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the Precambrian Singhbhum Craton of eastern India, newer dolerite dikes occur profusely with varying outcrop lengths. We have analysed the nature of their length-size and orientation distributions in relation to the theory of fractals. Two orientational sets of dikes (NWâSE and NEâSW) are present. Both the sets show strongly non-power-law size distributions, as reï¬ected in nonlinear variations in logarithmic space. We analyzed thousands of data, revealing that polynomial functions with a degree of 3 to 4 are the best representatives of the non-linear variations. Orientation analysis shows that the degree of dispersions from the mean trend tends to decrease with increasing dike length. The length-size distributions were studied by simulating fractures in physical models.  Experimental fractures also show a non-power-law distribution, which grossly conforms to those of the dolerite dikes. This type of complex size distributions results from the combined effects of nucleation, propagation and coalescence of fractures.</p>

				<title>Probabilistic landslide hazards and risk mapping on Penang Island, Malaysia</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0661-0672</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with landslide hazards and risk analysis of Penang Island, Malaysia using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data. Landslide locations in the study area were identiï¬ed from interpretations of aerial photographs and ï¬eld surveys. Topographical/ geological data and satellite images were collected and processed using GIS and image processing tools. There are ten landslide inducing parameters which are considered for landslide hazard analysis. These parameters are topographic slope, aspect, curvature and distance from drainage, all derived from the topographic database; geology and distance from lineament, derived from the geologic database; landuse from Landsat satellite images; soil from the soil database; precipitation amount, derived from the rainfall database; and the vegetation index value from SPOT satellite images. Landslide susceptibility was analyzed using landslide-occurrence factors employing the probabilityâfrequency ratio model. The results of the analysis were veriï¬ed using the landslide location data and compared with the probabilistic model. The accuracy observed was 80.03%. The qualitative landslide hazard analysis was carried out using the frequency ratio model through the map overlay analysis in GIS environment. The accuracy of hazard map was 86.41%. Further, risk analysis was done by studying the landslide hazard map and damageable objects at risk. This information could be used to estimate the risk to population, property and existing infrastructure like transportation network.</p>

				<title>Elastic properties of granulite facies rocks of Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0673-0683</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Compressional and shear wave velocities and attenuation measurements have been carried out in some of the borehole samples of acidic, basic and intermediate granulites of Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, India. The results have been obtained at ambient conditions using âtime-of-ï¬ightâ pulse transmission technique at 1.0MHz frequency. The results show linear relationships between velocity and density, and velocity and attenuation properties of the rocks. The acidic granulites show lower velocities and higher attenuation than the intermediate and basic granulites. The average values of the Poissonâs ratio of acidic, intermediate and basic granulites have been found to be 0.210, 0.241 and 0.279 respectively. The variations in velocities and attenuation in these low porosity crystalline rocks are found to be strongly inï¬uenced by their mineral composition. The laboratory velocity data (extrapolated to high pressure) of the present study and the published ï¬eld velocity data from deep seismic sounding studies indicate that these granulite facies rocks may belong to mid-crustal depths only.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Biot linearized quasi-static theory of ï¬uid-inï¬ltrated porous materials is used to formulate the problem of the two-dimensional plane strain deformation of a multi-layered poroelastic half-space by surface loads. The FourierâLaplace transforms of the stresses, displacements, pore pressure and ï¬uid ï¬ux in each homogeneous layer of the multi-layered half-space are expressed in terms of six arbitrary constants. Generalized ThomsonâHaskell matrix method is used to obtain the deformation ï¬eld. Simpliï¬ed explicit expressions for the elements of the $6 \times 6$ propagator matrix for the poroelastic medium are obtained. As an example of the possible applications of the analytical formulation developed, formal solution is given for normal strip loading, normal line loading and shear line loading.</p>

				<title>Evidence of reworking and resuspension of carbonates during last glacial maximum and early deglacial period along the southwest coast of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0695-0702</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A gravity core collected from the upper slope of southwest of Quilon at a water depth of 776m (Lat: $8^\circ 12^\prime 263^\prime\prime N$, Long: $76^\circ 28^\prime 281^\prime\prime E$) was analysed for texture (carbonate free), calcium carbonate and organic carbon. Variation in silicic fraction seems  to be controlled by silt, i.e., enrichment from 15 ka BP to 10 ka BP and then constant in Holocene. Below 15 ka BP, the silicic fraction gets depleted compared to the Holocene section with a minimum around 21 ka BP. Clay content remains nearly constant except in the Holocene where it shows an enrichment. Carbonate content of less than 63 micron when computed by subtracting coarse fraction content from the total carbonate suggests that the total carbonates are mainly concentrated in the ï¬ner fraction. All these carbonate phases show an inverse relationship with silicic fraction except in Holocene. Below 15 ka BP, $CaCO_3$ dominates in sediments comprising more than 65%, such an increase is also seen in the coarse fraction. Coarse fraction from these sections contains abundant nodular type aggregates encrusting small forams. This period is marked by a high sedimentation rate comparable to Holocene. These parameters suggest that the productivity and precipitation have increased in the Holocene due to the intensiï¬cation of the southwest monsoon. During the last glacial maximum and early deglacial period the high sedimentation rate indicates redeposition of the carbonates from the existing carbonate lithofacies situated between Quilon and Cape Comorin probably due to the slope instability.</p>

				<title>Platinum group elements and gold in ferromanganese crusts from AfanasiyâNikitin seamount, equatorial Indian Ocean: Sources and fractionation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0013</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The major element relationships in ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts from Afanasiy-Nikitin seamount (ANS), eastern equatorial Indian Ocean, appear to be atypical. High positive correlations (\textit {r} = 0.99) between Mn/Co and Fe/Co ratios, and lack of correlation of those ratios with Co, Ce, and Ce/Co, indicate that the ANS Fe-Mn crusts are distinct from Pacific seamount Fe-Mn crusts, and reflect region-specific chemical characteristics. The platinum group elements (PGE: Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, and Pd) and Au in ANS Fe-Mn crusts are derived from seawater and are mainly of terrestrial origin, with a minor cosmogenic component. The Ru/Rh (0.5-2) and Pt/Ru ratios (7-28) are closely comparable to ratios in continental basalts, whereas Pd/Ir ratios exhibit values (&mt; 2) similar to CI-chondrite ($\sim 1$). The chondrite-normalized PGE patterns are similar to those of igneous rocks, except that Pd is relatively depleted. The water depth of Fe-Mn crust formation appears to have a first-order control on both major element and PGE enrichments. These relationships are defined statistically by significant (\textit {r} &lt; 0.75) correlations between water depth and Mn/Co, Fe/Co, Ce/Co, Co, and the PGEs. Fractionation of the PGE-Au from seawater during colloidal precipitation of the major-oxide phases is indicated by well-defined linear positive correlations (\textit {r} &lt; 0.8) of Co and Ce with Ir, Ru, Rh, and Pt; Au/Co with Mn/Co; and by weak or no correlations of Pd with water depth, Co-normalized major-element ratios, and with the other PGE (\textit {r} $mt; 0.5). The strong enrichment of Pt (up to 1 ppm) relative to the other PGE and its positive correlations with Ce and Co demonstrate a common link for the high concentrations of all three elements, which  likely involves an oxidation reaction on the Mn-oxide and Fe-oxyhydroxide surfaces. The documented fractionation of PGE-Au and their positive association with redox sensitive Co and Ce may have applications in reconstructing past-ocean redox conditions and water masses.</p>

				<title>Facies characteristics of the basal part of the Talchir Formation, Talchir Basin, India â depositional history revisited</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0015-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The lowest unit of the Talchir Formation of Talchir Basin, Orissa, was described by pioneer workers as the 'basal oulder bed'. In an attempt to explain the co-existence of gravel and clay, materials of contrasting hydraulic properties, a probable situation resembling the effects of the action of ground-ice enabled boulders to be carried down by sluggish currents resulting in an intermixture of large boulders and fine mud was conceived. Misinterpretation of this conclusion led to a general tendency to describe the 'basal boulder bed' as 'glacial tillite'. However, the unit described as 'basal boulder bed is actually represented by a matrix rich conglomerate with pockets of normally graded silty clay. The present study reveals that the depositional imprints preserved in this part of the sedimentary succession indicate emplacement of successive debris flows generated through remobilization of pre-existing unconsolidated sediments. Small pockets of fine-grained turbidites presumably deposited from the entrained turbidity currents associated with the debris flows suggest the composite character of the debris flow deposit.</p>

				<page>0021-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The granulite complex around Jenapore, Orissa, Eastern Ghats granulite belt, bears the imprint of two episodes of strong deformation ($D_1$ and $D_2$) attended with foliation (fabric) development ($S_1$ and $S_2$). Two distinct metamorphic events at \textit {P-T} conditions of $\sim 900^\circ C$ at $\sim 9kbar$ and $\sim 600^\circ C$ at $\sim 6 kbar$ are correlated with $D_1$ and $D_2$ respectively. The reaction textures in $S_1$-microdomains are interpreted to be the product of near isobaric cooling at $\sim 9 kbar$ from $950^\circ C$ to $600^\circ C$, whereas those in the $S_2$-microdomains are considered to be the result of an up-pressure trajectory from $\sim 6$ kbar at $600^\circ C$. The $D_{1}--M_{1}$ high \textit {P-T} granulite event is interpreted to be Archean in age (ca. 3Ga) on the basis of the isotopic data obtained from the charnockite suite of the area. The later relatively low \textit {P-T} granulite facies event, attendant to $D_{2}--S_{2}$ is considered to be related to the Grenvillian orogeny as represented by the dominant isotopic record in the belt.</p>

				<title>The effects of attenuation and site on the spectra of microearthquakes in the Jubilee Hills region of Hyderabad, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microearthquake spectra from Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad are analyzed to observe the effect of attenuation and site on these spectra. The ratios of spectral amplitudes at lower and higher frequency are measured for three different stations at varying epicentral distances to estimate Q value for both P- and S-wave in near and sub-surface layer. Average estimates of Qp and Qs are 235 and 278 respectively. Value of Qs/Qp larger than 1.0 suggests dry crust for most of the Jubilee Hills region. The near-surface low Qp and Qs for 0 km to 0.9 km depth coincide with the soil layer, top and semi-weathered and highly fractured zone. In contrast, at a shallower depth beneath the Jubilee Hills area, Hyderabad, we obtain high Qp and Qs zone, which corresponds to the dense and high velocity rocks of the region. The varying corner frequencies for these spectra are inferred to be characteristics of site. Comparisons of disparity in spectral content with reference to hard rock site conclude that lithology of the northwest part of Jubilee Hills area amplify about twice the incoming seismic signal, as compared to the southern part best outlined at 8 to 10Hz only.</p>

				<title>Spatial analyses of groundwater levels using universal kriging</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0049-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For water levels, generally a non-stationary variable, the technique of universal kriging is applied in preference to ordinary kriging as the interpolation method. Each set of data in every sector can fit different empirical semivariogram models since they have different spatial structures. These models can be classifiÂed as circular, spherical, tetraspherical, pentaspherical, exponential, gaussian, rational quadratic, hole effect, K-bessel, J-bessel and stable. This study aims to determine which of these empirical semivariogram models will be best matched with the experimental models obtained from groundwater-table values collected from Mustafakemalpasa left bank irrigation scheme in 2002. The model having the least error was selected by comparing the observed water-table values with the values predicted by empirical semivariogram models. It was determined that the rational quadratic empirical semivariogram model is the best fitted model for the studied irrigation area.</p>

				<title>The light transmission and seiche depth of Izmir Bay, western Turkey</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0057-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Izmir Bay is one of the most polluted estuaries in the whole Mediterranean Sea. The inner part of the Bay (Inner Bay) is heavily affected by domestic and industrial discharge. As a result of these loads, strong eutrophication occurs in the Inner Bay, which is temporally anaerobic. The ecologically sensitive approach of the local authorities during the last decade has given rise to a wide variety of monitoring and research studies on this bay. On the other hand, the municipality of Izmir started to operate wastewater treatment facilities since January 2000. The Institute of Marine Sciences and Technology - Izmir (IMST) with its research vessel R/V K Piri Reis has been conducting an intensive monitoring program since 1988 and especially during the recent few years. These investigations provide an opportunity for the evaluation of the performance of the wastewater treatment plant in terms of the change in the optical properties of Izmir Bay water in a positive manner. The turbidity values measured in these monitoring studies indicate that the values have changed drastically after January 2000. Their spatial variation indicates that the values decrease from the Inner Bay towards the Aegean Sea. The turbidity (light transmission) values are measured with an automatic CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) system during each cruise. The seiche disc depth measurement is carried out only occasionally. The accuracy of the seiche disc depth is dependent on certain daylight conditions and depends on the operator. The seiche disc depth \textit {(D_s)} is an important parameter to estimate primary production of organic matter (hereafter called production). A relation between light transmission (turbidity) value and seiche disc depth \textit {(D_s)} is found with very good agreement. The correlations are very high (approximately 0.94) with slight seasonal variation.</p>

				<title>Long range prediction of Indian summer monsoon rainfall</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0073-0079</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The search for new parameters for predicting the all India summer monsoon rainfall (AISMR) has been an important aspect of long range prediction of AISMR. In recent years NCEP/NCAR reanalysis has improved the geographical coverage and availability of the data and this can be easily updated. In this study using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data on temperature, zonal and meridional wind at different pressure levels, few predictors are identified and a prediction scheme is developed for predicting AISMR. The regression coeffcients are computed by stepwise multiple regression procedure. The final equation explained 87% of the variance with multiple correlation coeffcient (MCC), 0.934. The estimated rainfall in the El-Nino year of 1997 was -1.7% as against actual of 4.4%. The estimated rainfall deficiency in both the recent deficient years of 2002 and 2004 were -19.5% and -8.5% as against observed -20.4% and -11.5% respectively.</p>

				<title>Impact cratering â fundamental process in geoscience and planetary science</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0081-0098</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Impact cratering is a geological process characterized by ultra-fast strain rates, which generates extreme shock pressure and shock temperature conditions on and just below planetary surfaces. Despite initial skepticism, this catastrophic process has now been widely accepted by geoscientists with respect to its importance in terrestrial â indeed, in planetary â evolution. About 170 impact structures have been discovered on Earth so far, and some more structures are considered to be of possible impact origin. One major extinction event, at the CretaceousâPaleogene boundary, has been ï¬rmly linked with catastrophic impact, but whether other important extinction events in Earth history, including the so-called âMother of All Mass Extinctionsâ at the PermianâTriassic boundary, were triggered by huge impact catastrophes is still hotly debated and a subject of ongoing research. There is a beneï¬cial side to impact events as well, as some impact structures worldwide have been shown to contain signiï¬cant (in some cases, world class) ore deposits, including the goldâ uranium province of the Witwatersrand basin in South Africa, the enormous Ni and PGE deposits of the Sudbury structure in Canada, as well as important hydrocarbon resources, especially in North America. Impact cratering is not a process of the past, and it is mandatory to improve knowledge of the past-impact record on Earth to better constrain the probability of such events in the future. In addition, further improvement of our understanding of the physicoâchemical and geological processes fundamental to the impact cratering process is required for reliable numerical modeling of the process, and also for the correlation of impact magnitude and environmental effects. Over the last few decades, impact cratering has steadily grown into an integrated discipline comprising most disciplines of the geosciences as well as planetary science, which has created positive spin-offs including the study of paleo-environments and paleo-climatology, or the important issue of life in extreme environments. And yet, in many parts of the world, the impact process is not yet part of the geoscience curriculum, and for this reason, it deserves to be actively promoted not only as a geoscientiï¬c discipline in its own right, but also as an important life-science discipline.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0099-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Biot linearized theory of ï¬uid saturated porous materials is used to study the plane strain deformation of a two-phase medium consisting of a homogeneous, isotropic, poroelastic half-space in welded contact with a homogeneous, isotropic, perfectly elastic half-space caused by a twodimensional source in the elastic half-space. The integral expressions for the displacements and stresses in the two half-spaces in welded contact are obtained from the corresponding expressions for an unbounded elastic medium by applying suitable boundary conditions at the interface. The case of a long dip-slip fault is discussed in detail. The integrals for this source are solved analytically for two limiting cases: (i) undrained conditions in the high frequency limit, and (ii) steady state drained conditions as the frequency approaches zero. It has been veriï¬ed that the solution for the drained case ($\omega â 0$) coincides with the known elastic solution. The drained and undrained displacements and stresses are compared graphically. Diffusion of the pore pressure with time is also studied.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0113-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sedimentary basins that dominate the north-eastern Mediterranean (AdanaâCilicia basins in the west and Iskenderun basin in the east) are located on the ï¬anks of a partly submerged positive structure (a part of the AfricaâEurasia convergence zone) along which strike-slip faults are evident. This study summarizes the ï¬ndings of two seismic surveys carried out in the Alanyaâ Mersin offshore region. Some 850 km of geophysical survey lines were compiled on these cruises. Based on the results determined from these surveys, the north and central part of AdanaâCilicia basin can be subdivided into eastern, central and western structural sub-basins separated by the EcemiÂ¸s fault complex in the east and the AnamurâKormakiti  structural high in the west at the same time. Results of this study also indicate that EcemiÂ¸s and AnamurâKormakiti faults are active. Late Miocene regional compression was responsible for the compartmentation of this complex into the present arrangement and has initiated the rotational regime which has governed subsequent tectonic developments, notably the extensional behaviour of the NEâSW trending EcemiÂ¸s and AnamurâKormakiti faults and the transpressive behaviour of the NNEâSSW trending border fault complex.</p>

				<title>Depositional conditions of the coal-bearing Hirka Formation beneath Late Miocene explosive volcanic products in NW central Anatolia, Turkey</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0125-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work focuses on the relationship between the coal deposition and explosive volcanism of the Miocene basin, NW central Anatolia, Turkey. The coal-bearing Hirka Formation was deposited over the Galatian Andesitic Complex and/or massive lagoonal environments during the Miocene. The investigated lignite is a high ash (from 32 to 58%) and sulphur (from 1.43 to 3.03%) lignite which is petrographically characterised by a high humunite content. The mineral matter of the studied lignite samples is made up of mainly clay minerals (illiteâsmectite and kaolinite), plagioclase and quartz in Bolu coal ï¬eld, clay minerals (illiteâsmectite, smectite and illite), quartz, calcite, plagioclase and gypsum in Seben coal ï¬eld, quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and clay minerals (kaolinite and illite) in KÄ±brÄ±scÄ±k, and dolomite, quartz, clinoptilolite, opal CT and gypsum in CÂ¸ amlÄ±dere coal ï¬eld. The differences in these four types of lignite with speciï¬c mineralogical patterns may be due to the explosive volcanic events and depositional conditions which changed from one coal ï¬eld to the others. There is a zonation from SW to SE in the studied area for zeolites such as Opal CT+smectite-clinoptilolite-analcime-K-feldspar. Carbonate minerals are commonly calcite in Seben and KÄ±brÄ±scÄ±k coal ï¬elds. In Bolu, coal samples are devoid of calcite and dolomite. These analyses show that there is an increase in the amount of Mg and a decrease in the amount of Na from the northwestern part to the southern part in the study area.</p>

				<title>Volatile displacement of Meghalaya coals â A pointer to explore low sulphur coals</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0137-0142</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Volatile displacement, which measures the difference between calculated and experimental volatile matter, is indicative of abnormality in coals which may be related to petrological or chemical parameters. The volatile displacement ($\delta v$) values of Meghalaya coals were calculated from their chemical analyses. Correlations of volatile displacement ($\delta v$) with parameters such as carbon, hydrogen, moisture, oxygen, oxygen plus sulphate sulphur, oxygen plus pyritic sulphur, oxygen plus organic sulphur and total sulphur were studied. An approximately linear relationship exists only between $\delta v$ and moisture, and $\delta v$ and total sulphur, and not between other parameters. Plots on Seylerâs chart indicate the coals as perhydrous to orthohydrous. The linear relationship with total sulphur indicates that the coals may have become abnormal mainly due to the marine environment of deposition and weathering.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the occurrence of vesuvianite + wollastonite + grossular + diopside + microcline + quartz assemblage in an enclave of calc-silicate rocks occurring within quartzofeldspathic gneiss near Tatapani in the western part of Chhotanagpur Gneissic Complex. The enclave contains phlogopite-absent and phlogopite-bearing calc-silicate rocks, the latter being much more abundant than the former. The above assemblage occurs in the phlogopite-absent rock. Phlogopite-bearing rock contains the assemblage phlogopite + salite + microcline + plagioclase + quartz. A strong schistosity is developed in both the calc-silicate rocks and the minerals are syntectonic with the major foliation-forming event in the area. The vesuvianite-bearing assemblage is formed by amphibolite facies regional metamorphism of a calcareous protolith at pressure &mt; 4 kbar and $X_{CO}_{2} $ (ï¬uid) &mt; 0.15.</p>

				<title>The role of low-frequency intraseasonal oscillations in the anomalous Indian summer monsoon rainfall of 2002</title>

				<page>0149-0157</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyze the dynamical features and responsible factors of the low-frequency intraseasonal time scales which inï¬uenced the nature of onset, intensity and duration of active/break phases and withdrawal of the monsoon during the anomalous Indian summer monsoon of 2002 â the most severe drought recorded in recent times. During that season, persistent warm sea surface temperature anomalies over the equatorial Indian Ocean played a signiï¬cant role in modulating the strength of the monsoon Hadley circulation. This in turn affected the onset and intense break spells especially the long break during the peak monsoon month of July. Strong low-frequency intraseasonal modulations with signiï¬cant impact on the onset and active/break phases occurred in 2002 which were manifested as a good association between low-frequency intraseasonal oscillations and the onset and active/break spells. Further, SST anomalies over the equatorial Indo-Paciï¬c region on low-frequency intraseasonal time scales were found to affect the equatorial eastward and thereby off-equatorial northward propagations of enhanced convection over the Indian region. These propagations in turn modulated the active/break cycle deciding the consequent severity of the 2002 drought.</p>

				<title>Sensitivity of surface radiation budget to clouds over the Asian monsoon region</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0159-0169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the ISCCPâFD surface radiative ï¬ux data for the summer season (June to September) of the period 1992 to 1995, an analysis was done to understand the role of clouds on the surface radiation budget over the Asian monsoon region. At the top of atmosphere (TOA) of convective regions of the Asian monsoon region, the short wave radiative forcing (SWCRF)  and long wave radiative forcing (LWCRF) do not cancel each other resulting in occurrence of the net cloud radiative forcing values exceeding $â30W/m^{2} $. This type of imbalance between SWCRF and LWCRF at TOA is reï¬ected down on the earth surfaceâatmosphere system also as an imbalance between surface netcloud radiative forcing (NETCRF) and atmospheric NETCRF.</p>
					<p>Based on the regression analysis of the cloud effects on the surface radiation budget quantities, it has been observed that generally, the variance explained by multiple type cloud data is 50% more than that of total cloud cover alone. In case of SWCRF, the total cloud cover can explain about 3% (7%) of the variance whereas the three cloud type descriptions of clouds can explain about 44% (42%) of the variance over oceanic (land) regions. This highlights the importance of cloud type information in explaining the variations of surface radiation budget. It has been observed that the clouds produce more cooling effect in short-wave band than the warming effect in long-wave band resulting in a net cooling at the surface. Over the oceanic region, variations in high cloud amount contribute more to variations in SWCRF while over land regions both middle and high cloud variations make substantial contributions to the variations in both SWCRF and NETCRF.</p>

					<p>This paper attempts at full characterization of the unique global 8.2Kyr B.P. cooling event. Significant atmospheric cooling started during 9.5â8.5Kyr B.P. when the Sun was extremely quiet during three periods of $\sim 50â100$ years. The flood of melt water in the N. Atlantic from glacial lakes during the demise of the Laurentide ice sheet, starting at $\sim 8.5Kyr$ B.P., adds to the atmospheric cooling. Climatic forcing events occurred at 8.5Kyr B.P., at 8.2Kyr B.P. and finally at 8.06Kyr B.P., leading to concurrent increases or decreases in the atmospheric $\Delta ^{14}C$ levels, completely consistent with the climatic forcing proposed here.</p>

				<title>Fairweather atmospheric electricity at Antarctica during local summer as observed from Indian station, Maitri</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0179-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface measurements of the atmospheric electrical parameters like Maxwell current, electric field and conductivity studied at the Indian station, Maitri ($70.75^\circ S, 11.75^\circ  E, 117m$ above mean sea level), Antarctica, during austral summer have been analyzed for the years 2001 to 2004. A total of 69 days were selected which satisfied the âfairweatherâ conditions, i.e., days with absence of high winds, drifting or falling snow, clouds, and fog effects. The diurnal variation curve of electric field and vertical current averaged for 69 fairweather days is a single periodic with a minimum at 03:00UT and a maximum near 19:00UT, which is very similar to the Carnegie curve. The correlation coefficient between these measured parameters has a high value (more than 0.9) for all the days. During fairweather days the measured current and field variations are similar and hence it is clear that the conductivity is more or less stable. During magnetically disturbed days, the dawn-dusk potential drop has clear influences on the diurnal variation and it modifies the conductivity. Apart from the day-to-day variation in low latitude thunderstorm activity, there are diurnal, seasonal, inter-annual variations in the electric potential and the currents, as well as solar influences on the measured parameters. This study will help us to examine the impact of solar and geophysical phenomena like solar flares, geomagnetic storms and substorms on the global electric circuit.</p>

					<p>Objective analysis of daily rainfall at the resolution of $1^\circ $ grid for the Indian monsoon region has been carried out merging dense land rainfall observations and INSAT derived precipitation estimates. This daily analysis, being based on high dense rain gauge observations was found to be very realistic and able to reproduce detailed features of Indian summer monsoon. The inter-comparison with the observations suggests that the new analysis could distinctly capture characteristic features of the summer monsoon such as northâsouth oriented belt of heavy rainfall along the Western Ghats with sharp gradient of rainfall between the west coast heavy rain region and the rain shadow region to the east, pockets of heavy rainfall along the location of monsoon trough/low, over the east central parts of the country, over northâeast India, along the foothills of Himalayas and over the north Bay of Bengal. When this product was used to assess the quality of other available standard climate products (CMAP and ECMWF reanalysis) at the grid resolution of $2.5^\circ $, it was found that the orographic heavy rainfall along Western Ghats of India was poorly identified by them. However, the GPCC analysis (gauge only) at the resolution of $1^\circ $ grid closely discerns the new analysis. This suggests that there is a need for a higher resolution analysis with adequate rain gauge observations to retain important aspects of the summer monsoon over India. The case studies illustrated show that the daily analysis is able to capture large-scale as well as mesoscale features of monsoon precipitation systems. This study with data of two seasons (2001 and 2003) has shown sufficiently promising results for operational application, particularly for the validation of NWP models.</p>

				<title>Estimation of seismic spectral acceleration in Peninsular India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0199-0214</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Peninsular India (PI), which lies south of $24^\circ N$ latitude, has experienced several devastating earthquakes in the past. However, very few strong motion records are available for developing attenuation relations for ground acceleration, required by engineers to arrive at rational design response spectra for construction sites and cities in PI. Based on a well-known seismological model, the present paper statistically simulates ground motion in PI to arrive at an empirical relation for estimating 5% damped response spectra, as a function of magnitude and source to site distance, covering bedrock and soil conditions. The standard error in the proposed relationship is reported as a function of the frequency, for further use of the results in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0215-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyse the seismicity pattern including \textit {b}-value in the north SumatraâGreat Nicobar region from 1976 to 2004. The analysis suggests that there were a number of significant, intermediate and short-term precursors before the magnitude 7.6 earthquake of 2 November 2002. However, they were not found to be so prominent prior to the magnitude 9.0 earthquake of 26 December 2004 though downward migration of activity and a 50-day short-term quiescence was observed before the event. The various precursors identified include post-seismic and intermediate-term quiescence of 13 and 10 years respectively, between the 1976 (magnitude 6.3) and 2002 earthquakes with two years (1990â1991) of increase in background seismicity; renewed seismicity, downward migration of seismic activity and foreshocks in 2002, just before the mainshock. Spatial variation in \textit {b}-value with time indicates precursory changes in the form of high \textit {b}-value zone near the epicenter preceding the mainshocks of 2004 and 2002 and temporal rise in \textit {b}-value in the epicentral area before the 2002 earthquake.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The propagation of elastic waves along a cylindrical borehole filled with/without liquid and embedded in an infinite porous medium saturated by two immiscible fluids has been studied. The theory of porous media saturated by two immiscible fluids developed by Tuncay and Corapcioglu (1997) is employed. Frequency equations determining the phase velocity of axial symmetric waves are obtained. It is found that the surface waves along cylindrical borehole are dispersive. The dispersion equation of Rayleigh-type surface waves along the boundary of a poroelastic solid half-space saturated by two immiscible fluids is also obtained. Some special cases have been deduced and the dispersion curves are obtained numerically for a peculiar model. It is found that the density of fluids affects the Rayleigh mode.</p>

				<title>Monitoring the three-dimensional ionospheric electron density distribution using GPS observations over China</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0235-0244</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, an IRI model assisted GPS-based Computerized Ionospheric Tomography (CIT) technique is developed to inverse the ionospheric electron density (IED) distribution over China. Essentially, an improved algebraic reconstruction technique (IART) is first proposed to reconstruct the ionospheric images with high resolution and high efficiency. A numerical experiment is used to validate the reliability of the method and its advantages to the classical algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). This is then used to reconstruct the IED images using the GPS data in China. The variations of the IED during magnetically quiet and disturbed days are reported and analyzed here. Reconstructed results during magnetically quiet days show some prominent ionospheric features such as the development of equatorial anomaly and the tilt of ionization crest. Meanwhile, ionospheric storm phase effects and disturbed features can also be revealed from the reconstructed IED image under storm conditions. Research shows that the positive storm phase effects usually happen in southern China, and the negative storm phase effects mainly occur in northern China. The equatorial anomaly crest moved to the north in the main phase of the storm. Ionosonde data recorded at Wuhan station provides the verification for the reliability of GPS-based CIT technique.</p>

					<p>Banded iron-formations (BIF) form an important part of the Archean supracrustal belts of the JharkhandâOrissa region, India. Major, trace and REE chemistry of the banded iron-formation of the Gandhamardan, Deo Nala, Gorumahisani and Noamundi sections of the JharkhandâOrissa region are utilized to explore the source of metals and to address the thermal regime of the basin floor and the redox conditions of the archean sea. Hydrothermal fluids of variable temperatures might have contributed the major part of the Fe and other trace elements to the studied banded iron-formations. Diagenetic fluids from the sea floor sediments and river water might have played a subdued role in supplying the Fe and other elements for the banded iron-formations.</p>

				<title>Improved bathymetric datasets for the shallow water regions in the Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0261-0274</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ocean modellers use bathymetric datasets like ETOPO5 and ETOPO2 to represent the ocean bottom topography. The former dataset is based on digitization of depth contours greater  than 200m, and the latter is based on satellite altimetry. Hence, they are not always reliable in shallow regions. An improved shelf bathymetry for the Indian Ocean region ($20^\circ E$ to $112^\circ E$ and $38^\circ S$ to $32^\circ N$) is derived by digitizing the depth contours and sounding depths less than 200m from the hydrographic charts published by the National Hydrographic Office, India. The digitized data are then gridded and used to modify the existing ETOPO5 and ETOPO2 datasets for depths less than 200 m. In combining the digitized data with the original ETOPO dataset, we apply an appropriate blending technique near the 200m contour to ensure smooth merging of the datasets. Using the modified ETOPO5, we demonstrate that the original ETOPO5 is indeed inaccurate in depths of less than 200m and has features that are not actually present on the ocean bottom. Though the present version of ETOPO2 (ETOPO2v2) is a better bathymetry compared to its earlier versions, there are still differences between the ETOPO2v2 and the modified ETOPO2. We assess the improvements of these bathymetric grids with the performance of existing models of tidal circulation and tsunami propagation.</p>

				<title>Assimilation of Doppler weather radar observations in a mesoscale model for the prediction of rainfall associated with mesoscale convective systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0275-0304</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Obtaining an accurate initial state is recognized as one of the biggest challenges in accurate model prediction of convective events. This work is the first attempt in utilizing the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Doppler radar data in a numerical model for the prediction of mesoscale convective complexes around Chennai and Kolkata. Three strong convective events both over Chennai and Kolkata have been considered for the present study. The simulation experiments have been carried out using fifth-generation Pennsylvania State UniversityâNational Center for Atmospheric Research (PSUâNCAR) mesoscale model (MM5) version 3.5.6. The variational data assimilation approach is one of the most promising tools available for directly assimilating the mesoscale observations in order to improve the initial state. The horizontal wind derived from the DWR has been used alongwith other conventional and non-conventional data in the assimilation system. The preliminary results from the three dimensional variational (3DVAR) experiments are encouraging. The simulated rainfall has also been compared with that derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The encouraging result from this study can be the basis for further investigation of the direct assimilation of radar reflectivity data in 3DVAR system. The present study indicates that Doppler radar data assimilation improves the initial field and enhances the Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (QPF) skill.</p>

				<title>Surface and upper air meteorological features during onset phase of 2003 monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0305-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The second campaign of the Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX-II) was conducted in two phases viz., MarchâApril and MayâJune 2003. In the present work, the buoy and ocean research vessel data collected during the second phase of ARMEX-II have been analysed to bring out the characteristic features of monsoon onset. The results have shown that the thermodynamical features such as build up of lower tropospheric instability and increased height of zero degree isotherm occurred about a week before the monsoon onset over Kerala and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea. There was a sharp fall in the temperature difference between 850 and 500 hPa, and the height of zero degree isotherm about 2â3 days before the monsoon onset. The flux of sensible heat was positive (sea to air) over south Arabian Sea during the onset phase. Over the Bay of Bengal higher negative (air to sea) values of sensible flux prevailed before the  monsoon onset which became less negative with the advance of monsoon over that region.</p>
					<p>The pre-onset period was characterized by large sea surface temperature (SST) gradient over the Arabian Sea with rapid decrease towards north of the warm pool region. The buoy observations have shown that SST remained close to $30.5^\circ C$ in the warm pool region during the pre-onset period in 2003 but only 2â3 degrees away (north of this region) SSTs were as low as $28.5â29^\circ C$. An interesting aspect of sea level pressure (SLP) variability over the Indian seas during the onset phase of summer monsoon 2003 was undoubtedly, the highest SLP in the warm pool region inspite of very high SSTs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Annual maxima of daily rainfall for the years 1961â2001 are modeled for five locations in South Korea (chosen to give a good geographical representation of the country). The generalized extreme value distribution is fitted to data from each location to describe the extremes of rainfall and to predict its future behavior. We find evidence to suggest that the Gumbel distribution provides the most reasonable model for four of the five locations considered. We explore the possibility of trends in the data but find no evidence suggesting trends. We derive estimates of 10, 50, 100, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 50,000 and 100,000 year return levels for daily rainfall and describe how they vary with the locations. This paper provides the first application of extreme value distributions to rainfall data from South Korea.</p>

				<title>Identification of homogeneous rainfall regimes in parts of Western Ghats region of Karnataka</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0321-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In view of the ongoing environmental and ecological changes in the Western Ghats, it is important to understand the environmental parameters pertaining to the sustenance of the region. Rainfall is one such parameter governing the hydrological processes crucial to agriculture planning, afforestation and eco-system management. Therefore, it is essential to understand rainfall distribution and its variation in relevance to such activities. The present study is an attempt to gain in-depth understanding in this direction. The study area comprises of one coastal district and its adjoining areas in Karnataka State. Mean annual rainfall data of 93 rain gauge stations distributed over the study area for a period of 10â50 years are used for the study. In order to assess the variation of rainfall across the ghats, several bands were constructed parallel to the latitudes to facilitate the analysis. The statistical analyses conducted included cluster analysis and analysis of variance. The study revealed that there exist three distinct zones of rainfall regimes in the study area, namely, Coastal zone, Transition zone and Malanad zone. It is observed that, the maximum rainfall occurs on the windward side ahead of the geographical peak. Further, mean monthly rainfall distribution over the zones has been depicted to enable agricultural planning in the study area.</p>

				<title>Vertical propagation of baroclinic Kelvin waves along the west coast of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0331-0339</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A linear, continuously stratified ocean model is used to investigate vertical propagation of remotely forced, baroclinic Kelvin waves along the Indian west coast. The extent of vertical propagation over  the length of the coast is found to be an increasing function of the forcing frequency. Simulations show that, over the length of the Indian west coast, vertical propagation is limited  at annual and semi-annual periods, but significant at periods shorter than about 120 days. This has two major consequences. First, the depth of subsurface currents associated with these frequencies varies substantially along the coast. Second, baroclinic Kelvin waves generated in the Bay of Bengal at periods shorter than about 120 days have negligible influence on surface currents along the north Indian west coast.</p>

				<title>Discharge estimation from planform characters of the Shedhi River, Gujarat alluvial plain: Present and past</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0341-0346</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the absence of long-term hydrologic and streamflow records an understanding of river morphology (present and past) can help delineate changes in magnitudes of water and sediment discharges. The relict drainage system of Gujarat alluvial plain provides an opportunity to reconstruct the palaeochannel morphology-related discharge estimations. In this paper, based on the geomorphological evidence and channel geometry, an attempt has been made to reconstruct the palaeohydrological condition in the Shedhi River during the Holocene. A comparison of the present day channel of the Shedhi River with that of its palaeo counterpart reveals that the former was carrying much higher bankfull discharge ($\sim 5500 m^{3} s^{â1}$) as compared to the present ($\sim 200m^{3} s^{â1}$). This is attributed to a larger drainage area and enhanced precipitation in the Shedhi River basin.</p>

				<title>2-D Crustal thermal structure along ThuadaraâSindad DSS profile across Narmadaâ Son lineament, central India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0347-0355</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Central India is traversed by a WSWâENE trending NarmadaâSon lineament (NSL) which is characterized by the presence of numerous hot springs, feeder dykes for Deccan Traps and seismicity all along its length. It is divided in two parts by the BarwaniâSukta Fault (BSF). To the west of this fault a graben exists, whereas to the east the basement is uplifted between Narmada North Fault (NNF) and Narmada South Fault (NSF). The present work deals with the 2-D thermal modeling to delineate the crustal thermal structure of the western part of NSL region  along the ThuadaraâSindad Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) profile which runs almost in the NâS direction across the NSL. Numerical results of the model reveal that the conductive surface heat flow value in the region under consideration varies between 45 and $47mW/m^2$. Out of which $23mW/m^2$ is the contribution from the mantle heat flow and the remaining from within the crust. The Curie depth is found to vary between 46 and 47 km and is in close agreement with the earlier reported Curie depth estimated from the analysis of MAGSAT data. The Moho temperature varies between 470 and $500^\circ C$. This study suggests that this western part of central Indian region is characterized by low mantle heat flow which in turn makes the lower crust brittle and amenable to the occurrence of deep focused earthquakes such as Satpura (1938) earthquake.</p>

				<title>Wave propagation in a general anisotropic poroelastic medium: Biotâs theories and homogenisation theory</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0357-0367</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Anisotropic wave propagation is studied in a fluid-saturated porous medium, using two different approaches. One is the dynamic approach of Biotâs theories. The other approach known as homogenisation theory, is based on the averaging process to derive macroscopic equations from the microscopic equations of motion. The medium considered is a general anisotropic poroelastic (APE) solid with a viscous fluid saturating its pores of anisotropic permeability. The wave propagation phenomenon in a saturated porous medium is explained through two relations. One defines modified Christoffel equations for the propagation of plane harmonic waves in the medium. The other defines a matrix to relate the relative displacement of fluid particles to the displacement of solid particles. The modified Christoffel equations are solved further to get a quartic equation whose roots represent complex velocities of the four attenuating quasi-waves in the medium. These complex velocities define the phase velocities of propagation and quality factors for attenuation of all the quasi-waves propagating along a given phase direction in three-dimensional space. The derivations in the mathematical models from different theories are compared in order to work out the equivalence between them. The variations of phase velocities and attenuation factors with the direction of phase propagation are computed, for a realistic numerical model. Differences between the velocities and attenuations of quasi-waves from the two approaches are exhibited numerically.</p>

				<title>Current status of multimodel superensemble and operational NWP forecast of the Indian summer monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0369-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the last thirty years great strides have been made by large-scale operational numerical weather prediction models towards improving skills for the medium range time-scale of 7 days.This paper illustrates the use of these current forecasts towards the construction of a consensus multimodel forecast product called the superensemble.This procedure utilizes 120 of the recent-past forecasts from these models to arrive at the training phase statistics.These statistics are described by roughly $10^7$ weights.Use of these weights provides the possibility for real-time medium range forecasts with the superensemble.We show the recent status of this procedure towards real-time forecasts for the Asian summer monsoon.The member models of our suite include ECMWF,NCEP/EMC, JMA,NOGAPS (US Navy),BMRC,RPN (Canada)and an FSU global spectral forecast model. We show in this paper the skill scores for day 1 through day 6 of forecasts from standard variables such as winds,temperature,500 hPa geopotential height,sea level pressure and precipitation.In all cases we noted that the superensemble carries a higher skill compared to each of the member models and their ensemble mean.The skill matrices we use include the RMS errors,the anomaly correlations and equitable threat scores.For many of these forecasts the improvements of skill for the superensemble over the best model was found to be quite substantial.This real-time product is being provided to many interested research groups.The FSU multimodel superensemble,in real- time,stands out for providing the least errors among all of the operational large scale models.</p>

				<title>Link between convection and meridional gradient of sea surface temperature in the Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0385-0406</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We use daily satellite estimates of sea surface temperature (SST)and rainfall during 1998 â2005 to show that onset of convection over the central Bay of Bengal ($88--92^\circ E,14--18^\circ N$)during the core summer monsoon (mid-May to September)is linked to the meridional gradient of SST in the bay.The SST gradient was computed between two boxes in the northern ($88--92^\circ E,18--22^\circ N$) and southern ($82--88^\circ E,4--8^\circ N$)bay;the latter is the area of the cold tongue in the bay linked to the Summer Monsoon Current.Convection over central bay followed the SST difference between the northern and southern bay ($\Delta \textit {T} $) exceeding $0.75^\circ C$ in 28 cases.There was no instance of $\Delta \textit {T}$ exceeding this threshold without a burst in convection.There were,however,ï¬ve instances of convection occurring without this SST gradient.Long rainfall events (events lasting more than a week)were associated with an SST event ($\Delta \textit {T} \geq 0.75^\circ C$);rainfall events tended to be short when not associated with an SST event.The SST gradient was important for the onset of convection, but not for its persistence:convection often persisted for several days even after the SST gradient weakened.The lag between $\Delta \textit {T}$ exceeding $0.75^\circ C$ and the onset of convection was 0--18 days,but the lag histogram peaked at one week.In 75% of the 28 cases,convection occurred within a week of $\Delta \textit {T}$ exceeding the threshold of $0.75^\CIRC C$. The northern bay SST,\textit {T_N} contributed more to $\Delta \textit {T}$ but it was a weaker criterion for convection than the SST gradient.A sensitivity analysis showed that the corresponding threshold for \textit {T_N} was $29^\circ C$. We hypothesise that the excess heating ($\sim 1^\circ C$ above the threshold for deep convection)required in the northern bay to trigger convection is because this excess in SST is what is required to establish the critical SST gradient.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0407-0411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The positional accuracy of the Global Positioning System (GPS)is limited due to several error sources.The major error is ionosphere.By augmenting the GPS,the Category I (CAT  I)Precision Approach (PA)requirements can be achieved.The Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS)in India is known as GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN).One of the prominent errors in GAGAN that limits the positional accuracy is instrumental biases.Calibration of these biases is particularly important in achieving the CAT I PA landings.In this paper,a new algorithm is proposed to estimate the instrumental biases by modelling the TEC using 4th order polynomial.The algorithm uses values corresponding to a single station for one month period and the results conï¬rm the validity of the algorithm.The experimental results indicate that the estimation precision of the satellite-plus-receiver instrumental bias is of the order of $\pm 0.17 nsec$.The observed mean bias error is of the order â 3.638 nsec and â 4.71 nsec for satellite 1 and 31 respectively.It is found that results are consistent over the period.</p>

					<p>The detailed analysis of landforms,drainages and geology of the area between the rivers Amaravati and Karjan was carried out in order to understand the tectonic history of the lower Narmada basin. Movement along the various faults in the area was studied on the basis of the drainage offsetting. Horizontal offsetting of stream channels was found quite demonstrable along NNW âSSE trending transverse faults.Tectonic landforms including systematic de ï¬ection of stream channels and ridges, alignment of fault scarp and saddles and displacement in the basement rocks and alluvial deposits show that the area is undergoing active deformation driven by the NSF system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polyphase deformation and metamorphism of pelitic schists of Chorbaoli Formation of Sausar Group in and around Ramtek area,Nagpur district,Maharashtra,India has led to the development of garnet and staurolite porphyroblasts in a predominantly quartz âmica matrix.Microstructural study of oriented thin sections of these rocks shows that garnet and staurolite have different growth histories and these porphyroblasts share a complex relationship with the matrix.Garnet shows at least two phases of growth âï¬rst intertectonic between $D_1$ and $D_2$ (pre-$D_2$ phase)and then syn-tectonic to post-tectonic with respect to $D_2$ deformation.Growth of later phase of garnet on the earlier (pre-$D_2$ garnet grains has led to the discordance of quartz inclusion trails between core and rim portion of the same garnet grain.Staurolite develops only syn-$D_2$ and shows close association with garnet of the later phase.The peak metamorphic temperature thus coincided with $D_2$ deformation,which developed the dominant crenulation schistosity ($S_2$ ,regionally persistent in the terrain.The metamorphic grade reached up to middle amphibolite facies in the study area, which is higher than the adjoining southern parts of Sausar Fold Belt.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0433-0450</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Syntectonic plutons emplaced in shallow crust often contain intermediate-to low-temperature deformation microstructures but lack a high-temperature, subsolidus deformation fabric,although the relict magmatic fabric is preserved. The Proterozoic Vellaturu granite emplaced at the eastern margin of the northern Nallamalai fold belt,south India during the late phase of regional deformation has a common occurrence of intermediate-to low-temperature deformation fabric, superimposed over magmatic fabric with an internally complex pattern. But high-T subsolidus deformation microstructure and fabric are absent in this pluton.The main crystal plastic deformation and ï¬uid enhanced reaction softening was concentrated along the margin of the granite body. Resulting granite mylonites show Y-maximum c axis fabric in completely recrystallized quartz ribbons,dynamic recrystallization of perthites,and myrmekite indicative of fabric development under intermediate temperature ($\sim 500--400^\circ C$).The weakly-deformed interior shows myrmekite,feldspar microfracturing and limited bulging recrystallization of quartz.The abundance of prism subgrain boundaries is indicative of continuing deformation through low-temperature($\sim 300^\circ C$).The relative rates of cooling in ï¬uenced by advective heat transfer and deformation of the pluton seem to control the overall subsolidus fabric development.The rapid advective heat transfer from the interior in the early stages of subsolidus cooling was followed by slow cooling through intermediate temperature window as a well-developed phyllosilicate rich mylonitic skin around the granite body slowed down conductive heat loss.Low-T crystal plastic deformation of quartz was effected at a late stage of cooling and deformation of the shallow crustal granite body emplaced within the greenschist facies Nallamalai rocks.</p>

				<title>Rainfall intensity characteristics at coastal and high altitude stations in Kerala</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0451-0463</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rainfall intensities measured at a few stations in Kerala during 2001 â2005 using a disdrometer were found to be in reasonable agreement with the total rainfall measured using a manual rain gauge. The temporal distributions of rainfall intensity at different places and during different months show that rainfall is of low intensity (&mt; 10 mm/hr),65%to 90%of the time.This could be an indication of the relative prevalence of stratiform and cumuliform clouds.Rainfall was of intensity &mt; 5 mm/hr for more than 95%of the time in Kochi in July 2002,which was a month seriously deï¬cient in rainfall,indicating that the deï¬ciency was probably due to the relative absence of cumuliform clouds.Cumulative distribution graphs are also plotted and ï¬tted with the Weibull distribution.The ï¬t parameters do not appear to have any consistent pattern. The higher intensities also contributed signi ï¬cantly to total rainfall most of the time,except in Munnar (a hill station). In this analysis also,the rainfall in Kochi in July 2002 was found to have less presence of high intensities. This supports the hypothesis that the rainfall de ï¬ciency was probably caused by the absence of conditions that favoured the formation of cumuliform clouds.</p>

				<title>Late Devonian and Triassic basalts from the southern continental margin of the East European Platform, tracers of a single heterogeneous lithospheric mantle source</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0469-0495</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In Late Devonian and Early-to-Late Triassic times, the southern continental margin of the Eastern European Platform was the site of a basaltic volcanism in the Donbas and Fore-Caucasus areas respectively. Both volcanic piles rest unconformably upon Paleoproterozoic and Late Paleozoic units respectively, and emplaced during continental rifting periods some 600 km away from expected locations of active oceanic subduction zones.</p>
					<p>This paper reports a comparative geochemical study of the basaltic rocks, and views them as the best tracers of the involved mantle below the Eastern European Platform. The Late Devonian alkaline basic rocks differ from the calc-alkaline Triassic basic rocks by their higher alkali-silica ratio, their higher $TiO_{2}, K_{2}O, P_{2}O_{5}$ and FeO contents, their higher trace element contents, a higher degree of fractionation between the most and the least incompatible elements and the absence of Ta-Nb negative anomalies. These general features, clearly distinct from those of partial melting and fractional crystallization, are due to mantle source effects. With similar Nd and Sr isotopic signatures indicating mantle-crust mixing, both suites would originate from the melting of a same but heterogeneous continental mantle lithosphere (refertilized depleted mantle). Accordingly the Nd model ages, the youngest major event associated with mantle metasomatism occurred during Early Neoproterozoic times ($\sim 650Ma$).</p>

					<p>Giant quartz veins (GQVs; earlier referred to as âquartz reefsâ) occurring in the Archean Bundelkhand Craton ($29, 000 km^2$) represent a gigantic Precambrian ($\sim 2.15 Ga$) silica-rich fluid activity in the central Indian shield. These veins form a striking curvilinear feature with positive relief having a preferred orientation NEâSW to NNEâSSW in the Bundelkhand Craton. Their outcrop widths vary from $\leq 1$ to 70m and pervasively extend over tens of kilometers along the strike over the entire craton. Numerous younger thin quartz veins with somewhat similar orientation cut across the giant quartz veins. They show imprints of strong brittle to ductileâbrittle deformation, and in places are associated with base metal and gold incidences, and pyrophyllite-diaspore mineralization. The geochemistry of giant quartz veins were studied. Apart from presenting new data on the geology and geochemistry of these veins, an attempt has been made to resolve the long standing debate on their origin, in favour of an emplacement due to tectonically controlled polyphase hydrothermal fluid activity.</p>

				<title>Geology and geochemistry of palaeoproterozoic low-grade metabasic volcanic rocks from Salumber area, Aravalli Supergroup, NW India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0511-0524</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Palaeoproterozoic Aravalli Supergroup in Salumber region includes a basal unit of metabasic volcanic rocks (Salumber volcanic rocks) overlain by a volcaniclastic/conglomerate one. Although these volcanic rocks have been metamorphosed to green-schist facies, some primary volcanic features are still preserved. This metabasic volcanic sequence can be further differentiated on the basis of textural variations, and the mineral assemblages are: (a) oligoclase + actinolite + chlorite + epidote; and (b) oligoclase + hornblende+ chlorite + biotite + Fe-Ti oxides. The $SiO_2$ content ranges from $\sim 47.7$ to 55.8% and MgO from $\sim 4.2$ to 12.8%. Geochemical characteristics allow their subdivision into high Mg and Fe tholeiites. Inverse relationship of MgO with silica, alkalis and Zr is generally consistent with fractionation mechanism, also suggested by a change in colour of the rocks from dark greenish to light greenish towards the upper parts of the sequence. These metabasic volcanic rocks are enriched in incompatible trace elements and LREE ($La = 30 â 40 \times $ chondrite, $Lu = 2 â 5 \times $ chondrite), and demonstrate affinity mainly with MORB and within plate settings in geochemical tectonic discrimination schemes. The geochemical characteristics suggest a complex evolutionary history envisaging derivation of the melt from an enriched heterogeneous lithospheric source.</p>

				<title>Origin of Cretaceous phosphorites from the onshore of Tamil Nadu, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0525-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cretaceous phosphorites from the onshore of Tamil Nadu have been investigated for their origin and compared with those in the offshore. Cretaceous phosphorites occur as light brown to yellowish brown or white nodules in Karai Shale of the Uttatur Group in the onshore Cauvery basin. Nodules exhibit phosphatic nucleus encrusted by a chalky shell of carbonate. The nucleus of the nodules consists of light and dark coloured laminae, phosphate peloids/coated grains and detrital particles interspersed between the laminae. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies reveal trapping and binding activity of microbial filaments. A mat structure with linearly arranged microbial filaments and hollow, cell-based coccoid cyanobacterial mat are present. Nodules contain abundant carbonate fluorapatite, followed by minor calcite, quartz and feldspar. The $P_{2}O_{5}$ content of the phosphorites ranges from 18 to 26%. The CaO/$P_{2}O_{5}$, Sr and F contents are higher than that of pure carbonate fluorapatite. Concentrations of Si, Al, K, Fe, and Ti are low. We suggest that the nuclei of the nodules represent phosphate clasts related to phosphate stromatolites formed at intertidal conditions. At high energy levels the microbial mats were disintegrated into phosphate clasts, coated with carbonate and then reworked into Karai Shale. On the other hand, Quaternary phosphorites occur as irregular to rounded, grey coloured phosphate clasts at water depths between 180 and 320m on the continental shelf of Tamil Nadu. They exhibit grain-supported texture. Despite Quaternary in age, they also resemble phosphate stromatolites of intertidal origin and reworked as phosphate clasts onto the shelf margin depressions. Benthic microbial mats probably supplied high phosphorus to the sediments. Availability of excess phosphorus seems to be a pre-requisite for the formation of phosphate stromatolites.</p>

				<title>Effect of initial stress on reflection at the free surface of anisotropic elastic medium</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0537-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The propagation of plane waves is considered in a general anisotropic elastic medium in the presence of initial stress. The Christoffel equations are solved into a polynomial of degree six. The roots of this polynomial represent the vertical slowness values for the six quasi-waves resulting from the presence of a discontinuity in the medium. Three of these six values are identified with the three quasi-waves traveling in the medium but away from its boundary. Reflection at the free plane surface is studied for partition of energy among the three reflected waves. For post-critical incidence, the reflected waves are inhomogeneous (evanescent) waves. Numerical examples are considered to exhibit the effects of initial stress on the phase direction, attenuation and reflection coefficients of the reflected waves. The phase velocities and energy shares of the reflected waves change significantly with initial stress as well as anisotropic symmetry. The presence of initial stress, however, has a negligible effect on the phase directions of reflected waves.</p>

				<title>Features of discrete VLF emissions observed at Gulmarg, India during the magnetic storm of 6â7 March, 1986</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0553-0559</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the analysis of archived VLF data from Indian low latitude ground stations, some discrete VLF emissions recorded at the low latitude ground station Gulmarg (geomagnetic latitude $24^\circ 26^\prime N$; geomagnetic longitude $147^\circ 09^\prime E, L =1.28$) during moderate magnetic storm activity ($\Sigma \textit {K^{â}_{P}} = 32, \textit {K_P} index varies from 4 to 6 during the observation period) on 6/7 March,  1986 are presented in this paper. The dynamic spectra of these discrete VLF emissions were observed along with tweeks and its harmonics, which is interesting and complex to explain. In most of the events the harmonic frequency of tweeks correlates with the starting frequency of harmonics of discrete emissions. In order to explain the observed features of discrete VLF emissions, we propose cyclotron resonance interaction between whistler mode wave and energetic electrons of inner radiation belt as possible generation mechanism. An attempt is also made to determine parallel energy, anisotropy and wave growth relevant to the generation process of VLF emissions.</p>

				<title>Detecting areal changes in tidal flats after sea dike construction using Landsat-TM images</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0561-0573</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main objective of this study was to estimate changes in the area of tidal flats that occurred after sea dike construction on the western coast of South Korea using Landsat-TM images. Applying the ISODATA method of unsupervised classification for Landsat-TM images, the tidal flats were identified, and the resulting areas were quantified for each image. The area of tidal flats from a topographic map published in one year differs significantly from that shown in another, which appears to be attributable to the tide levels at the time of aerial photography. During the study period, the area of tidal flats, as estimated from Landsat-TM images, increased by 4.57 $km^2$ per year in the study areas. The tidal flats in the inner sea of Chunsu Harbor area increased by $200m^2$ per zone, while the accumulation for a number of inner sea areas within Asan Harbor area occurred at over $50m^2$ per zone. The results of this research may serve as the basis of an environmentallyfriendly development plan for tidal flats.</p>

				<title>FT-IR and XRD analysis of coal from Makum coalfield of Assam</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0575-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High sulphur coal sample from Ledo colliery of Makum coalfield, Assam, India was studied using FT-IR and XRD methods. FT-IR study shows the presence of aliphatic âCH, $âCH_2$ and $âCH_3$ groups, aliphatic CâOâC stretching associated with âOH and âNH stretching vibrations and HCC rocking (single and condensed rings). XRD pattern of the coal shows that it is amorphous in nature. Function of Radial Distribution Analysis (FRDA) indicates that coal is lignite in type and there is no evidence of graphite-like structure. The first maximum in the G(\textit {r}) plot of FRDA at \textit {r} = 0.14 nm relates to the aliphatic CâC bond (Type CâCH=CHâC), the second maximum at \textit {r} = 0.25 nm relates to the distance between carbon atoms of aliphatic chains that are located across one carbon atom. The curve intensity profiles obtained from FRDA show quite regular molecular packets for this coal. The coal was found to be lignite in nature.</p>

				<title>Low-Ti melts from the southeastern Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province: Evidence for a water-rich mantle source?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province (STLIP) is one of the most voluminous volcanic provinces on Earth. The dominant erupted rocks are low-Ti basalts, which make up 80% by volume of the classical Norilâsk lava sequence. In the west Siberian basin and Maymecha-Kotuy area, the low- Ti basalts make up about 99% and 50% by volume, respectively. Dolerite sills in the Angaraâ Taseevskaya Syncline at the southeastern STLIP exhibit trace element patterns and Sr isotope ratios typical of the low-Ti basalts of the Norilâsk sequence. The most Mg-rich (MgO  9.5â11 wt%) and hence least differentiated dolerites are characterized by trace element patterns with Ta-Nb depletion, low Ce/Pb and high Sr/Pr. These trace element features are similar to water-saturated, mantle wedge-derived island arc basalts. These imply an important role of subduction fluid-derived trace elements in the source of melting beneath the AngaraâTaseevskaya Syncline and other regions of the STLIP. Less magnesium rocks (MgO 3.8â6.1 wt%) with less prominent Ta-Nb depletion, higher Ce/Pb and lower Sr/Pr could be produced via olivine-plagioclase fractionation of primary high-magnesium melts.</p>

				<title>The initiation and linkage of surface fractures above a buried strike-slip fault: An experimental approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0023-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface fractures in the overburdened sedimentary rocks, formed above a deep-seated basement fault, often provide important information about the kinematics of the underlying master fault. It has already been established that these surface fractures dynamically evolve and link one another with progressive displacement on the master fault below. In the present study, two different series of riedel-type experiments were carried out with clay analogue models under different boundary conditions viz., (i) heterogeneous simple shear of the cover rocks above a buried strike slip fault (wrench system) and (ii) heterogeneous simple shear with a component of shear-normal compression of the overburden package above a basement fault (transpressional system), to observe the initiation and linkage of surface fractures with varying \textit {T}$^\prime$ (where \textit {T}$^\prime$ = thickness of the overburden normalized with respect to the width of the master fault). In the wrench system, Riedel (R) shears were linked by principal displacement (Y) shears at early stages (shear strain of 0.8 to 1) in thin (2 &mt; \textit {T}$^\prime$ &mt; 18) models and finally (at a minimum shear strain of 1.4) gave rise to a through-going fault parallel to the basement fault without development of any other fracture. Conjugate Riedel ($R^\prime $) shears develop only within the thicker (\textit {T}$^\prime$ &lt; 18) clay models at a minimum shear strain of 0.7. With increasing deformation (at a minimum shear strain of 1.2) two $R^\prime $ shears were joined by an R shear and finally opened up to make a sigmoidal vein with an asymmetry antithetic to the major faultmovement sense. Under transpression, the results were similar to that of heterogeneous simple shear for layers 2 &mt; \textit {T}$^\prime$ &mt; 15. In layers of intermediate thickness (15 &mt; \textit {T}$^\prime$ &mt; 25) early formed high angle R shears were cross cut by low angle R shears (at a minimum shear strain of 0.5 and shortening of 0.028) and âRiedel-within-Riedelâ shears were formed within thick (\textit {T}$^\prime$ &lt; 25) models (at minimum shear strain of 0.7 and shortening of 0.1), with marked angularity of secondary fault zone with the master fault at depth.</p>

				<title>Application of GPR in the study of shallow subsurface sedimentary architecture of Modwa spit, Gulf of Kachchh</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0033-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The coastline constitutes a very sensitive geomorphic domain constantly subjected to dynamic coastal processes. The study of its ever-changing physiography and stratigraphy provides a wealth of information on its history and evolution, in many cases at decadal and annual scales. The present study was carried out on the Modwa beach complex between Rawal Pir and Modwa, about 10 km east of Mandvi on the northern coast of the Gulf of Kachchh. The Modwa spit is a 7-km long WNW-ESE trending prograding amalgamated beach ridge complex that is about 0.5 km wide at its western end and 1.5 km wide at its eastern end. This Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey delineated a variety of the radar surfaces and radar facies which reflects not only large scale sedimentary architecture, but depositional facies of the beach ridge complex. These are bounding surfaces separating the radar facies outline beach ridge (br), washover (wo), coastal dune (cd) and swale (sw) depositional environments. The internal sedimentary structures like tangential, parallel, concave and convex upward stratifications could also be visualized from the GPR profiles. The architecture suggests the formation of this complex due to a combined process of eastward littoral drift of locally derived sediments and its onshore deposition by storms and eolian activities.</p>

				<title>Occurrence of volcanic ash in the Quaternary alluvial deposits, lower Narmada basin, western India </title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0041-0048</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This communication reports the occurrence of an ash layer intercalated within the late Quaternary alluvial succession of the Madhumati River, a tributary of the lower Narmada River. Petrographic, morphological and chemical details of glass shards and pumice fragments have formed the basis of this study. The ash has been correlated with the Youngest Toba Tuff. The finding of ash layer interbedded in Quaternary alluvial sequences of western Indian continental margin is significant, as ash being datable material, a near precise time-controlled stratigraphy can be interpreted for the Quaternary sediments of western India. The distant volcanic source of this ash requires a fresh re-assessment of ash volume and palaeoclimatic interpretations.</p>

				<title>Identification of major sources controlling groundwater chemistry from a hard rockterrain â A case study from Mettur taluk, Salem district, Tamil Nadu, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0049-0058</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study area Mettur forms an important industrial town situated NW of Salem district. The geology of the area is mainly composed of Archean crystalline metamorphic complexes. To identify the major process activated for controlling the groundwater chemistry an attempt has been made by collecting a total of 46 groundwater samples for two different seasons, viz., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. The groundwater chemistry is dominated by silicate weathering and (Na + Mg) and ($Cl + SO_4$) accounts of about 90% of cations and anions. The contribution of (Ca +Mg) and (Na + K) to total cations and $HCO_3$ indicates the domination of silicate weathering as major sources for cations. The plot for Na to Cl indicates higher Cl in both seasons, derived from Anthropogenic (human) sources from fertilizer, road salt, human and animal waste, and industrial applications, minor representations of Na also indicates source from weathering of silicate-bearing minerals. The plot for Na/Cl to EC indicates Na released from silicate weathering process which is also supported by higher $HCO_3$ values in both the seasons. Ion exchange process is also activated in the study area which is indicated by shifting to right in plot for Ca +Mg to $SO_{4} + HCO_{3}$. The plot of Na â Cl to Ca +Mg â $HCO_3$ â $SO_4$ confirms that Ca, Mg and Na concentrations in groundwater are derived from aquifer materials. Thermodynamic plot indicates that groundwater is in equilibrium with kaolinite, muscovite and chlorite minerals. Saturation index of silicate and carbonate minerals indicate oversaturation during pre-monsoon and undersaturation during post-monsoon, conforming dissolution and dilution process. In general, water chemistry is guided by complex weathering process, ion exchange along with influence of Cl ions from anthropogenic impact.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of karstic aquifers contribution to streams by the statistical analysis of recession curves</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0059-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Karstic aquifers significantly contribute to streams in most of Turkeyâs river basins, so studies on karst water resources have great importance for Turkey. Karstic aquifer contributions are generally emerging at several locations near the river bed and are not readily measured by direct hydrometric methods. In this study, the extent of karstic aquifer contributions to a stream will be investigated by the statistical analysis of recession coefficients of recession curves. Six stream gauging stations on different streams in the western Mediterranean region of Turkey are selected. Recession periods of the streams are simulated by exponential and quadratic recession curve models. Recession coefficient series of the stream gauging stations are statistically investigated. The comparison of various statistical parameters shows that the recession coefficient series are fairly related to the karstic aquifer contributions. Especially, the measure of spread parameters, standard deviation and interquartile range of recession coefficient series are related to the extent of the karstic aquifer contributions to streams.</p>

				<title>Implications of KaliâHindon inter-stream aquifer water balance for groundwater management in western Uttar Pradesh</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0069-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The KaliâHindon inter-stream region extends over an area of 395 $km^2$ within the GangaâYamuna interfluve. It is a fertile tract for sugarcane cultivation. Groundwater is a primary resource for irrigation and industrial purposes. In recent years, over-exploitation has resulted in an adverse impact on the groundwater regime. In this study, an attempt has been made to calculate a water balance for the KaliâHindon inter-stream region. Various inflows and outflows to and from the aquifer have been calculated. The recharge due to rainfall and other recharge parameters such as horizontal inflow, irrigation return flow and canal seepage were also evaluated. Groundwater withdrawals, evaporation from the water table, discharge from the aquifer to rivers and horizontal subsurface outflows were also estimated. The results show that total recharge into the system is 148.72million cubic metres (Mcum), whereas the total discharge is 161.06 Mcum, leaving a deficit balance of â12.34Mcum. Similarly, the groundwater balance was evaluated for the successive four years. The result shows that the groundwater balance is highly sensitive to variation in rainfall followed by draft through pumpage. The depths to water level are shallow in the canal-irrigated northern part of the basin and deeper in the southern part. The pre-monsoon and post-monsoon water levels range from 4.6 to 17.7m below ground level (bgl) and from 3.5 to 16.5m bgl respectively. It is concluded that the groundwater may be pumped in the canal-irrigated northern part, while withdrawals may be restricted to the southern portion of the basin, where intense abstraction has led to rapidly falling water table levels.</p>

				<title>Low level of stratospheric ozone near the Jharia coal field in India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0079-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian reserve of coking coal is mainly located in the Jharia coal field in Jharkhand. Although air pollution due to oxides and dioxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur is reported to have increased in this area due to large-scale opencast mining and coal fires, no significant study on the possible impact of coal fires on the stratospheric ozone concentration has been reported so far. The possible impact of coal fires, which have been burning for more than 90 years on the current stratospheric ozone concentration has been investigated using satellite based data obtained from Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS MLS), Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder (EOS MLS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) in this paper. The stratospheric ozone values for the years 1992â2007, in the 28â36 km altitude range near Jharia and places to its north are found to be consistently lower than those of places lying to its south (up to a radius of 1000 km around Jharia) by 4.0â20%. This low stratospheric ozone level around Jharia is being observed and reported for the first time. However, due to lack of systematic ground-based measurements of tropospheric ozone and vertical ozone profiles at Jharia and other far off places in different directions, it is difficult to conclude strongly on the existence of a relationship between pollution from coal fires and stratospheric ozone depletion.</p>

				<title>Impact of aerosols from the Asian Continent on the adjoining oceanic environments</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0083-0102</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 630nm wavelength over the oceanic regions adjoining the Asian Continent is examined using a seven-year long data base derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board NOAA satellite to study the mean spatial and temporal variations as well as to understand the impact of aerosols advecting from the continent. Depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions and nature of synoptic circulation, the AOD over the oceanic region shows a systematic annual variation. This annual pattern inturn also shows an inter-annual variability because of the corresponding variations in the meteorological features over the continent as well as small-scale deviations in the nature of synoptic circulation. The annual variation over the oceanic regions also shows a pronounced spatial heterogeneity depending on the influence of continental aerosols. Making use of the wind speed dependence of sea-salt AOD at far-oceanic environments and monthly mean wind speeds at small grids of size $5^\circ \times 5^\circ $, the annual variation of sea-salt AOD at different locations is studied to understand the spatial heterogeneity of this component. The residual component obtained by subtracting this from the measured AOD is the non-oceanic component due to advection from continent. The source regions for major continental advections are delineated from the analysis of air-mass back trajectories at appropriate locations identified from the annual pattern of non-oceanic component. The long-term effect of the continental impact is examined from the mean trend of AOD over the three major oceanic regions. This study shows that the continental influence is most significant over the Arabian Sea, followed by the Bay of Bengal and is almost insignificant in most of the regions over the Southern Hemispheric Indian Ocean, except for the effect of smoke aerosols over a few locations near Indonesia and Madagascar.</p>

				<title>Finite element modelling of elastic intraplate stresses due to heterogeneities in crustal density and mechanical properties for the Jabalpur earthquake region, central India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0103-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deep lower crustal intraplate earthquakes are infrequent and the mechanism of their occurrence is not well understood. The NarmadaâSon-lineament region in central India has experienced two such events, the 1938 Satpura earthquake and the 1997 Jabalpur earthquake, having a focal depth of more than 35 km. We have estimated elastic stresses due to the crustal density and mechanical properties heterogeneities along the HirapurâMandla profile passing through the Jabalpur earthquake region to analyse conditions suitable for the concentration of shear stresses in the hypocentral region of this earthquake. Elastic stresses have been computed by a finite element method for a range of material parameters. The results indicate that the shear stresses generated by the density heterogeneities alone are not able to locally enhance the stress concentration in the hypocentral region. The role of mechanical properties of various crustal layers is important in achieving this localization of stresses. Among a range of material parameters analysed, the model with a mechanically strong lower crust overlying a relatively weak sub-Moho layer is able to enhance the stress concentration in the hypocentral region, implying a weaker mantle in comparison to the lower crust for this region of central India.</p>

				<title>Relationship between chemical composition and magnetic susceptibility in sediment   cores from Central Indian Ocean Basin</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0113-0119</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three sediment cores in a northâsouth transect ($3^\circ N to 13^\circ S$) from different sediment types of the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB) are studied to understand the possible relationship between magnetic susceptibility ($\chi $) and Al, Fe, Ti and Mn concentrations. The calcareous ooze core exhibit lowest $\chi $ ($12.32 \times 10^{-7} m^{3} kg^{â1}$), Al (2.84%), Fe (1.63%) and Ti (0.14%), terrigenous clay core with moderate $\chi $ ($29.9 \times 10^{-7} m^{3} kg^{â1}$) but highest Al (6.84%), Fe (5.20%) and Ti (0.44%), and siliceous ooze core with highest $\chi $ ($38.06 \times 10^{-7} m^{3} kg^{â1}$) but moderate Al (4.49%), Fe (2.80%) and Ti (0.19%) contents. The distribution of $\chi $ and detrital proxy elements (Al, Fe, and Ti)  are identical in both calcareous and siliceous ooze. Interestingly, in terrigenous core, the behaviour of $\chi $ is identical to only Ti content but not with Al and Fe suggesting possibility of Al and Fe having a non-detrital source.</p>
					<p>The occurrence of phillipsite in terrigenous clay is evident by the Al-K scatter plot where trend line intersects K axis at more than 50% of total K suggesting excess K in the form of phillipsite. Therefore, the presence of phillipsite might be responsible for negative correlation between $\chi $ and Al (\textit {r} = â0.52). In siliceous ooze the strong positive correlations among $\chi $, Alexc and Feexc suggest the presence of authigenic Fe-rich smectite. High Mn content (0.5%) probably in the form of manganese micronodules is also contributing to $\chi $ in both calcareous and siliceous ooze but not in the terrigenous core where mean Mn content (0.1%) is similar to crustal abundance. Thus, $\chi $ systematically records the terrigenous variation in both the biogenic sediments but in terrigenous clay it indirectly suggests the presence of authigenic minerals.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of coal bed methane potential of coal seams of Sawang Colliery, Jharkhand, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0121-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The coal seams of Sawang Colliery, East Bokaro Coalfields are bituminous to sub-bituminous in nature and categorized as high gaseous seams (degree II to degree III level). These seams have the potential for coal bed methane (CBM) and their maturity increases with increasing depth, as a result of enhanced pressure-temperature conditions in the underground. The vitrinite maceral group composition of the investigated coal seams ranges from 62.50-83.15%, whereas the inertinite content varies from 14.93-36.81%. The liptinite content varies from 0.66% to 3.09%. The maximum micro-pores are confined within the vitrinite group of macerals. The coal seams exhibit vitrinite reflectance values (Ro% calculated) from 0.94% (sample CG-97) to 1.21% (sample CG-119).</p>
					<p>Proximate analyses of the investigated coal samples reveal that the moisture content (M%) ranges from 1.28% to 2.98%, whereas, volatile matter (VM%) content is placed in the range of  27.01% to 33.86%. The ash content (A%) ranges from 10.92% to 30.01%. Fixed carbon (FC%) content varies from 41.53% to 55.93%. Fuel ratio variation shows a restricted range from 1.53 to 1.97. All the coal samples were found to be strongly caking and forming coke buttons.</p>
					<p>The present study is based on the adsorption isotherm experiments carried out under controlled \textit {P-T} conditions for determination of actual gas adsorption capacity of the coal seams. This analysis shows that the maximum methane gas adsorbed in the coal sample CG-81 is 17m3/t (Std. daf), at maximum pressure of 5.92MPa and experimental temperature of $30^\circ C$. The calculated Langmuir regression parameters $P_L$ and $V_L$ range from 2.49 to 3.75MPa and 22.94 to 26.88m3/t (Std. daf), respectively.</p>

				<title>Integrated approach for identification of potential groundwater zones in Seethanagaram Mandal of Vizianagaram District, Andhra Pradesh, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0133-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Identifying a good site for groundwater exploration in hard rock terrain is a challenging task. In hard rocks, groundwater occurs in secondary porosity developed due to weathering, fracturing, faulting, etc., which is highly variable within short distance and contributing to near-surface inhomogeneity. In such situations topographic, hydrogeological and geomorphological features provide useful clues for the selection of suitable sites.</p>
					<p>Initially, based on satellite imagery, topographical, geomorphological and hydrogeological features, an area of about $149 km^2$ was demarcated as a promising zone for groundwater exploration in the hard rock tract of Seethanagaram Mandal, Vizianagaram District, Andhra Pradesh, India. A total of 50 Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) were carried out using Wenner electrode configuration. An interactive interpretation of the VES data sharpened the information inferred from  geomorphological and hydrogeological reconnaissance. Ten sites were recommended for drilling. Drilling with Down-The-Hole Hammer (DTH) was carried out at the recommended sites down to 50 to 70m depths. The interpreted VES results matched well with the drilled bore well lithologs. The yields of bore wells vary from 900 to 9000 liters per hour (lph).</p>

				<title>An application of artificial intelligence for rainfallârunoff modeling</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0145-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study proposes an application of two techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) for rainfallârunoff modeling: the artificial neural networks (ANN) and the evolutionary computation (EC). Two different ANN techniques, the feed forward back propagation (FFBP) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) methods are compared with one EC method, Gene Expression Programming (GEP) which is a new evolutionary algorithm that evolves computer programs. The daily hydrometeorological data of three rainfall stations and one streamflow station for Juniata River Basin in Pennsylvania state of USA are taken into consideration in the model development. Statistical parameters such as average, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, minimum and maximum values, as well as criteria such as mean square error (MSE) and determination coefficient \textit {(R^2)} are used to measure the performance of the models. The results indicate that the proposed genetic programming (GP) formulation performs quite well compared to results obtained by ANNs and is quite practical for use. It is concluded from the results that GEP can be proposed as an alternative to ANN models.</p>

				<title>A Statistical Cyclone Intensity Prediction (SCIP) model for the Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0157-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A statistical model for predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal has been proposed. The model is developed applying multiple linear regression technique. The model parameters are determined from the database of 62 cyclones that developed over the Bay of Bengal during the period 1981â2000. The parameters selected as predictors are: initial storm intensity, intensity changes during past 12 hours, storm motion speed, initial storm latitude position, vertical wind shear averaged along the storm track, vorticity at 850 hPa, Divergence at 200 hPa and sea surface temperature (SST). When the model is tested with the dependent samples of 62 cyclones, the forecast skill of the model for forecasts up to 72 hours is found to be reasonably good. The average absolute errors (AAE) are less than 10 knots for forecasts up to 36 hours and maximum forecast error of order 14 knots occurs at 60 hours and 72 hours. When the model is tested with the independent samples of 15 cyclones (during 2000 to 2007), the AAE is found to be less than 13 knots (ranging from 5.1 to 12.5 knots) for forecast up to 72 hours. The model is found to be superior to the empirical model proposed by Roy Bhowmik et al (2007) for the Bay of Bengal.</p>

				<title>North Indian Ocean warming and sea level rise in an OGCM</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0169-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The variability in the long-term temperature and sea level over the north Indian Ocean during the period 1958â2000 has been investigated using an Ocean General Circulation Model, Modular Ocean Model version 4. The model simulated fields are compared with the sea level observations from tide-gauges, Topex/Poseidon (T/P) satellite, \textit {in situ} temperature profile observations from WHOI moored buoy and sea surface temperature (SST) observations from DS1, DS3 and DS4 moored buoys. It is seen that the long (6â8 years) warming episodes in the SST over the north Indian Ocean are followed by short episodes (2â3 years) of cooling. The model temperature and sea level anomaly over the north Indian Ocean show an increasing trend in the study period. The model thermocline heat content per unit area shows a linear increasing trend (from 1958â2000) at the rate of $0.0018 \times 10^{11} J/m^{2}$ per year for north Indian Ocean. North Indian Ocean sea level anomaly (thermosteric component) also shows a linear increasing trend of 0.31mm/year during 1958â2000.</p>

				<title>Active fault traces along Bhuj Fault and Katrol Hill Fault, and trenching survey at Wandhay, Kachchh, Gujarat, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0181-0188</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several new active fault traces were identiï¬ed along Katrol Hill Fault (KHF).A new fault (named as Bhuj Fault,BF)that extends into the Bhuj Plain was also identiï¬ed.These fault traces were identiï¬ed based on satellite photo interpretation and ï¬eld survey.Trenches were excavated to identify the paleoseismic events,pattern of faulting and the nature of deformation.New active fault traces were recognized about 1 km north of the topographic boundary between the Katrol Hill and the plain area.The fault exposure along the left bank of Khari River with 10 m wide shear zone in the Mesozoic rocks and showing displacement of the overlying Quaternary deposits is indicative of continued tectonic activity along the ancient fault.The E-W trending active fault traces along the KHF in the western part changes to NE-SW or ENE-WSW near Wandhay village.</p>
					<p>Trenching survey across a low scarp near Wandhay village reveals three major fault strands F1, F2,and F3.These fault strands displaced the older terrace deposits comprising Sand,Silt and Gravel units along with overlying younger deposits from units 1 to 5 made of gravel,sand and silt.  Stratigraphic relationship indicates at least three large magnitude earthquakes along KHF during Late Holocene or recent historic past.</p>

				<title>Magnetotelluric investigations for imaging electrical structure of Garhwal Himalayan corridor, Uttarakhand, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0189-0200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Magnetotelluric investigations have been carried out in the Garhwal Himalayan corridor to delineate the electrical structure of the crust along a proï¬le extending from Indo-Gangetic Plain to Higher Himalayan region in Uttarakhand,India.The proï¬le passing through major Himalayan thrusts:Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFF),Main Boundary Thrust (MBT)and Main Central Thrust (MCT),is nearly perpendicular to the regional geological strike.Data processing and impedance analysis indicate that out of 44 stations MT data recorded,only 27 stations data show in general,the validity of 2D assumption.The average geoelectric strike, $N70^\circ W$, was estimated for the proï¬le using tensor decomposition.2D smooth geoelectrical model has been presented,which provides the electrical image of the shallow and deeper crustal structure.The major features of the model are (i)a low resistivity (&mt; $50\Omega m$),shallow feature interpreted as sediments of Siwalik and Indo-Gangetic Plain,(ii)highly resistive (&lt; $1000\Omega m$)zone below the sediments at a depth of 6 km,interpreted as the top surface of the Indian plate,(iii)a low resistivity (&mt; 10\Omega m$) below the depth of 6 km near MCT zone coincides with the intense micro-seismic activity in the region. The zone is interpreted as the partial melting or ï¬uid phase at mid crustal depth.Sensitivity test indicates that the major features of the geoelectrical model are relevant and desired by the MT data.</p>

				<title>Paleosol at the ArcheanâProterozoic contact in NW India revisited â Evidence for oxidizing conditions during paleo-weathering?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0201-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A number of ï¬ne-grained sericite bearing pelitic,schistose lithologies occur along the Archean (Banded Gneiss Complex)âProterozoic  (Aravalli Supergroup)contact (APC)in the Udaipur valley in NW Indian craton.These Al-rich lithologies (subsequently metamorphosed)have been described as âpaleosols â,developed over a 3.3 Ga old Archean gneissic basement and are overlain by Paleopro- terozoic Aravalli quartzite.The paleosol was developed between 2.5 and 2.1,coincident with the globally recognized Great Oxidation Event (GOE).In previous studies these paleosol sections were interpreted to have developed under reducing environment,however,the ï¬nding of a âferricrete â zone in the upper part of Tulsi Namla section (east of Udaipur)during the present study (in addition to earlier reported lithologies) has  led to an alternative suggestion of oxygen-rich conditions during paleosol development.The Tulsi Namla paleosol section shows all the features characteristic of a complete paleosol section described from other Archean cratons.The paleosol includes sericite schist with kyanite as the prevalent Al-silicate in the lower part of proï¬le while chloritoid and Fe-oxides typify the Fe-rich upper part.Alumina has remained immobile during the weathering process while Fe and Mn show a decrease in the lower part of the section and an abrupt rise in the upper part,in the ferricrete zone.The ï¬eld and geochemical data indicate that the Tulsi Namla section is an \textit {in situ} weathering proï¬le and at least the upper part shows evidence of oxidizing conditions.</p>

				<title>Seasonal variation in biomass and species composition of seaweeds stranded along Port Okha, northwest coast of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0211-0218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Port Okha coast,which is known for its luxuriant growth of a diverse assemblage of seaweeds on Saurashtra coast,is found to have abundant quantities of seaweeds being drifted and washed ashore every year.Studies conducted for quantifying the stranded seaweeds from May 2004 to April 2005 showed an average biomass value of 3.10 kg fresh wt/$m^{2}$/month with maximum being 6.60 kg fresh wt/$m^{2}$ in April.The stranded weeds constituted a total of 62 species during the entire study period.Of this,Rhodophyta ranked high with 26 species followed by Chlorophyta with 22 species and Phaeophyta with 14 species.The stranded seaweeds that were washed ashore provide valuable ï¬oristic information about the intertidal and near shore sub-tidal algae of the respective regions.Although natural senescence of seaweeds is one of the major factors,strong currents primarily forced by tides,also contribute to the uprooting and subsequent drifting of seaweeds on to the beach.This ultimately causes changes in ï¬oristic features of the existing algal beds.</p>

					<p>In this paper,we report observations of unusual whistlers recorded at Jammu (geomag.lat.= $22^\circ 26^\prime N$; \textit {L} =1 .17),India on March 8,1999 during the daytime.They are interpreted as one-hop ducted whistlers having propagated along higher \textit {L} -values in closely spaced narrow ducts from the opposite hemispheres.After leakage from the duct,the waves might have propagated in the earthionosphere waveguide towards the equator in surface mode.Tentative explanation of the dynamic spectra of these events is brieï¬y presented.</p>

					<p>The inï¬uence of temperature on tropospheric ozone ($O_3$)concentrations in urban and photochemically polluted areas in the greater Athens region are investigated in the present study.Hourly values of the ambient air temperature used for studying the urban heat island effect in Athens were recorded at twenty-three experimental stations while ozone concentration values were measured at three of the above-mentioned stations and for a period of two years (1996 â1997).The linear correlation between ozone concentration and air temperature values as well as the temporal variation of temperature and ozone concentration,for the above-mentioned experimental stations, were calculated and analysed.Moreover,a neural network approach was used for investigating the impact of temperature on the ozone concentration values over the greater Athens area.The neural network model used ambient air temperature as one of its input parameters and it was found that temperature is a predominant parameter,affecting considerably the ozone concentration values.</p>

				<page>0237-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Some recent analyses of India âs water budget are based on information attributed to the Ministry of Water Resources.An examination of the budget components indicates that they imply an evapotranspiration estimate that is signiï¬cantly lower than what one may expect based on information from other sources.If such is the case,India âs water resources situation may be more dire than is otherwise perceived.For,higher evapotranspiration implies correspondingly reduced availability of water for human use.It should be worthwhile to investigate and reconcile the apparent discrepancy between water budget and evapotranspiration,considering the importance of water in the national context.</p>

				<title>Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB): An overview</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0243-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During MarchâMay 2006, an extensive, multi-institution, multi-instrument, and multi-platform integrated field experiment âIntegrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budgetâ (ICARB) was carried out under the Geosphere Biosphere Programme of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO-GBP). The objective of this largest and most exhaustive field campaign, ever conducted in the Indian region, was to characterize the physico-chemical properties and radiative effects of atmospheric aerosols and trace gases over the Indian landmass and the adjoining oceanic regions of the Arabian Sea, northern Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal through intensive, simultaneous observations. A network of ground-based observatories (over the mainland and islands), a dedicated ship cruise over the oceanic regions using a fully equipped research vessel, the \textit {Sagar Kanya}, and altitude profiling over selected regions using an instrumented aircraft and balloonsondes formed the three segments of this integrated experiment, which were carried out in tandem. This paper presents an overview of the ICARB field experiment, the database generated, and some of its interesting outcomes though these are preliminary in nature.</p>
					<p>The ICARB has revealed significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity in most of the aerosol characteristics both over land and ocean. Observed aerosol loading and optical depths were comparable to or in certain regions, a little lower than those reported in some of the earlier campaigns for these regions. The preliminary results indicate:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>low (&mt; 0.2) aerosol optical depths (AOD) over most part of the Arabian Sea, except two pockets; one off Mangalore and the other, less intense, in the central Arabian Sea at $\sim 18^\circ N$ latitude;</li>
						<li>High ËAngstr$\ddot{o} $m exponent in the southern Arabian Sea signifying steep AOD spectra and higher abundance of accumulation mode particles in the southern Arabian Sea and off Mangalore;</li>
						<li>Remarkably low ËAngstr$\ddot{o} $m exponents signifying increased concentration of coarse mode aerosols and high columnar abundance in the northern Arabian Sea;</li>
						<li>Altitude profiles from aircraft showed a steady BC level up to 3 km altitude with structures which were associated with inversions in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL);</li>
						<li>A surprisingly large increase in the BC mass fraction with altitude;</li>

				<title>Aircraft measurements of aerosol black carbon from a coastal location in the north-east part of peninsular India during ICARB</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0263-0271</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB) over India, high-resolution airborne measurements of the altitude profiles of the mass concentrations ($M_B$) of aerosol black carbon (BC) were made off Bhubaneswar (BBR, $85.82^\circ E, 20.25^\circ N$), over northwest Bay of Bengal, in the altitude region upto 3 km. Such high-resolution measurements of altitude profiles of aerosols are done for the first time over India. The profiles showed a near-steady vertical distribution of $M_B$ modulated with two small peaks, one at 800m and the other at $\sim 2000m$. High resolution GPS (Global Positioning System) sonde (Vaisala) measurements around the same region onboard the research vessel \textit {Sagar Kanya} (around the same time of the aircraft sortie) revealed two convectively well mixed layers, one from ground to $\sim 700m$ with an inversion at the top and the other extends from 1200m to $\sim 2000m$ with a second inversion at $\sim 2200m$ and a convectively stable region in the altitude range 700â1200m. The observed peaks in the $M_B$ profile are found to be associated with these temperature inversions. In addition, long-range transport from the Indo- Gangetic Plain (IGP) and deserts lying further to the west also influence the vertical profile of BC. Latitudinal variation of $M_B$ showed a remarkable land ocean contrast at the 500m altitude (within the well mixed region) with remarkably lower values over oceans, suggesting the impact of strong sources over the mainland. However, above the ABL (at 1500m), the latitudinal variations were quite weak, and this appears to be resulting from the impact of long-range transport. Comparison of the altitude profiles of $M_B$ over BoB off BBR with those obtained during the earlier occasion over the inland stations of Hyderabad and Kanpur showed similarities above $\sim 500m$, with MB remaining around a steady value of $\sim 1 \mu g m^{â3}$. However, large differences are seen within the ABL. Even though the observed $M_B$ values are not unusually high, their near constancy in the vertical column will have important implications to radiative forcing.</p>

				<title>Airborne measurements of submicron aerosols across the coastline at Bhubaneswar during ICARB</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0273-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Airborne measurements of the number concentration and size distribution of aerosols from 13 to 700 nm diameter have been made at four vertical levels across a coastline at Bhubaneswar ($20^\circ 25^\prime N, 85^\circ 83^\prime E$) during the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB) programme conducted in MarchâApril 2006. The measurements made during the constant-level flights at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 km altitude levels extend $\sim 100$ km over land and $\sim 150km$ over ocean. Aerosol number concentrations vary from 2200 to 4500 $cm^{â3}$ at 0.5 km level but are almost constant at $\sim 6000 cm^{â3}$ and $\sim 800 cm^{â3}$ at 2 and 3 km levels, respectively. At 1km level, aerosol number concentration shows a peak of 18,070 $cm^{â3}$ around the coastline. Most of the aerosol size distribution curves at 0.5 km and 1 km levels are monomodal with a maxima at 110nm diameter which shifts to 70 nm diameter at 2 and 3 km levels. However, at the peak at 1 km level, number concentration has a bimodal distribution with an additional maximum appearing in nucleation mode. It is proposed that this maxima in nucleation mode at 1 km level may be due to the formation and transport of new particles from coastal regions.</p>

				<title>Lidar observation of aerosol stratification in the lower troposphere over Pune during pre-monsoon season of 2006</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0293-0302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lidar observations of aerosol vertical distributions in the lower troposphere along with observations of horizontal and vertical winds from collocated UHF radar (Wind Profiler) over a tropical Indian station, Pune during the pre-monsoon season (MarchâMay) of 2006 as part of an ISRO-GBP national campaign (ICARB) have been examined. Lidar vertical profiles showed high aerosol concentrations in the surface layers and a subsequent gradual decrease with height. Results showed the presence of an elevated stratified aerosol layer around 2000â3500m height which persisted throughout the months of March and April. Observed strong vertical gradients in both horizontal and vertical winds in the lower troposphere seem to be a possible cause for the formation of elevated aerosol layers. Further, high daytime temperatures accompanied by dry conditions at the surface help to enhance the aerosol loading in the lower layers over this location.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of spectral aerosol optical depths over India during ICARB</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0303-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements, carried out regularly from a network of observatories spread over the Indian mainland and adjoining islands in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, are used to examine the spatio-temporal and spectral variations during the period of ICARB (March to May 2006). The AODs and the derived ËAngstr$\ddot{o} $m parameters showed considerable variations across India during the above period. While at the southern peninsular stations the AODs decreased towards May after a peak in April, in the north Indian regions they increased continuously from March to May. The ËAngstr$\ddot{o} $m coefficients suggested enhanced coarse mode loading in the north Indian regions, compared to southern India. Nevertheless, as months progressed from March to May, the dominance of coarse mode aerosols increased in the columnar aerosol size spectrum over the entire Indian mainland, maintaining the regional distinctiveness. Compared to the above, the island stations showed considerably low AODs, so too the northeastern station Dibrugarh, indicating the prevalence of cleaner environment. Long-range transport of aerosols from the adjoining regions leads to remarkable changes in the magnitude of the AODs and their wavelength dependencies during March to May. HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis shows that enhanced long-range transport of aerosols, particularly from the west Asia and northwest coastal India, contributed significantly to the enhancement of AOD and in the flattening of the spectra over entire regions; if it is the peninsular regions and the island Minicoy are more impacted in April, the north Indian regions including the Indo Gangetic Plain get affected the most during May, with the AODs soaring as high as 1.0 at 500 nm. Over the islands, the ËAngstr$\ddot{o} $m exponent ($\alpha $) remained significantly lower ($\sim 1$) over the Arabian Sea compared to Bay of Bengal (BoB) ($\sim 1.4$) as revealed by the data respectively from Minicoy and Port Blair. Occurrences of higher values of $\alpha $, showing dominance of accumulation mode aerosols, over BoB are associated well with the advection, above the boundary layer, of fine particles from the east Asian region during March and April. The change in the airmass to marine in May results in a rapid decrease in $\alpha $ over the BoB.</p>

				<title>Size segregated aerosol mass concentration measurements over the Arabian Sea during ICARB</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0315-0323</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mass concentration and mass size distribution of total (composite) aerosols near the surface are essential inputs needed in developing aerosol models for radiative forcing estimation as well as to infer the environment and air quality. Using extensive measurements onboard the oceanographic research vessel, \textit {Sagar Kanya}, during its cruise SK223B in the second phase of the ocean segment of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB), the spatial distribution of the mass concentration and mass size distribution of near-surface aerosols are examined for the first time over the entire Arabian Sea, going as far as $58^\circ E$ and $22^\circ N$, within a span of 26 days. In general, the mass concentrations \textit {(M_T)} were found to be low with the mean value for the entire Arabian Sea being $16.7 \pm 7\mu g m^{â3}$; almost 1/2 of the values reported in some of the earlier campaigns. Coarse mode aerosols contributed, on an average, 58% to the  total mass, even though at a few pockets accumulation mode contribution dominated. Spatially, significant variations were observed over central and northern Arabian Sea as well as close to the west coast of India. In central Arabian Sea, even though the \textit {M_T} was quite low, contribution  of accumulation aerosols to the total mass concentration was greater than 50%. Effective radius, a parameter important in determining scattering properties of aerosol size distribution, varied between 0.07 and $0.4 \mu m$ with a mean value of $0.2 \mu m$. Number size distributions, deduced from the mass size distributions, were approximated to inverse power-law form and the size indices ($\upsilon $) were estimated. It was found to vary in the range 3.9 to 4.2 with a mean value of 4.0 for the entire oceanic region. Extinction coefficients, estimated using the number-size distributions, were well-correlated with the  accumulation mode mass concentration with a correlation coefficient of 0.82.</p>

					<p>The chemical composition of aerosols in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) of Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Arabian Sea (AS) has been studied during the spring and inter-monsoon (MarchâMay 2006) based on the analysis of water soluble constituents ($Na^{+}, NH^{+}_{4}, K^{+}, Mg^{2+}, Ca^{2+}, Cl^{â}, NO^{â}_{3}$ and $SO^{2â}_{4}$), crustal elements (Al, Fe, and Ca) and carbonaceous species (EC, OC). The total suspended particulates (TSP) ranged from 5.2 to 46.6 $\mu g m^{â3}$ and 8.2 to 46.9 $\mu g m^{â3}$ during the sampling transects in the BoB and AS respectively. The water-soluble species, on average, accounted for 44% and 33% of TSP over BoB and AS respectively, with dominant contribution of $SO^{2â}_{4}$ over both the oceanic regions. However, distinct differences with respect to elevated abundances of $NH^{+}_{4}$ in the MABL of BoB and that of $Na^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$ in AS are clearly evident. The non-sea-salt component of $SO^{2â}_{4} ranging from 82 to 98% over BoB and 35 to 98% over AS; together with $nss-Ca^{2+}/nss-SO^{2â}_{4}$ equivalent ratios 0.12 to 0.5 and 0.2 to 1.16, respectively, provide evidence for the predominance of anthropogenic constituents and chemical transformation processes occurring within MABL. The concentrations of OC and EC average around 1.9 and $0.4 \mu g m^{â3}$ in BoB and exhibit a decreasing trend from north to south; however, abundance of these carbonaceous species are not significantly pronounced over AS. The abundance of Al, used as a proxy for mineral aerosols, varied from 0.2 to 1.9 $\mu g m^{â3}$ over BoB and AS, with a distinctly different spatial pattern â decreasing north to south in BoB in contrast to an increasing pattern in the Arabian Sea.</p>

				<title>Aerosol mass loading over the marine environment of Arabian Sea during ICARB: Sea-salt and non-sea-salt components</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0333-0344</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mass loading and chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols over the Arabian Sea during the pre-monsoon months of April and May have been studied as a part of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB). These investigations show large spatial variabilities in total aerosol mass loading as well as that of individual chemical species. The mass loading is found to vary between 3.5 and $69.2 \mu g m^{â3}$, with higher loadings near the eastern and northern parts of Arabian Sea, which decreases steadily to reach its minimum value in the mid Arabian Sea. The decrease in mass loading from the coast of India towards west is estimated to have a linear gradient of 1.53 $\mu g m^{â3}/â¦ $ longitude and an eâ1 scale distance of $\sim 2300 km$. $SO^{2â}_{4}, Cl^{â}$ and $Na^{+}$ are found to be the major ionic species present. Apart from these, other dominating watersoluble components of aerosols are $NO^{â}_{3}$ (17%) and $Ca^{2+}$ (6%). Over the marine environment of Arabian Sea, the non-sea-salt component dominates accounting to $\sim 76%$ of the total aerosol mass. The spatial variations of the various ions are examined in the light of prevailing meteorological conditions and airmass back trajectories.</p>

				<title>Chemical characteristics of $PM_{10} aerosols and airmass trajectories over Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea during ICARB</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0345-0352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For the first time, chemical characterization of $PM_{10}$ aerosols was attempted over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Arabian Sea (AS) during the ICARB campaign. Dominance of $SO^{2â}_{4}, NH^{+}_{4}$ and $NO^{â}_{3}$ was noticed over both the regions which indicated the presence of ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate as major water soluble particles playing a very important role in the radiation budget. It was observed that all the chemical constituents had higher concentrations over Bay of Bengal as compared to Arabian Sea. Higher concentrations were observed near the Indian coast showing influence of landmass indicating that gaseous pollutants like $SO_{2}, NH_{3}$ and $NO_{x}$ are transported over to the sea regions which consequently contribute to higher $SO^{2â}_{4} , NH^{+}_{4}$ and $NO{â}_{3}$ aerosols respectively. The most polluted region over BoB was $13^\circ â19^\circ N$ and $70^\circ â90^\circ E$ while it was near $11^\circ N$ and $75^\circ E$ over AS. Although the concentrations were higher over Bay of Bengal for all the chemical constituents of $PM_{10}$ aerosols, per cent non-sea salt (nss) fraction (with respect to Na) was higher over Arabian Sea. Very low $Ca^{2+}$ concentration was observed at Arabian Sea which led to higher atmospheric acidity as compared to BoB. Nss $SO^{2â}_{4}$ alone contributed 48% of total water soluble fraction over BoB as well as AS. Ratios $SO^{2â}_{4} /NO^{â}_{3}$ over both the regions (7.8 and 9 over BoB and AS respectively) were very high as compared to reported values at land sites like Allahabad (0.63) and Kanpur (0.66) which may be due to very low NOâ3 over sea regions as compared to land sites. Air trajectory analysis showed four classes: (i) airmass passing through Indian land, (ii) from oceanic region, (iii) northern Arabian Sea and Middle East and (iv) African continent. The highest nss $SO^{2â}_{4}$ was observed during airmasses coming from the Indian land side while lowest concentrations were observed when the air was coming from oceanic regions. Moderate concentrations of nss $SO^{2â}_{4}$ were observed when air was seen moving from the Middle East and African continent. The pH of rainwater was observed to be in the range of 5.9â6.5 which is lower than the values reported over land sites. Similar feature was reported over the Indian Ocean during INDOEX indicating that marine atmosphere had more free acidity than land atmosphere.</p>

				<title>Influence of circulation parameters on the AOD variations over the Bay of Bengal during ICARB</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0353-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) level-3 aerosol data, NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis winds and QuikSCAT ocean surface winds were made use of to examine the role of atmospheric circulation in governing aerosol variations over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the first phase of the ICARB (Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget) campaign (March 18âApril 12, 2006). An inter-comparison between MODIS level-3 aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and ship-borne MICROTOPS measurements showed good agreement with correlation 0.92 (\textit {p} &mt; 0.0001) and a mean MODIS underestimation by 0.01. During the study period, the AOD over BoB showed high values in the northern/north western regions, which reduced towards the central and southern BoB. The wind patterns in lower atmospheric layers (&lt; 850 hPa)  indicated that direct transport of aerosols from central India was inhibited by the presence of a high pressure and a divergence over BoB in the lower altitudes. On the other hand, in the upper atmospheric levels, winds from central and northern India stretched south eastwards and converged over BoB with a negative vorticity indicative of a downdraft. These wind patterns pointed to the possibility of aerosol transport from central India to BoB by upper level winds. This mechanism was further confirmed by the significant correlations that AOD variations over BoB showed with aerosol flux convergence and flux vorticity at upper atmospheric levels (600â500 hPa). AOD in central and southern BoB away from continental influences displayed an exponential dependence on the QuikSCAT measured ocean surface wind speed. This study shows that particles transported from central and northern India by upper atmospheric circulations as well as the marine aerosols generated by ocean surface winds contributed to the AOD over the BoB during the first phase of ICARB.</p>

				<title>Analysis of marine aerosol optical depth retrieved from IRS-P4 OCM sensor and comparison with the aerosol derived from SeaWiFS and MODIS sensor</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0361-0373</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aerosol optical depth is regularly derived from SeaWiFS and MODIS sensor and used by the scientific community in various climatic studies. In the present study an attempt has been made to retrieve the aerosol optical depth using the IRS-P4 OCM sensor data and a comparison has been carried out using few representative datasets. The results show that the IRS-P4 OCM retrieved aerosol optical depth is in good agreement with the aerosols retrieved from SeaWiFS as well as MODIS. The RMSE are found to be $\pm 0.0522$ between OCM and SeaWIFS and $\pm 0.0638$ between OCM and MODIS respectively. However, IRS-P4 OCM sensor retrieved aerosol optical depth is closer to SeaWiFS (correlation = 0.88, slope = 0.96 and intercept = â0.013) compared to MODIS (correlation = 0.75, slope = 0.91 and intercept = 0.0198). The mean percentage difference indicates that OCM retrieved AOD is +12% higher compared to SeaWiFS and +8% higher compared to MODIS. The mean absolute percentage between OCM derived AOD and SeaWiFS is found to be less (16%) compared to OCM and MODIS (20%).</p>

				<title>Latitudinal and longitudinal variation in aerosol characteristics from Sun photometer and MODIS over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea during ICARB</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0375-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spatial variations in aerosol optical properties as function of latitude and longitude are analysed over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea during ICARB cruise period of MarchâMay 2006 from \textit {in situ} sun photometer and MODIS (Terra, Aqua) satellite measurements. Monthly mean 550 nm aerosol optical depths (AODs) over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea show an increase from March to May both in spatial extent and magnitude. AODs are found to increase with latitude from $4^\circ N to 20^\circ N$ over the Bay of Bengal while over Arabian Sea, variations are not significant. Sun photometer and MODIS AODs agree well within $\pm 1\sigma $ variation. Bay of Bengal AOD (0.28) is higher than the Arabian Sea (0.24) latitudinally. Aerosol fine mode fraction (FMF) is higher than 0.6 over Bay of Bengal, while FMF in the Arabian Sea is about 0.5. Bay of Bengal $\alpha (\sim 1)$ is higher than the Arabian Sea value of 0.7, suggesting the dominance of fine mode aerosols over Bay of Bengal which is corroborated by higher FMF values over Bay of Bengal. Air back trajectory analyses suggest that aerosols from different source regions contribute differently to the optical characteristics over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea.</p>

				<title>Aerosol characteristics at a remote island: Minicoy in southern Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0389-0397</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extensive measurements of aerosol optical and microphysical properties made at a remote island, Minicoy in southern Arabian Sea for the period (February 2006âMarch 2007) are used to characterize their temporal variability and Black Carbon (BC) mass mixing ratio. Large decrease in aerosol BC (from $\sim 800 ng m^{â3} to \sim 100 ng m^{â3}$) was observed associated with change in airmass characteristics and monsoon rains. The total aerosol mass varied between $\sim 80$ and $20 \mu g m^{â3}$. Though the total mass fell drastically, a slight increase in super micron mass was observed during the JuneâAugust period associated with high winds. The mass fraction of Black Carbon aerosols during the prevalence of continental airmass is found to be $\sim 1.2%$ of the composite aerosols, which is much lower than the values reported earlier for this region.</p>

				<title>Physical and optical characteristics of atmospheric aerosols during ICARB at Manora Peak, Nainital: A sparsely inhabited, high-altitude location in the Himalayas</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0399-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Collocated measurements of the optical and physical properties of columnar and near-surface aerosols were carried out from Manora Peak, Nainital (a sparsely inhabited, high altitude location, $\sim 2km$ above mean sea level, in the Himalayas), during the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB) under the Geosphere Biosphere Programme of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO-GBP). Under this, observational data of spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD), mass concentration of aerosol black carbon (\textit {M_B}), mass concentration (\textit {M_T} ) and number concentration (\textit {N_t}) of composite (total) aerosols near the surface and meteorological parameters were collected during the period February 15 to April 30, 2006. Though very low (&mt; 0.1 at 500 nm) AODs were observed during clear days, as much as a fourfold increase was seen on hazy days. The ËAngstr$\ddot{o} $m exponent ($\alpha $), deduced from the spectral AODs, revealed high values during clear days, while on hazy days $\alpha $ was low; with an overall mean value of $0.69 \pm 0.06$ for the campaign period. BC mass concentration varied between 0.36 and $2.87 \mu g m^{â3}$ and contributed in the range 0.7 to 1.8% to the total aerosol mass. Total aerosol number concentration and BC mass concentration showed diurnal variation with a midnight and early morning minimum and a late afternoon maximum; a pattern quite opposite to that seen in low altitude stations. These are attributed to the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The spectral AOD measurements have been made for the first time over Patiala during multiplatform field campaign ICARBâ2006 using a Multi-Wavelength Radiometer (MWR) along with the suspended particulate matter measurements with a high volume sampler. Spectral AOD has higher values in May in comparison to March and April. The monthly mean AOD values at 500 nm are $0.26 \pm 0.08, 0.36 \pm 0.19$ and $0.58 \pm 0.20$ for the months of March, April and May respectively. The mean AOD is more during afternoon in comparison to forenoon at all wavelengths. The atmospheric turbidity is higher in May and is attributed to dust transported by southerly winds prevailing during this month. The ËAngstr$\ddot{o} $m parameter $\alpha $ varies between zero and 0.68 while $\beta $ ranges from 0.1 to 0.9. The columnar water vapour content ranges from 0.12 to 2.92 cm, having a mean value of $1.06 \pm 0.648$ cm. The mean total suspended particulate matter is $334.41 \pm 97.56 \mu gm/m^{3}$, an indication of high aerosol loading over Patiala during the campaign period.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Continuous and campaign-based aerosol field measurements are essential in understanding fundamental atmospheric aerosol processes and for evaluating their effect on global climate, environment and human life. Synchronous measurements of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Black Carbon (BC) aerosol mass concentration and aerosol particle size distribution were carried out during the campaign period at tropical urban regions of Hyderabad, India. Daily satellite datasets of DMSP-OLS were processed for night-time forest fires over the Indian region in order to understand the additional sources (forest fires) of aerosol. The higher values in black carbon aerosol mass concentration and aerosol optical depth correlated well with forest fires occurring over the region. Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol index (AI) variations showed absorbing aerosols over the region and correlated with ground measurements.</p>

				<title>Temporal characteristics of aerosol physical properties at Visakhapatnam on the east coast of India during ICARB â Signatures of transport onto Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0421-0427</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Realizing the importance of aerosol physical properties at the adjoining continental and coastal locations in the airmass pathways onto the oceanic region, extensive measurements of aerosol physical properties were made at Visakhapatnam ($17.7^\circ N, 83.3^\circ E$), an eastern coastal location in peninsular India during the ICARB period. The temporal variations of aerosol optical depth, near surface aerosol mass size distributions and BC mass concentrations show significantly higher aerosol optical depth and near surface mass concentrations during the first and last weeks of April 2007. The mean BC mass fraction in the fine mode aerosol was around 11%. The aerosol back scatter profiles derived from Micro Pulse Lidar indicate a clear airmass subsidence on the days with higher aerosol optical depths and near surface mass fraction. A comparison of the temporal variation of the aerosol properties at Visakhapatnam with the MODIS derived aerosol optical depth along the cruise locations indicates a resemblance in the temporal variation suggesting that the aerosol transport from the eastern coastal regions of peninsular India could significantly affect the aerosol optical properties at the near coastal oceanic regions and that the affect significantly reduced at the farther regions.</p>

				<title>Role of biology in the airâsea carbon flux in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0429-0447</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A physical-biological-chemical model (PBCM)is used for investigating the seasonal cycle of  air âsea carbon ï¬ux and for assessing  the effect of the biological processes on seasonal time scale in the Arabian Sea (AS)and Bay of Bengal (BoB),where the surface waters are subjected to contrasting physical conditions.The formulation of PBCM is given in Swathi \textit {et al} (2000),and evaluation of several ammonium-inhibited nitrate uptake models is given in Sharada \textit {et al} (2005). The PBCM is here ï¬rst evaluated against JGOFS data on surface $pCO_2$ in AS, Bay of Bengal Process Studies (BoBPS)data on column integrated primary productivity in BoB,and WOCE I1 data on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)and alkalinity (ALK)in the upper 500 meters at $9^\circ N$ in AS and at $10^\circ N$ in BoB in September âOctober.There is good qualitative agreement with local quantitative discrepancies.</p>
					<p>The net effect of biological processes on air âsea carbon ï¬ux on seasonal time scale is determined with an auxiliary computational experiment,called the abiotic run,in which the biological processes are turned off.The difference between the biotic run and abiotic run is interpreted as the net effect of biological processes on the seasonal variability of chemical variables.The net biological effect on air âsea carbon ï¬ux is found to be highest in southwest monsoon season in the northwest AS, where strong upwelling drives intense new production.The biological effect is larger in AS than in BoB,as seasonal upwelling and mixing are strong in AS,especially in the northeast,while coastal upwelling and mixing are weak in BoB.</p>

				<title>Spatial distribution of atmospheric carbon monoxide over Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea: Measurements during pre-monsoon period of 2006</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0449-0455</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)conducted the âIntegrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB)âfor a two-month pre-monsoon period in 2006 with the ocean segment covering Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea.During this campaign,carbon monoxide (CO) was continuously monitored using a non-dispersive IR analyser. Quantifying CO in ambient air is vital in determining the air quality of a region.Being toxic,CO is a criteria pollutant,but it is a weak green house gas.Globally,very few measurements exist over marine atmospheres to study its temporal pattern;particularly \textit {in situ} CO measurements are few over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea for comparison.Present measurements indicate:(i)predominant single peak in the diurnal pattern of CO over the marine atmosphere in contrast to the double peak over the continent, (ii)the mean diurnal CO over the marine atmosphere showing an increasing trend towards evening hours,(iii)the amplitude of the AN peaks over the marine atmosphere was $\sim 100$ ppbv,while at a remote island site in the Indian Ocean it was $\sim 5$ ppbv and (iv)high CO values were observed close to continent and the long range transport by wind also caused CO highs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Prediction of wind speed in the atmospheric boundary layer is important for wind energy assess- ment,satellite launching and aviation,etc.There are a few techniques available for wind speed prediction,which require a minimum number of input parameters.Four different statistical techniques,viz.,curve ï¬tting,Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA),extrapolation with periodic function and Artiï¬cial Neural Networks (ANN)are employed to predict wind speed.These methods require wind speeds of previous hours as input.It has been found that wind speed can be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy using two methods,viz.,extrapolation using periodic curve ï¬tting and ANN and the other two methods are not very useful.</p>

				<title>Dependence of thermal conductivity of snow on microstructure</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0465-0475</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A geometrical model,including different geometrical shapes in ï¬uencing thermal conductivity of snow is proposed.The geometrical model has been assumed to comprise of unit cells having solid (ice)inclusion as an aggregation of spherical,cylindrical or cubical shapes with vertical connection, arranged in a cubic packing.From the geometrical model and one-dimensional heat transfer theory, the effective thermal conductivity has been computed.For this purpose,coupled one-dimensional heat transfer equations have been solved for steady-state condition to account for conduction in ice, conduction in air and latent heat transfer due to water vapour sublimation through air.The model demonstrates the dependency of thermal conductivity on density,grain-spacing,grain contact ratio and temperature.Spherical inclusions give highest conductivity while cubical inclusion estimates lowest value for the same density.Thermal conductivity has been found increasing sharply near to the packing density for all three shapes.Empirical model results and results obtained from existing microstructure based models have also been compared with the present model.</p>

				<title>Simultaneous transport of water and solutes under transient unsaturated flow conditions â A case study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0477-0487</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The imbalance between incoming and outgoing salt causes salinization of soils and sub-soils that result in increasing the salinity of stream-ï¬ows and agriculture land.This salinization is a serious environmental hazard particularly in semi-arid and arid lands.In order to estimate the magnitude of the hazard posed by salinity,it is important to understand and identify the processes that control salt movement from the soil surface through the root zone to the ground water and stream ï¬ows.In the present study,Malaprabha sub-basin (up to dam site)has been selected which has two distinct climatic zones,sub-humid (upstream of Khanapur)and semi-arid region (downstream of Khanapur).In the upstream,both surface and ground waters are used for irrigation,whereas in the downstream mostly groundwater is used.Both soils and ground waters are more saline in down- stream parts of the study area.In this study we characterized the soil salinity and groundwater quality in both areas.An attempt is also made to model the distribution of potassium concentration in the soil proï¬le in response to varying irrigation conditions using the SWIM (Soil âWater In ï¬ltration and Movement)model.Fair agreement was obtained between predicted and measured results indicating the applicability of the model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Borehole data reveals that during Late Quaternary,the Ganga river was non-existent in its present location near Varanasi.Instead,it was ï¬owing further south towards peripheral craton.Himalayan derived grey micaceous sands were being carried by southward ï¬owing rivers beyond the present day water divide of Ganga and mixed with pink arkosic sand brought by northward ï¬owing peninsular rivers.Subsequently,the Ganga shifted to its present position and got incised.Near Varanasi,the Ganga river is ï¬owing along a NW âSE tectonic lineament.The migration of Ganga river is believed to have been in response to basin expansion caused due to Himalayan tectonics during Middle Pleistocene times.</p>
					<p>Multi-storied sand bodies generated as a result of channel migration provide excellent aquifers conï¬ned by a thick zone of muddy sediments near the surface.Good quality potable water is available at various levels below about 70 m depth in sandy aquifers.Craton derived gravelly coarse- to-medium grained sand forms the main aquifer zones of tens of meter thickness with enormous yield.In contrast,the shallow aquifers made up of recycled inter ï¬uve silt and sandy silt occur under unconï¬ned conditions and show water-level ï¬uctuation of a few meters during pre-and post-monsoon periods.</p>

				<title>Pattern of sedimentation during the Late Paleozoic, Gondwanaland glaciation: An example from the Talchir Formation, Satpura Gondwana basin, central India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0499-0519</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Talchir Formation of Permian age is the lowermost lithostratigraphic unit of the Indian Gondwana successions preserving a record of the Late Paleozoic glaciation that affected the whole Gondwanaland.The formation unconformably overlies the Precambrian basement in all the Gondwana basins of India,and marks initiation of sedimentation after a long hiatus since the Pro- terozoic.The Talchir Formation of the Satpura Gondwana basin of central India shows features diagnostic of deposition under glacial regime such as the presence of diamictites,boulder pavements, bedding plane striation,faceted/striated gravels,bullet-shaped clasts,dropstone,cryoturbation, etc.The Talchir strata of the Satpura basin,in addition to tidal signatures,contain marine bivalve and trace fossils.A proglacial marine environment is thus inferred for their deposition.The dominant lithologies are conglomerate,pebbly sandstone,sandstone and shale with little limestone, which can be classiï¬ed into the following major facies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>matrix-supported conglomerate,</li>
						<li>clast-supported conglomerate,</li>
						<li>cross-strati ï¬ed,channel form pebbly sandstone,</li>
						<li>hummocky,swaley or low-angle cross-strati ï¬ed pebbly and non-pebbly sandstone,</li>
						<li>turbidite/tempestite sheet sandstone,</li>
						<li>massive to ï¬ssile,green to black claystone with carbonate layers and nodules.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The conglomerates are interpreted as deposits of a spectrum of sub-aqueous sediment gravity lows including debris flow, hyperconcentrated/concentrated density flow and grain flow. The crossstratified pebbly sandstone bodies, on the other hand, represent braidplain delta deposits of glacial outwash origin. Hummocky, swaley, low-angle cross-stratified sediment bodies were deposited by storm-generated combined flows in a shoreface setting. In contrast, the sheet sandstone bodies are products of turbidity currents and storm-induced density currents in an inner shelf setting below fair weather wave base. The claystone facies is interpreted as a product of suspension fallout from hypopycnal sediment plumes in the outer shelf domain below storm wave base. All the lithofacies described above occur repetitively in the succession. Three facies-associations have been recognized in the Talchir Formation, representing ice-contact fandelta, outwash braidplain delta and a virtually ice-free, non-deltaic open marine realm. The different marine facies of the Talchir Formation define a number of shallowing-upward packages, which are arranged in the succession with a retrogradational trend to result in an overall fining- and deepening-upward succession. The overlying coal-bearing Barakar Formation has been interpreted to have formed in a tide-wave influenced deltaic setting with a marine, prodeltaic part. The strata that are transitional between Talchir and Barakar Formations show preservation of abundant plant materials suggesting gradual warming. The three facies-associations of the Talchir Formation also point towards progressive decrease in the intensity of glacial activity, inducing changes in the paleogeography from ice-contact depositional environment to an eventually relatively ice-free, open marine condition.</p>

				<title>Indicator minerals as guides to base metal sulphide mineralisation in Betul Belt, central India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0521-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zn-bearing minerals that act as indicator minerals for base metal sulphide mineralization from the  Proterozoic Betul Belt,central India with special emphasis on their genetic signiï¬cance have been discussed.Sulphide mineralisation is hosted by the felsic volcanic rocks and has similarities with volcanic-hosted massive sulphide deposits in other parts of the world.Synvolcanic hydrothermal alteration is crudely zoned with an inner high Mg-Ca core and an outer wider envelop of Al-Fe rich mineral assemblage.Most of the prospects have strata bound,moderately to steeply dipping, multiple,sub-parallel sheet like ore bodies composed of disseminated and semi-massive to massive ores.Zn-bearing spinel,staurolite,biotite and ilmenite typically occur within the foot-wall altera- tion zones in close proximity to the sulphide mineralization.Zincian spinel is ubiquitous irrespective of the nature of alteration zone.Zincian staurolite is nearly absent in Mg-Ca alteration zones but commonly present in Al-Fe alteration zone along with zincian ilmenite.Zn-bearing biotite in intimate association with zincian spinel is generally found in Mg-Ca alteration zone and in the transition to Al-Fe alteration zone.Most of these indicator minerals can be considered as products of desulphidation of sphalerite during metamorphism.Mechanisms other than desulphidation like  formation of gahnite by overstepping of the zinc saturation limit of biotite during retrogression to chlorite and formation of zincian staurolite at the expense of gahnite is also recorded.Field presence of these minerals has immense signiï¬cance in exploration in Betul Belt as they occur in close spatial relationship with the sulphide rich zones and therefore act as direct vectors to ore.</p>

				<title>The High Deccan duricrusts of India and their significance for the âlateriteâ issue</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0537-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the Deccan region of western India ferricrete duricrusts,usually described as laterites,cap some basalt summits east of the Western Ghats escarpment,basalts of the low-lying Konkan Plain to its west,as well as some sizeable isolated basalt plateaus rising from the Plain. The duricrusts are iron-cemented saprolite with vermiform hollows,but apart from that have little in common with the common descriptions of laterite.The classical laterite proï¬le is not present.In particular there are no pisolitic concretions,no or minimal development of con-cretionary crust,and the pallid zone,commonly assumed to be typical of laterites,is absent. A relatively thin,non-indurated saprolite usually lies between the duricrust and fresh basalt.The duricrust resembles the classical laterite of Angadippuram in Kerala (southwestern India),but is much harder.The High Deccan duricrusts capping the basalt summits in the Western Ghats have been interpreted as residuals from a continuous (but now largely destroyed)laterite blanket that represents \textit {in situ} transformation of the uppermost lavas,and thereby as marking the original top of the lava pile.But the unusual pattern of the duricrusts on the map and other evidence suggest instead that the duricrusts formed along a palaeoriver system,and are now in inverted relief.The two interpretations lead to different tectonic histories.Duricrust formation involved lateral material input besides vertical elemental exchange.We may have reached the stage when the very concepts of laterite and lateritization are hindering progress in regolith research.</p>

				<title>Comparing groundwater recharge and base flow in the Bukmoongol small-forested watershed, Korea</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0553-0566</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Groundwater recharge and base ï¬ow using different investigated methods are simulated in the 15-ha Bukmoongol small-forested watershed located at the southern part of Korea.The WHAT system, PART,RORA,PULSE,BFI,and RAP software are used to estimate groundwater recharge or base ï¬ow and base ï¬ow index from the measured stream ï¬ow.Results show that about 15 â31 per cent of annual rainfall might be contributed for base ï¬ow.The watershed groundwater recharge proportions are computed to about 10 â21 per cent during the wet period and 23 â32 per cent for the remainder periods.Mean annual base ï¬ow indices vary from 0.25 to 0.76 estimated using different methods. However,the study found out that all methods were signiï¬cantly correlated with each other.The similarity of various methods is expressed as a weighted relationship provided by the matrix product from the principal component analysis.Overall,the BFI and WHAT software appeared consistent in estimating recharge or base ï¬ow,and base ï¬ow index under Korea âs conditions.The case study recommends the application of different models to other watersheds as well as in low-lying areas where most observation groundwater wells are located with available stream ï¬ow data.</p>

				<title>Surface energy balance of seasonal snow cover for snow-melt estimation in NâW Himalaya</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0567-0573</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study describes time series analysis of snow-melt,radiation data and energy balance for a seasonal snow cover at Dhundi ï¬eld station of SASE,which lies in Pir Panjal range of the  N âW Himalaya,for a winter season from 13 January to 12 April 2005.The analysis shows that mean snow surface temperature remains very close to the melting temperature of snow.It was found close to $â1^\circ C$ for the complete observational period which makes the snow pack at Dhundi moist from its beginning.The average air temperature over this period was found to be $3.5^\circ C$ with hourly average variation from $â5.5^\circ C to 13^\circ C$. The snow surface at this station received a mean short wave radiation of 430 W $m^{â2}$ ,out of which 298 W $m^{â2}$ was re ï¬ected back by the snow surface with mean albedo value of 0.70.The high average temperature and more absorption of solar radiation resulted in higher thermal state of the snowpack which was further responsible for faster and higher densiï¬cation of the snowpack.Net radiation energy was the major component of surface energy budget with a mean value of 83 W $m^{â2}$ .Bulk transfer model was used to calculate turbulent ï¬uxes.The net energy was utilized for satisfying cold content and snow-melt by using measured snow surface temperature and density of snow pack.The mean square error between calculated and measured daily snow-melt was found to be approximately 6.6 mm of water equivalent.</p>

				<title>Mountain range specific analog weather forecast model for northwest Himalaya in India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0575-0587</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mountain range speciï¬c analog weather forecast model is developed utilizing surface weather observations of reference stations in each mountain range in northwest Himalaya (NW-Himalaya).The model searches past similar cases from historical dataset of reference observatory in each mountain range based on current situation.The searched past similar cases of each mountain range are used to draw weather forecast for that mountain range in operational weather forecasting mode, three days in advance.The developed analog weather forecast model is tested with the independent dataset of more than 717 days (542 days for Pir Panjal range in HP)of the past 4 winters (2003 â2004 to 2006 â2007).Independent test results are reasonably good and suggest that there is some possibility of forecasting weather in operational weather forecasting mode employing analog method over different mountain ranges in NW-Himalaya.Signiï¬cant difference in overall accuracy of the model is found for prediction of snow day and no-snow day over different mountain ranges, when weather is predicted under snow day and no-snow day weather forecast categories respectively.In the same mountain range,signi ï¬cant difference is also found in overall accuracy of the model for prediction of snow day and no-snow day for different areas.This can be attributed to their geographical position and topographical differences.The analog weather forecast model performs better than persistence and climatological forecast for day-1 predictions for all the mountain ranges except Karakoram range in NW-Himalaya.The developed analog weather forecast model may help as a guidance tool for forecasting weather in operational weather forecasting mode in different mountain ranges in NW-Himalaya.</p>

				<title>The WRF model performance for the simulation of heavy precipitating events over Ahmedabad during August 2006</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0589-0602</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The summer monsoon season of the year 2006 was highlighted by an unprecedented number of monsoon lows over the central and the western parts of India,particularly giving widespread rainfall over Gujarat and Rajasthan.Ahmedabad had received 540.2 mm of rainfall in the month of August 2006 against the climatological mean of 219.8 mm.The two spells of very heavy rainfall of 108.4 mm and 97.7 mm were recorded on 8 and 12 August 2006 respectively.Due to meteorological complexities involved in replicating the rainfall occurrences over a region,the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF âARW version)modeling system with two different cumulus schemes in a nested con ï¬guration is chosen for simulating these events.The spatial distributions of large-scale circulation and moisture ï¬elds have been simulated reasonably well in this model,though there are some spatial biases in the simulated rainfall pattern.The rainfall amount over Ahmedabad has been underestimated by both the cumulus parameterization schemes.The quantitative validation of the simulated rainfall is done by calculating the categorical skill scores like frequency bias,threat scores (TS)and equitable threat scores (ETS).In this case the KF scheme has outperformed the GD scheme for the low precipitation threshold.</p>

				<title>Skills of different mesoscale models over Indian region during monsoon season: Forecast errors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0603-0620</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Performance of four mesoscale models namely,the MM5,ETA,RSM and WRF,run at NCMRWF for short range weather forecasting has been examined during monsoon-2006.Evaluation is carried out based upon comparisons between observations and day-1 and day-3 forecasts of wind,temperature,speciï¬c humidity,geopotential height,rainfall,systematic errors,root mean square errors and speciï¬c events like the monsoon depressions.</p>
					<p>It is very difficult to address the question of which model performs best over the Indian region? An honest answer is ânone â.Perhaps an ensemble approach would be the best.However, if we must  make a ï¬nal verdict,it can be stated that in general,(i)the WRF is able to produce best All India rainfall prediction compared to observations in the day-1 forecast and,the MM5 is able to produce best All India rainfall forecasts in day-3,but ETA and RSM are able to depict the best distribution of rainfall maxima along the west coast of India,(ii)the MM5 is able to produce least RMSE of wind and geopotential ï¬elds at most of the time,and (iii)the RSM is able to produce least errors in the day-1 forecasts of the tracks,while the ETA model produces least errors in the day-3 forecasts.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study real time data have been used to compare the standard and triangle method by performing the objective analysis of mean sea level pressure.In the standard method,derivative ï¬elds are obtained from the grid point data using ï¬nite difference scheme whereas in the triangle method,a set of non-overlapping triangles are formed from the observations and the scalar and the spatial derivatives are computed directly at the centroid of each of the non-overlapping triangles.These scalars and their derivatives are then mapped to uniform grids by using the standard method.It has been found that objectively analysed scalar ï¬eld obtained using standard method is superior to the scalar ï¬eld derived by the triangle method,whereas the derivative ï¬elds produced by triangle method are superior to the derivative ï¬elds produced using standard method. A variational objective analysis scheme has been developed and an experiment has been carried out with depression case of June (11 â15)2004.It is found that the new scheme (variational)is able to extract the better parts of both triangle and standard methods.The results of this study will be useful in carrying out diagnostic calculations that involve derivative estimates.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Tree-ring-width index chronologies of teak (\textit {Tectona grandis} L.F.)from three sites in central India have been studied for their dendroclimatic potential.The existence of good correlation among the three site chronologies indicates the inï¬uence of common forcing factor  to the tree growth of the region.Tree growth and climate relationship based on correlation analysis revealed the important contribution of moisture index and rainfall rather than the direct in ï¬uence of the temperature on tree growth during different seasons.Signiï¬cant positive relationship of moisture index and rainfall during the monsoon months as well as on the annual scale with tree-ring width variations over the region indicates the important role of moisture availability at the root zone.The results suggest that the teak tree-ring chronologies can be used as high resolution proxy for past precipitation and moisture level in the environment.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we present a seismic hazard scenario for the Garhwal region of the north-western Himalayan range, in terms of the horizontal Peak Ground Acceleration. The scenario earthquake of moment magnitude $\textit {M_w}$ 8.5 has a 10% exceedance probability over the next 50 years. These estimates, the first for the region, were calculated through a stepwise process based on:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>An estimation of the Maximum Credible Earthquake from the seismicity of the region and Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program considerations, and</li>
						<li>four seismotectonic parameters abstracted from near field weak-motion data recorded at five stations installed in Chamoli District of the Garhwal region in the aftermath of the 1999 Chamoli earthquake. The latter include:</li>
						<li>The frequency dependent power law for the shear wave quality factor, $\textit {Q_S}$,</li>
						<li>the site amplification at each station using horizontal-to-vertical-spectral ratio and generalized inversion technique,</li>
						<li>source parameters of various events recorded by the array and application of the resulting relations between the scalar seismic moment $\textit {M_0}$ (dyne-cm) and moment magnitude Mw and the corner frequency, $\textit {f_c}$ (Hz) and moment magnitude $\textit {M_w}$ to simulate spectral acceleration due to higher magnitude events corresponding to the estimated Maximum Credible Earthquake, and </li>
						<li>regional and site specific local spectral attenuation relations at different geometrically central frequencies in the low, moderate and high frequency bands.</li>

				<title>Uncertainties in the estimation of $\textit {M_max}$</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0671-0682</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present paper, the parameters affecting the uncertainties on the estimation of $\textit {M_max}$ have been investigated by exploring different methodologies being used in the analysis of seismicity catalogue and estimation of seismicity parameters. A critical issue to be addressed before any scientific analysis is to assess the quality, consistency, and homogeneity of the data. The empirical relationships between different magnitude scales have been used for conversions for homogenization of seismicity catalogues to be used for further seismic hazard assessment studies. An endeavour has been made to quantify the uncertainties due to magnitude conversions and the seismic hazard parameters are then estimated using different methods to consider the epistemic uncertainty in the process. The study area chosen is around Delhi. The \textit {b} value and the magnitude of completeness for the four seismogenic sources considered around Delhi varied more than 40% using the three catalogues compiled based on different magnitude conversion relationships. The effect of the uncertainties has been then shown on the estimation of $\textit {M_max}$ and the probabilities of occurrence of different magnitudes. It has been emphasized to consider the uncertainties and their quantification to carry out seismic hazard assessment and in turn the seismic microzonation.</p>

				<title>Modeling and synthesis of strong ground motion</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0683-0705</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Success of earthquake resistant design practices critically depends on how accurately the future ground motion can be determined at a desired site. But very limited recorded data are available about ground motion in India for engineers to rely upon. To identify the needs of engineers, under such circumstances, in estimating ground motion time histories, this article presents a detailed review of literature on modeling and synthesis of strong ground motion data. In particular, modeling of seismic sources and earth medium, analytical and empirical Greenâs functions approaches for ground motion simulation, stochastic models for strong motion and ground motion relations are covered. These models can be used to generate realistic near-field and far-field ground motion in regions lacking strong motion data. Numerical examples are shown for illustration by taking Kutch earthquake-2001 as a case study.</p>

				<title>Spatial-Temporal variability of seismic hazard in Peninsular India</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0707-0718</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper examines the variability of seismic activity observed in the case of different geological zones of peninsular India ($10^\circ Nâ26^\circ N; 68^\circ Eâ90^\circ E$) based on earthquake catalog between the period 1842 and 2002 and estimates earthquake hazard for the region. With compilation of earthquake catalog in terms of moment magnitude and establishing broad completeness criteria, we derive the seismicity  parameters for each geologic zone of peninsular India using maximum likelihood procedure. The estimated parameters provide the basis for understanding the historical seismicity associated with different geological zones of peninsular India and also provide important inputs for future seismic hazard estimation studies in the region. Based on present investigation, it is clear that earthquake recurrence activity in various geologic zones of peninsular India is distinct and varies considerably between its cratonic and rifting zones. The study identifies the likely hazards due to the possibility of moderate to large earthquakes in peninsular India and also presents the influence of spatial rate variation in the seismic activity of this region. This paper presents the influence of source zone characterization and recurrence rate variation pattern on the maximum earthquake magnitude estimation. The results presented in the paper provide a useful basis for probabilistic seismic hazard studies and microzonation studies in peninsular India.</p>

				<title>Dynamic soil properties for microzonation of Delhi, India</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0719-0730</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Delhi, the capital of India, has experienced mild seismic shaking during several earthquakes in the past. The large variations of depth to bedrock and ground water table coupled with different soil types at different locations of Delhi necessitate a seismic microzonation study. Dynamic soil properties such as shear wave velocity, modulus reduction and damping characteristics of local soils are the basic and essential input parameters for conducting even a preliminary ground response analysis which is an essential input in microzonation studies. Shear wave velocity is not measured routinely due to its high cost and lack of the required expertise. Several researchers in the past developed correlations between shear wave velocity (\textit {V_s}) and routinely measured \textit {N} values. In the present study, shear wave velocity profiles measured in the field at more than 80 borehole locations to a depth of about 20 to 32m using Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) are presented and correlations between shear wave velocity and \textit {N} values are also presented for use by engineers and designers. Results of strain and stress controlled cyclic triaxial tests on remoulded samples of sandsilt mixtures in the high strain range are used for generating the modulus reduction and damping curves and are compared with the well-known curves in the literature. The results presented in this article can be used for microzonation studies as well as site specific ground response analyses at Delhi.</p>

				<title>Importance of quantification of local site effects based on wave propagation in seismic microzonation</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0731-0748</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the three most important aspects of seismic microzonation namely prediction of fundamental frequency (\textit {F_0}) of soil deposit, aggravation factor (aggravation factor is simply the extra spectral amplification due to complex 2D site effects over the 1D response of the soil column) and the spatial variability of the ground motion caused by the basin-edge induced Love waves. The predicted \textit {F_0} of single, double and three-soil-layered models revealed that the available empirical relations to predict the \textit {F_0} of layered soil deposits are inadequate. We recommend the use of analytical or numerical methods to predict such an important parameter based on wave propagation effects. An increase of amplitude of Love wave, strain level and average aggravation factor (AAF) with increase of impedance contrast was obtained. Based on the trend of rate of decrease of AAF and maximum strain with offset from the basin-edge, we can qualitatively infer that the effects of induced Love wave may reduce to a negligible value after a traveled distance of 6.5â10.0 $\lambda _\textit {F}$ (where $\lambda _\textit {F}$ is the wavelength corresponding to the \textit {F_o} of soil layer). The obtained increase of strain level with the decrease of distance between two receiver points used for the computation of strain reflects that structures having spatial extent smaller than the $\lambda _\textit {F}$ may suffer damage due to the basin-edge induced surface waves. The fast rate of decrease of strain with the offset from the strong lateral discontinuity (SLD)/basin-edge may be attributed to the dispersive nature of Love wave. We can incorporate the increased spectral amplification due to the induced surface waves in the form of aggravation factor but till date we have no effective way to incorporate the effects of developed strain by induced surface waves in seismic microzonation or in building codes.</p>

				<title>A technical note on seismic microzonation in the central United States</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0749-0756</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microzonation is an effort to evaluate and map potential hazards found in an area, urban area in particular, that could be induced by strong ground shaking during an earthquake. These hazards include: ground motion amplification, liquefaction, and slope failure. The microzonation maps, depicting ground-motion amplification, liquefaction, and landslide potentials, can be produced if the ground motion on bedrock (input) and the site conditions are known. These maps, in combination with ground-motion hazard maps (on bedrock), can be used to develop a variety of hazard mitigation strategies such as seismic risk assessment, emergency response and preparedness, and land-use planning. However, these maps have certain limitations that result from the nature of regional mapping, data limitations, generalization, and computer modeling. These microzonations show that when strong ground shaking occurs, damage is more likely to occur, or be more severe, in the higher hazard areas. The zones shown on the hazard maps should not serve as a substitute for site-specific evaluations.</p>

				<title>Site response zones and short-period earthquake ground motion projections for the Las Vegas Basin</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0757-0772</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A deterministic seismic hazard analysis was conducted to address the effect of local soil conditions on earthquake-induced strong ground motion in the Las Vegas Basin, Nevada (US). Using a large geological and geotechnical database, two response units were defined: a fine-grained unit, predominantly clay; and a coarse-grained unit, predominantly gravel. A moderate number of high-quality shallow shear wave velocity measurements were collected from which characteristic shear wave velocity profiles were developed for each response unit. An equivalent-linear one-dimensional site response model was used. The model was calibrated using a basin-wide, small-strain ground motion database. Calibration tests showed that ground motion projections become increasingly conservative with increasing ground-motion amplitude. Projections were overconservative for the coarsegrained response unit, likely due to the sparseness of the velocity database. For the earthquake response analyses, historical ground motions were used to model characteristic âbedrockâ motion for earthquakes on 10 faults judged to be critical. Response spectral envelopes were generated for each unit through Monte-Carlo simulations. For the fine-grained response unit, 95th percentile peak ground acceleration, peak spectral acceleration and predominant period were 310 $cm/s^{2}, 1100cm/s^{2}$, and 0.29 s, respectively. With respect to codified design spectra, projections are lower at short periods and higher at long periods. Projections of peak spectral accelerations for the coarsegrained response unit, were more than double that of codified spectra; however, they are believed to be overconservative. Near-fault effects and basin-edge effects, though potentially important, were not considered in these analyses.</p>

				<title>Site response of the Ganges Basin inferred from re-evaluated macroseismic observations from the 1897 Shillong, 1905 Kangra and 1934 Nepal earthquakes</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0773-0782</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyze previously published geodetic data and intensity values for the \textit {M_s} = 8.1 Shillong (1897), \textit {M_s} = 7.8 Kangra (1905), and \textit {M_s} = 8.2 Nepal/Bihar (1934) earthquakes to investigate the rupture zones of these earthquakes as well as the amplification of ground motions throughout the Punjab, Ganges and Brahmaputra valleys. For each earthquake we subtract the observed MSK intensities from a synthetic intensity derived from an inferred planar rupture model of the earthquake, combined with an attenuation function derived from instrumentally recorded earthquakes. The resulting residuals are contoured to identify regions of anomalous intensity caused primarily by local site effects. Observations indicative of liquefaction are treated separately from other indications of shaking severity lest they inflate inferred residual shaking estimates. Despite this precaution we find that intensites are 1â3 units higher near the major rivers, as well as at the edges of the Ganges basin. We find evidence for a post-critical Moho reflection from the 1897 and 1905 earthquakes that raises intensities 1â2 units at distances of the order of 150 km from the rupture zone, and we find that the 1905 earthquake triggered a substantial subsequent earthquake at Dehra Dun, at a distance of approximately 150 km. Four or more \textit {M} = 8 earthquakes are apparently overdue in the region based on seismic moment summation in the past 500 years. Results from the current study permit anticipated intensities in these future earthquakes to be refined to incorporate site effects derived from dense macroseismic data.</p>

				<title>Considerations on seismic microzonation in areas with two-dimensional hills</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0783-0796</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the results of an extensive numerical parametric study on seismic behavior of 2D homogenous hills subjected to vertically propagating incident SV waves. It is shown that the amplification potential of these hills is strongly influenced by the wavelength, by the shape ratio, by the shape of the hill and in a less order of importance, by the Poisson ratio of the media. The 2D topography effect could be ignored, only if the hill has a shape ratio of less than 0.1 or if it is subjected to incident waves with predominant dimensionless periods of greater than 13 times the shape ratio. In incidence of waves with wavelengths longer than the width of the hill, the amplification curve usually finds its maximum at the crest and decreases towards the base of the hill. Else, some de-amplification zones would occur along the hill. Among hills with similar shape ratios, those with intermediate cross section areas show intermediate seismic behavior, too.  Estimated seismic site coefficients for the crest of a 2D rocky hill depend on its shape ratio and could reach even 1.7, which encourages one to classify it according to standard site categorization procedures as soil profile types SC or SD instead of the conventional SB type.</p>

				<title>Preliminary results for a semi-automated quantification of site effects using geomorphometry and ASTER satellite data for Mozambique, Pakistan and Turkey</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0797-0808</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estimation of the degree of local seismic wave amplification (site effects) requires precise information about the local site conditions. In many regions of the world, local geologic information is either sparse or is not readily available. Because of this, seismic hazard maps for countries such as Mozambique, Pakistan and Turkey are developed without consideration of site factors and, therefore, do not provide a complete assessment of future hazards. Where local geologic information is available, details on the traditional maps often lack the precision (better than 1:10,000 scale) or the level of information required for modern seismic microzonation requirements. We use high-resolution (1:50,000) satellite imagery and newly developed image analysis methods to begin addressing this problem. Our imagery, consisting of optical data and digital elevation models (DEMs), is recorded from the ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) sensor system. We apply a semi-automated, object-oriented, multi-resolution feature segmentation method to identify and extract local terrain features. Then we classify the terrain types into mountain, piedmont and basin units using geomorphometry (topographic slope) as our parameter. Next, on the basis of the site classification schemes from the Wills and Silva (1998) study and the Wills \textit {et al} (2000) and Wills and Clahan (2006) maps of California, we assign the local terrain units with \textit {V_s}30 (the average seismic shear-wave velocity through the upper 30m of the subsurface) ranges for selected regions in Mozambique, Pakistan and Turkey. We find that the applicability of our site class assignments in each region is a good first-approximation for quantifying local site conditions and that additional work, such as the verification of the terrainâs compositional rigidity, is needed.</p>

				<title>Earthquake hazard in northeast India â A seismic microzonation approach with typical case studies from Sikkim Himalaya and Guwahati city</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0809-0831</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive analytical as well as numerical treatment of seismological, geological, geomorphological and geotechnical concepts has been implemented through microzonation projects in the northeast Indian provinces of Sikkim Himalaya and Guwahati city, representing cases of contrasting geological backgrounds â a hilly terrain and a predominantly alluvial basin respectively. The estimated maximum earthquakes in the underlying seismic source zones, demarcated in the broad northeast Indian region, implicates scenario earthquakes of \textit {M_W} 8.3 and 8.7 to the respective study regions for deterministic seismic hazard assessments. The microzonation approach as undertaken in the present analyses involves multi-criteria seismic hazard evaluation through thematic integration of contributing factors. The geomorphological themes for Sikkim Himalaya include surface geology, soil cover, slope, rock outcrop and landslide integrated to achieve geological hazard distribution. Seismological themes, namely surface consistent peak ground acceleration and predominant frequency were, thereafter, overlaid on and added with the geological hazard distribution to obtain the seismic hazard microzonation map of the Sikkim Himalaya. On the other hand, the microzonation study of Guwahati city accounts for eight themes â geological and geomorphological, basement or bedrock, landuse, landslide, factor of safety for soil stability, shear wave velocity, predominant frequency, and surface consistent peak ground acceleration. The five broad qualitative hazard classifications â âlowâ, âmoderateâ, âhighâ, âmoderate highâ and âvery highâ could be applied in both the cases, \textit {albeit} with different implications to peak ground acceleration variations. These developed hazard maps offer better representation of the local specific seismic hazard variation in the terrain.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, an attempt has been made to evaluate the seismic hazard considering local site effects by carrying out detailed geotechnical and geophysical site characterization in Bangalore, India to develop microzonation maps. An area of 220 $km^2$, encompassing Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP) has been chosen as the study area. Seismic hazard analysis and microzonation of Bangalore are addressed in three parts: in the first part, estimation of seismic hazard is done using seismotectonic and geological information. Second part deals with site characterization using geotechnical and shallow geophysical techniques. In the last part, local site effects are assessed by carrying out one-dimensional (1-D) ground response analysis (using the program SHAKE 2000) using both standard penetration test (SPT) data and shear wave velocity data from multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW) survey. Further, field experiments using microtremor studies have also been carried out for evaluation of predominant frequency of the soil columns. The same has been assessed using 1-D ground response analysis and compared with microtremor results. Further, the Seed and Idriss simplified approach has been adopted to evaluate the soil liquefaction susceptibility and liquefaction resistance assessment. Microzonation maps have been prepared with a scale of 1:20,000. The detailed methodology, along with experimental details, collated data, results and maps are presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Seismic hazard assessment of Chennai city considering local site effects</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0853-0863</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chennai city suffered moderate tremors during the 2001 Bhuj and Pondicherry earthquakes and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake. After the Bhuj earthquake, Indian Standard IS: 1893 was revised and Chennai city was upgraded from zone II to zone III which leads to a substantial increase of the design ground motion parameters. Therefore, a comprehensive study is carried out to assess the seismic hazard of Chennai city based on a deterministic approach. The seismicity and seismotectonic details within a 100 km radius of the study area have been considered. The one-dimensional ground response analysis was carried out for 38 representative sites by the equivalent linear method using the SHAKE91 program to estimate the ground motion parameters considering the local site effects. The shear wave velocity profile was inferred from the corrected blow counts and it was verified with the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Wave (MASW) test performed for a representative site. The seismic hazard is represented in terms of characteristic site period and Spectral Acceleration Ratio (SAR) contours for the entire city. It is found that structures with low natural period undergo significant amplification mostly in the central and southern parts of Chennai city due to the presence of deep soil sites with clayey or sandy deposits and the remaining parts undergo marginal amplification.</p>

				<title>Proposed seismic hazard maps of Sumatra and Java Islands and microzonation study of Jakarta City, Indonesia</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0865-0878</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the development of spectral hazard maps for Sumatra and Java islands, Indonesia and microzonation study for Jakarta city. The purpose of this study is to propose a revision of the seismic hazard map in Indonesian Seismic Code SNI 03-1726-2002. Some improvements in seismic hazard analysis were implemented in the analysis by considering the recent seismic activities around Java and Sumatra. The seismic hazard analysis was carried out using 3-dimension (3-D) seismic source models (fault source model) using the latest research works regarding the tectonic setting of Sumatra and Java. Two hazard levels were analysed for representing 10% and 2% probability of exceedance (PE) in 50 years ground motions for Sumatra and Java. Peak ground acceleration contour maps for those two hazard levels and two additional macrozonation maps for 10% PE in 50 years were produced during this research. These two additional maps represent short period (0.2 s) and long-period (1.0 s) spectra values at the bedrock. Microzonation study is performed in order to obtain ground motion parameters such as acceleration, amplification factor and response spectra at the surface of Jakarta. The analyses were carried out using nonlinear approach. The results were used to develop contour of acceleration at the surface of Jakarta. Finally, the design response spectra for structural design purposes are proposed in this study.</p>

				<title>Relative seismic shaking vulnerability microzonation using an adaptation of the Nakamura Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio Method</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on : Seismic Microzonation</feature>
				<page>0879-0895</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An alternative seismic shaking vulnerability survey method to computational intensive theoretical modelling of site response to earthquake, and time consuming test \textit {versus} reference site horizontal ratio methods, is described. The methodology is suitable for small to large scale engineering investigations. Relative seismic shaking vulnerability microzonation using an adaptation of the Nakamura horizontal to vertical spectral ratio method provides many advantages over alternative methods including: low cost; rapid field phase (100 $km^2$ can easily be covered by a single operator in 5 days); low and flexible instrumentation requirements (a single seismometer and data logger of almost any type is required); field data can be collected at any time during the day or night (the results are insensitive to ambient social noise); no basement rock reference site is required (thus eliminating trigger synchronisation between reference and multiple test site seismographs); rapid software aided analysis; insensitivity to ground-shaking resonance peaks; ability to compare results obtained from non-contiguous survey fields. The methodology is described in detail, and a practical case study is provided, including mapped results. The resulting microzonation maps indicate the relative seismic shaking vulnerability for built structures of different height categories within adjacent zones, with a resolution of approximately 1 km.</p>

				<title>Urban effects of Chennai on sea breeze induced convection and precipitation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0897-0909</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Doppler radar derived wind speed and direction proï¬les showed a well developed sea breeze circulation over the Chennai, India region on 28 June, 2003. Rainfall totals in excess of 100 mm resulted from convection along the sea breeze front. Inland propagation of the sea  breeze front was observed in radar reï¬ectivity imagery. High-resolution MM5 simulations were used to investigate the inï¬uence of Chennai urban land use on sea breeze initiated convection and precipitation. A comparison of observed and simulated 10 m wind speed and direction over Chennai showed that the model was able to simulate the timing and strength of the sea breeze. Urban effects are shown to increase the near surface air temperature over Chennai by 3.0 K during the early morning hours. The larger surface temperature gradient along the coast due to urban effects increased onshore ï¬ow by $4.0m s^{â1}$ .Model sensitivity study revealed that precipitation totals were enhanced by 25 mm over a large region 150 km west of Chennai due to urban effects. Deï¬ciency in model physics related to night-time forecasts are addressed.</p>

				<title>On the measurement of the surface energy budget over a land surface during the summer monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0911-0923</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The measurement of surface energy balance over a land surface in an open area in Bangalore is reported. Measurements of all variables needed to calculate the surface energy balance on time scales longer than a week are made. Components of radiative ï¬uxes are measured while sensible and latent heat ï¬uxes are based on the bulk method using measurements made at two levels on a micrometeorological tower of 10 m height. The bulk ï¬ux formulation is veriï¬ed by comparing its ï¬uxes with direct ï¬uxes using sonic anemometer data sampled at 10 Hz.Soil temperature is measured at 4 depths. Data have been continuously collected for over 6 months covering pre-monsoon and monsoon periods during the year 2006. The study ï¬rst addresses the issue of getting the ï¬uxes accurately.It is shown that water vapour measurements are the most crucial. A bias of 0.25% in relative humidity,which is well above the normal accuracy assumed by the manufacturers but achievable in the ï¬eld using a combination of laboratory calibration and ï¬eld intercomparisons, results in about 20 W $m^{â2}$ change in the latent heat ï¬ux on the seasonal time scale. When seen on the seasonal time scale,the net longwave radiation is the largest energy loss term at the experimental site. The seasonal variation in the energy sink term is small compared to that in the energy source term.</p>

				<title>Estimation of urban mixed layer height in Zanjan using LIDAR observations and numerical modeling</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0925-0934</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Air pollution predictions often require the height of atmospheric mixed layer in time especially in big cities. Here, the variation of the height of this layer is estimated from direct measurements and also from a numerical forecast model with a high resolution boundary layer scheme. The height of the daytime mixed layer for the city of Zanjan ($48.5^\circ N,36.7^\circ E$, 1700 m above sea level)is measured using a LIDAR (532 nm)system, which works based on aerosols scattering of laser light. The mixed layer height (\textit {z_i}) for Zanjan city, well above mean sea level compared to other major cities in the world,is found to be between 1.4 km typically in spring and 2.2 km in summer, for synoptic calm conditions. Also, the MM5 forecast model with a proper boundary layer scheme (MRF)is used to estimate \textit {z_i} which shows rather good agreement with direct observations using the LIDAR system. The entrainment zone of the mixed layer was also found to undergo some occasional temporal growth that may be attributed to shear instability that led to more mixed layer growth.</p>

				<title>Anaerobic oxidation of methane in coastal sediment from Guishan Island (Pearl River Estuary), South China Sea</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0935-0943</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concentrations of $CH_{4}, SO^{2â}_{4}, \Sigma CO_{2}$ and the carbon isotope compositions of $\Sigma CO_{2}$ and $CH_{4}$ in the pore-water of the GS sedimentary core collected from Guishan Island (Pearl River Estuary), South China Sea,were determined. The methane concentration in the pore-water shows dramatic changes and sulfate concentration gradients are linear at the base of the sulfate reduction zone for the station. The carbon isotope of methane becomes heavier at the sulfate-methane transition (SMT)likely because of the Raleigh distillation effect; $^{12}CH_4$ was oxidized faster than $^{13}CH _4$ and this caused the enrichment of residual methane $\delta ^{13}C$ and $\delta ^{13}C --\delta CO_2$ minimum. The geochemical proï¬les of the pore-water support the existence of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), which is mainly controlled by the quality and quantity of the sedimentary organic matter. As inferred from the index of $\delta ^{13}C--TOC$ value and TOC/TN ratio, the organic matter is a mix of mainly refractory terrestrial component plus some labile alga marine-derived in the study area. A large amount of labile organic matter (mainly labile alga marine-derived) is consumed \textit {via} the process of sedimentary organic matter diagenesis, and this reduces the amount of labile organic matter incorporated into the base of the sulfate reduction zone. Due to the scarcity of labile organic matter, the sulfate will in turn be consumed by its reaction with methane and therefore AOM takes place.Based on a diffussion model, the portion of pore-water sulfate reduction \textit {via} AOM is 58.6%,and the percentage of $\Sigma CO_2$ in the pore-water derived from AOM is 41.4%. Thus, AOM plays an important role in the carbon and sulfur cycling in the marine sediments of Pearl River Estuary.</p>

					<p>An analytical solution is obtained to predict the contaminant concentration along unsteady ground-water ï¬ow in semi-in ï¬nite aquifer. Initially,the aquifer is not supposed to be solute free ,i.e.,aquifer is not clean.A time-dependent source concentration is considered at the origin of the aquifer and at the other end of the aquifer, it is supposed to be zero. The time-dependent forms of unsteady velocities are considered in which one such form ,i.e., sinusoidal form represents the seasonal pattern in a year in tropical regions. The Laplace Transformation Technique (LTT)is used to get an analytical solution and a graphical representation is made through MATLAB.</p>

				<title>Wave propagation in thermoelastic saturated porous medium</title>

				<page>0951-0958</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biot âs theory for wave propagation in saturated porous solid is modiï¬ed to study the propagation  of thermoelastic waves in poroelastic medium. Propagation of plane harmonic waves is considered in isotropic poroelastic medium. Relations are derived among the wave-induced temperature in the medium and the displacements of ï¬uid and solid particles. Christoffel equations obtained are modiï¬ed with the thermal as well as thermoelastic coupling parameters. These equations explain the existence and propagation of four waves in the medium. Three of the waves are attenuating longitudinal waves and one is a non-attenuating transverse wave. Thermal properties of the medium have no effect on the transverse wave. The velocities and attenuation of the longitudinal waves are computed for a numerical model of liquid-saturated sandstone. Their variations with thermal as well as poroelastic parameters are exhibited through numerical examples.</p>

				<title>Uplift along the western margin of the Deccan Basalt Province: Is there any geomorphometric evidence?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0959-0971</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In line with the passive margin landscape evolutionary model in vogue, sustained erosion and long-distance retreat of the Western Ghat escarpment are widely considered to be the results of erosionally-driven isostatic uplift since Tertiary by many workers. Others have postulated or adduced evidence for strong neotectonic activity in the Ghat region. An obvious question in this regard is whether there is any geomorphometric evidence in support of this widespread view? In order to test the hypothesis of ongoing post-rift fexural uplift or neotectonic activity in the western Deccan Basalt Province (DBP), geomorphometric analysis was carried out and commonly used geomorphic indices of active tectonics (GAT)were derived for 30 selected river basins on both sides of the Western Ghat. SRTM-DEM data and ArcGIS were used to derive the indices. Tectonic geomorphic analysis based on ï¬ve proxy indicators suggests that the differences in GAT indices,  both along strike and across the Western Ghat,are statistically insigniï¬cant. The index values are nowhere close to the GAT values typically associated with drainage basins affected by active tectonics and deformation.Mapping of the indices reveals lack of discernable trends. The adduced results indicate that the western DBP belongs to the class of relatively low tectonic activity.</p>

				<title>Model-based remote sensing algorithms for particulate organic carbon (POC) in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrographic data, including particulate organic carbon (POC) from the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico (NEGOM) study, were combined with remotely-sensed SeaWiFS data to estimate POC concentration using principal component analysis (PCA). The spectral radiance was extracted at each NEGOM station, digitized, and averaged. The mean value and spurious trends were removed from each spectrum. De-trended data included six wavelengths at 58 stations. The correlation between the weighting factors of the first six eigenvectors and POC concentration were applied using multiple linear regression. PCA algorithms based on the first three, four, and five modes accounted for 90, 95, and 98% of total variance and yielded significant correlations with POC with \textit {R}^{2} = 0.89, 0.92, and 0.93. These full waveband approaches provided robust estimates of POC in various water types.</p>
					<p>Three different analyses (root mean square error, mean ratio and standard deviation) showed similar error estimates, and suggest that spectral variations in the modes defined by just the first four characteristic vectors are closely correlated with POC concentration, resulting in only negligible loss of spectral information from additional modes. The use of POC algorithms greatly increases the spatial and temporal resolution for interpreting POC cycling and can be extrapolated throughout and perhaps beyond the area of shipboard sampling.</p>

				<title>Assessment of different topographic corrections in AWiFS satellite imagery of Himalaya terrain</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0011-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The inï¬uence of topographic effects in optical satellite imagery is not investigated very extensively in the Himalayan terrain.The topographic variability causes a problem of differential illumination due to steep and varying slopes in rugged Himalayan terrain. Therefore,topographic corrections are essential for qualitative and quantitative analysis of snow cover applications.The present paper discusses the implementation of different topographic correction models on AWiFS sensor onboard IRS P6 satellite images and the qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis in detail.Both the Lambertian and non-Lambertian assumptions have been considered in the present analysis with the aim to explore best suitable empirical model for rugged terrain.The main topographic methods implemented are:</p>

						<li>C-correction</li>
						<li>Minneart corrections</li>
						<li>Civco âs modi ï¬ed version of cosine correction</li>

					<p>Lambertian assumptions are found to be very unrealistic over Himalayan terrain as these lead to either underestimation or overestimation of physical parameters signiï¬cantly both on sunlit slopes as well as the slopes away from the Sun.This problem is overcome by considering non-Lambertian assumption.Minneart constant and C-correction coefficients for all AWiFS satellite bands are estimated using regression analysis.All the results due to topographic effects are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively using four criteria namely visual analysis,validation with ï¬eld measurements (\textit {in-situ} observations),spectral re ï¬ectance of training samples of snow on the south and north aspects and graphically.The visual analysis conï¬rms the minimization of three dimensional relief effects in two-stage normalization and slope matching methods and retrieves some of the information under mountain shadow.Due to the very bright surface of snow ï¬elds there is likely to be more diffuse reï¬ected light in these areas than over darker vegetated surfaces.The qualitative analysis in other methods does not extract any information on shady slopes.The quantitative validation of topographic results in satellite imagery with \textit {in-situ} observations shows underestimation of spectral reï¬ectance of snow signiï¬cantly except for slope matching technique. It is also apparent that although all the topographic methods correct the reï¬ectance of training snow samples on the south and north aspects but most acceptable values are achieved using slope matching.The results obtained from graphical analysis reveal that mean reï¬ectance after all topo- graphic corrections are  independent of illumination.This study also suggests that the suitability of topographic models can not be concluded as successful based on single criterion.Slope matching technique is the only technique which satisï¬es all the four criteria successfully and produces the best result for Himalayan terrain.</p>

				<title>Western disturbances seen with AMSU-B and infrared sensors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Western disturbances (WD) of winter and pre-monsoon seasons are the important sources of rainfall in the Indo-Gangetic plains. WDs are troughs or circulations in the westerly winds modified by the Himalayas. Operationally, WDs are monitored using infrared (IR) and water vapour (WV) images. Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B), flying onboard the NOAA satellites, also allows WDs to be monitored in five microwave frequencies. Two are in water vapour window (89, 150 GHz) and three are absorption channels (centred at 183.31 GHz). Unlike the top of cloud view in IR or WV, AMSU-B radiances show the effect of moisture and hydrometeors in different layers.</p>
					<p>Two cases of WD (17 April 2001 and 18â19 February 2003) are discussed using the microwave data from AMSU-B and the IR and WV data from Meteosat-5. The aim here is to demonstrate the skill of AMSU-B in delineating structure of WDs. In particular, the cold intrusion and the moist conveyor belts are examined. It was found that the multi-channel view of the AMSU-B permits a better understanding of the moist structures seen in the conveyor belts.</p>
					<p>The \textit {\acute{a} trous} wavelet transform is used to clearly bring out mesoscale features in WDs. AMSU-B brings out intense convection as a large depression of BTs (&lt; 50K) at 150/176 GHz, cirrus and moist bands at 180/182 GHz.  Mesoscale convection lines within WDs that last short time are shown here for the first time only in the AMSU-B images. Large-scale cirrus features are separated using the \textit {\acute{a} trous} wavelet transform.</p>
					<p> Lastly, it is shown that there is a good likeness in the rain contours in the 3-h rain 3B42 (computed from TRMM and other data) to AMSU-B depressions in BT. Overall, AMSU-B shows better skill in delineating the structure of clouds and rain in WDs.</p>

				<title>Aerosol optical depths at Mohal-Kullu in the northwestern Indian Himalayan high altitude station during ICARB</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0041-0048</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>First time observations of spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) at Mohal ($31.9^\circ N, 77.11^\circ E$; altitude 1154m amsl) in the Kullu valley, located in the northwestern Indian Himalayan region, have been carried out during Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB), as a part of the Indian Space Research OrganisationâGeosphere Biosphere Program (ISROâGBP). AODs at six wavelengths are obtained using Microtops-II Sunphotometer and Ozonometer. The monthly mean values of AOD at 500 nm are found to be $0.27 \pm 0.04$ and $0.24 \pm 0.02$ during March and April, 2006 respectively. However, their monthly mean values are $0.33 \pm 0.04$ at 380 nm and $0.20 \pm 0.03$ nm at 870 nm during March 2006 and $0.31 \pm 0.3$ at 380 nm and $0.17 \pm 0.2$ at 870 nm during April 2006, showing a gradual decrease in AOD with wavelength. The ËAngstrom wavelength exponent $'\alpha '$ had a mean value of $0.72 \pm 0.05$, implying reduced dominance of fine particles. Further, the afternoon AOD values are higher as compared to forenoon values by $\sim 33.0%$ during March and by $\sim 9.0%$ during April 2006 and are attributed to the pollutant lifted up from the valley by the evolving boundary layer. Besides the long-range transportation of aerosol particles by airmass from the Great Sahara and the Thar Desert regions to the observing site, the high values of AODs have also been influenced by biomass burning and frequent incidents of forest fire at local levels.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0049-0059</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The tropopause height and tropopause temperature are sensitive to temperature changes in troposphere and stratosphere. These are the measures of global climatic variability. Atmospheric profiles of temperature, refractivity and water vapour are always needed for communication, navigation and atmospheric modeling studies. The tropopause characteristics over the Indian region have been studied using radio occultation measurements (CHAMP) on the basis of cold point criterion. Tropopause height shows large variation in the latitude range $\sim 30^\circ â40^\circ N$ during winter. Tropopause temperature less than $â82^\circ C$, assumed to facilitate troposphere to stratosphere air transport, is observed at a number of tropical Indian locations and no seasonal pattern is observed in its occurrence. The bias in temperature and refractivity deduced from radiosonde and radio occultation measurements is also presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Surface layer meteorological data collected at a coastal site, at Vasco-Da-Gama ($15^\circ 21^\prime N, 73^\circ 51^\prime E, 58.5m MSL$) (13â18 July, 2002) with prevailing southwesterly surface winds are analyzed to study the characteristics of internal boundary layer at a short fetch using an instrumented tower (9 m). The spectral and turbulence characteristics of wind are compared with earlier measurements made at a comparatively homogeneous terrain and the standards available in literature. The study show the smaller eddies in the vertical velocity spectrum attains equilibrium with the underlying surface at a short fetch itself and follows spectral similarity. However, this is not followed by longitudinal and transverse velocity spectra under unstable as well as stable conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This study presents shear wave splitting analysis results observed at ISP (Isparta)broadband station in the Isparta Angle,southwestern Turkey.We selected 21 good quality seismic events out of nearly 357 earthquakes and calculated splitting parameters (polarization direction of fast wave, $\phi $ and delay time between fast and slow waves,$\delta t$ )from mainly SKS and a few SKKS phases of the selected 21 seismic events.Then,we compared calculated splitting parameters at ISP station ($56^\circ \leq \phi \leq 205^\circ ;0 .37s \leq \delta t \leq 4s$) with those previously calculated at ANTO (Ankara) and ISK (ËIstanbul)stations ($27^\circ \leq \phi \leq 59^\circ ;0.6s \leq \delta t \leq 2.4s$ and $26^\circ \leq \phi \leq 54^\circ ;0.6s \leq \delta t \leq 1.5s$) which are located at 230 and 379 km away from ISP station in central and northwestern Turkey, respectively.The backazimuthal variations of the splitting parameters at ISP station indicate a different and complex mantle polarization anisotropy for the Isparta Angle in southwestern Turkey compared to those obtained for Ankara and $\dot{I} stanbul$ stations.</p>

				<title>Magnetic anomalies across Bastar craton and PranhitaâGodavari basin in south of central India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0081-0087</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aeromagnetic anomalies over Bastar craton and Pranhita âGodavari (P âG)basin in the south of  central India could be attributed to NW âSE striking maï¬c intrusives in both the areas at variable depths.Such intrusions can be explained considering the collision of the Bastar and Dharwar cratons by the end of the Archaean and the development of tensile regimes that followed in the Paleoproterozoic,facilitating intrusions of maï¬c dykes into the continental crust.The P âG basin  area,being a zone of crustal weakness along the contact of the Bastar and Dharwar cratons, also experienced extensional tectonics.The inferred remanent magnetization of these dykes dips upwards and it is such that the dykes are oriented towards the east of the magnetic north at the time of their formation compared to their present NW âSE strike.Assuming that there was no imprint of magnetization of a later date,it is concluded that the Indian plate was located in the southern hemisphere,either independently or as part of a supercontinent,for some span of time during Paleoproterozoic and was involved in complex path of movement and rotation subsequently.  The paper presents a case study of the utility of aeromagnetic anomalies in qualitatively deducing the palaeopositions of the landmasses from the interpreted remanent magnetism of buried intrusive bodies.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0089-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The carbonate concretions occurring at the bottom of Talchir ï¬ssile shale facies preserved signatures of various trace fossils along with a cast of doubtful organisms and cyanobacterial mat structures. The host shale deposited under glacial melt water fed lacustrine condition.The concretions,formed in poorly oxygenated conditions,are either of syndepositional origin and/or deposited a little below the sediment water interface and were later exhumed to the depositional surface due to erosion of soft mud overlying them.</p>
					<p>The trace fossils are both megascopic and microscopic in nature.The megascopic trace fossils are identiï¬ed on the basis of their morphology as \textit {Monocraterion} and \textit {Rhizocorallium}. Some of the megascopic structures described remain problematic at present.The microscopic trace fossils are formed due to the activity of marine meiofauna (possibly by nematodes),which,although produced morphologically show similar traces of known larger ichnogeneras but much smaller than them. The discovery of these trace fossils apparently indicate the in ï¬ux of saline water into a lacustrine domain during the Talchir sedimentation at Giridih basin.Moreover, presence of the above two megascopic trace fossils in the marine lacustrine carbonate concretions may lead researchers to consider their much wider environmental signiï¬cance than hitherto believed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A completely new set of formulas,based on matrix algebra,has been suggested for the calculation of  the CIPW norm for igneous rocks to achieve highly consistent and accurate norms.The suggested sequence of derivation of the normative minerals greatly deviates from the sequence followed in the classical scheme.The formulas are presented in a form convenient for error-free implementation in computer programs.Accurate formulas along with the use of variable molecular weights for CaO and FeO;corrected formula weights for apatite,pyrite and ï¬uorite;and suggested measures to avoid signiï¬cant rounding off errors to achieve absolute match between the sum of the input weights of the oxides and the sum of the weights of the estimated normative minerals.Using an analogous procedure for determining the oxidation ratios of igneous rocks as used in the SINCLAS system of Ver ma \textit {et al} (2002,2003),the suggested calculation scheme exactly reproduces their results except for apatite for reasons explained in the text,but with a superior match between the totals for about 11,200 analyses representing rocks of a wide range of composition.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Analysis of ï¬fty four (1951--2004)years of daily energetics of zonal waves derived from NCEP/ NCAR wind (\textit {u} and \textit {v} data and daily rainfall received over the Indian landmass (real time data) during southwest monsoon season (1 June--30 September)indicate that energetics (momentum transport and kinetic energy)of lower tropospheric ultra-long waves (waves 1 and 2)of low latitudes hold a key to intra-seasonal variability of monsoon rainfall over India.</p>
					<p>Correlation coefficient between climatology of daily (122 days)energetics of ultra-long waves and climatology of daily rainfall over Indian landmass is 0.9.The relation is not only signiï¬cant but also has a predictive potential.The normalised plot of both the series clearly indicates that the response period of rainfall to the energetics is of 5--10 days during the onset phase and 4--7 days during the withdrawal phase of monsoon over India.During the established phase of monsoon, both the series move hand-in-hand.Normalised plot of energetics of ultra-long waves and rainfall for individual year do not show marked deviation with respect to climatology.These results are ï¬rst of its kind and are useful for the short range forecast of rainfall over India.</p>

				<title>Summer monsoon onset over Kerala: New definition and prediction</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0123-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The summer monsoon onset over Kerala (MOK)marks the beginning of the rainy season for the country.Associated with the MOK,signiï¬cant transitions of large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns are observed over the Asia âPaciï¬c region.In this study,a new method for the objective identiï¬cation of MOK,based on large scale circulation features and rainfall over Kerala,is discussed.Further,a set of empirical models based on the principal component regression (PCR)technique was developed for the prediction of the date of MOK by keeping in mind the IMD âs operational forecasting service requirements.Predictors for the models were derived using correlation analysis from the thermal,convective and circulation patterns.Only ï¬ve predictors pertaining to the second half of April were used in the ï¬rst model (Model-1)so that the prediction of MOK can be prepared by the end of April itself.The second model (Model-2)used four additional predictors pertaining up to the ï¬rst half of May along with two predictors used in the Model-1 for update prediction at the end of the ï¬rst half of May.To develop each of the PCR models, Principal Components Analysis (PCA)of the respective predictor data was carried out followed by regression analysis of ï¬rst two principal components (PCs)with the date of MOK.Both these models showed good skill in predicting the date of MOK during the independent test period of 1997 â2007.The root mean square error (RMSE)of the predictions from both the models during the independent test period was about four days which was nearly half the RMSE of the predictions based on climatology.</p>

				<title>Linear genetic programming for time-series modelling of daily flow rate</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0137-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study linear genetic programming (LGP),which is a variant of Genetic Programming,and two versions of Neural Networks (NNs)are used in predicting time-series of daily ï¬ow rates at a station on Schuylkill River at Berne,PA,USA.Daily ï¬ow rate at present is being predicted based on different time-series scenarios.For this purpose,various LGP and NN models are calibrated with training sets and validated by testing sets.Additionally,the robustness of the proposed LGP and NN models are evaluated by application data,which are used neither in training nor at testing stage.The results showed that both techniques predicted the ï¬ow rate data in quite good agreement with the observed ones,and the predictions of LGP and NN are challenging.The performance of LGP,which was moderately better than NN,is very promising and hence supports the use of LGP in predicting of river ï¬ow data.</p>

				<title>Distribution of particulate carbohydrate species in the Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0147-0156</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Suspended particulate matter (SPM)of surface seawaters was collected during December 2003 to October 2004 at 10 stations in the Bay of Bengal,and analyzed for particulate organic carbon (POC),total particulate nitrogen (TPN),total particulate carbohydrate (TPCHO)and total particulate uronic acids (TPURA).The concentrations of POC,TPCHO and TPURA varied from 4.80 to 29.12,0.85 to 4.24,0.09 to 0.91 $\mu $ C,respectively.The TPCHO-C and TPURA-C accounted for 6.6 â32.5%and 0.87 â3.65%of POC.The trends observed for the distribution of these compounds were generally similar to those recorded for the distribution of chlorophyll \textit {a} (Chl \textit {a}) .The C/N ratios varied from 3.2 to 22.3 with most of the values being &mt; 10.This suggests that the organic matter was mostly derived from phytoplankton and bacteria.Relatively low C/N ratios and high TPCHO yield imply that freshly derived organic matter was present during SWM and FIM.Our data suggest that the quality and quantity of organic matter varied spatially and seasonally.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coral microatolls were examined from North Andaman and Little Andaman to understand the relative sea level change due to vertical tectonic deformation above the subduction interface.The highest level of survival of coral microatoll before the 26 December,2004 earthquake at eastern coast of North Andaman has been determined by Global Ocean Tide Model.The present position of recently dead ï¬at top microatoll with preserved internal structure at the eastern coast of North Andaman mainland indicates 31.21 cm uplift due to the 26 December,2004 earthquake.Comparatively old cup shaped microatoll at the eastern fringe of North Andaman group of islands and highly bioeroded fossil microatolls at the intertidal zone of Little Andaman bear the signature of permanent vertical deformation in the past.</p>

				<title>Some observations from radiometric â8 bitâ data of sediment thin sections based on alternative petrographic image analysis method</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0163-0173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with the experiment of sediment microstructure analysis especially microfabric mapping by digital imaging.For that purpose the greyscale images (Red band from RGB combination)of the thin sections have been prepared from the selected 12 samples.The basis of this mapping is the reï¬ectance capacity of different sediments which is inï¬uenced by the physical parameters like grain size and colour.The reï¬ectances of different sediments are represented in digital format by different DN values from 0 â255 within the radiometric ranges of â8 bit âdata. Density slicing has been chosen as the method of microstructure mapping in this research.This study shows that lower DN values normally present dark coloured coarser sand and clay while higher DN values present light coloured ï¬ner sediment samples.In the selected samples for this study the maximum DN value has been found from micaceous materials.Another remarkable thing observed from the microfabric mapping is that the presence of coarser sediments forms complex microfabric pattern than the ï¬ner sediments in the study area.Though this method have some demerits,still its simple technique can be very useful for accurate microstructure analysis.</p>

				<title>Equatorial modes observed in atmospheric variables</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0181-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wavenumber âfrequency spectral analysis of different atmospheric variables has been carried out using 25 years of data.The area considered is the tropical belt $25^\circ S â25^\circ N$. A combined FFT- wavelet analysis method has been used for this purpose.Variables considered are outgoing long- wave radiation (OLR),850 hPa divergence,zonal and meridional winds at 850,500 and 200 hPa levels,sea level pressure and 850 hPa geopotential height.It is shown that the spectra of different variables have some common properties,but each variable also has few features different from the rest. While Kelvin mode is prominent in OLR and zonal winds,it is not clearly observed in pressure and geopotential height ï¬elds;the latter two have a dominant wavenumber zero mode not seen in other variables except in meridional wind at 200 hPa and 850 hPa divergences.Different dominant modes in the tropics show signiï¬cant variations on sub-seasonal time scales.</p>

				<title>A diagnosis of rainfall over South America during 1997/98 El Ni$\tilde{n} $o and 1998/99 La Ni$\tilde{n} $a events: Comparison between TRMM PR and GPCP rainfall estimates</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0193-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comparison between TRMM PR rainfall estimates and rain gauge data from ANEEL and combined gauge/satellite data from GPCP over South America (SA)is made.In general,the annual and seasonal regional characteristics of rainfall over SA are qualitatively well reproduced by TRMM PR and GPCP.It is found that over most of SA GPCP exceeds TRMM PR rainfall.The largest positive differences between GPCP and TRMM PR data occur in the north SA,northwestern and central Amazonia.However,there are regions where GPCP rainfall is lower than TRMM PR,particularly in the Paciï¬c coastal regions and in southern Brazil.We suggest that the cause for the positive differences GPCP minus TRMM PR rainfall are related to the fact that satellite observations based on infrared radiation and outgoing longwave radiance sensors overestimate convective rainfall in GPCP and the cause for the negative differences are due to the random errors in TRMM PR.Rainfall differences in the latter phases of the 1997/98 El Ni Ëno and 1998/99 La Ni Ëna are analyzed.The results showed that the rainfall anomalies are generally higher in GPCP than in TRMM PR,however,as in the mean annual case,there are regions where the rainfall in GPCP is lower than in TRMM PR.The higher positive (negative)differences between the rainfall anomalies in GPCP and TRMM PR,which occur in the central Amazonia (southern Brazil),are reduced (increased) in the El Ni Ëno event.This is due to the fact that during the El Ni Ëno episode the rainfall decreases in the central Amazonia and increases in the southern Brazil.Consequently,the overestimation of the convective rainfall by GPCP is reduced and the overestimation of the rainfall by TRMM PR is increased in these two regions,respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports quasi-periodic pulsing hiss emissions recorded during daytime in the frequency range of 50 Hz â15 kHz at low latitude station Jammu (geomag.lat.=$22^\circ 26^\prime N$; \textit {L} =1.17). It is noted that pulsing VLF emissions are a rare phenomena at low latitudes.The various spectrograms of pulsing VLF hiss emissions presented in this paper clearly show band limited spectrums regularly pulsing with almost equal period of the order of few seconds in the frequency range of $\sim 3--8$ kHz. Generation and propagation mechanism of these emissions are brieï¬y discussed.</p>

				<title>Appraisal of groundwater resources in an island condition</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0217-0229</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A group of 36 coral islands is being scattered in the Arabian Sea of the western coast of India. On such islands,groundwater is the only source of fresh water for the islanders.The demand for groundwater is increasing every year due to growing population and urbanization.On the other side the peculiar hydrologic,geologic and geomorphic features restrict the availability of groundwater. Thus a proper understanding of the groundwater condition is important in order to meet this increasing demand and also to formulate future development and management strategies.Detailed hydrogeological,geophysical and hydrochemical studies had been carried out to identify potential fresh groundwater resources and quantify vulnerable parts of Andrott Island,Union Territory of Lakshadweep.Systematic collection and analysis of hydrological,geophysical and hydrochemical data gives an early signal of deterioration in groundwater quality in the peripheral parts of eastern and western coasts of this island and it suggests immediate measures for arresting the deterioration in groundwater quality as well as augmentation for restoration of aquifer in some parts of the island.</p>

				<title>Tectonic controls on the geomorphic evolution of alluvial fans in the Piedmont Zone of Ganga Plain, Uttarakhand, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0245-0259</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Piedmont Zone is the least studied part of the Ganga Plain.The northern limit of the Piedmont Zone is deï¬ned by the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT)along which the Himalaya is being thrust over the alluvium of the Ganga Plain.Interpretation of satellite imagery,Digital Terrain Models (DTMs)and ï¬eld data has helped in the identiï¬cation and mapping of various morpho-tectonic features in the densely forested and cultivated Piedmont Zone in the Kumaun region of the Uttarakhand state of India.The Piedmont Zone has formed as a result of coalescing alluvial fans,alluvial aprons and talus deposits.The fans have differential morphologies and aggradation processes within a common climatic zone and similar litho-tectonic setting of the catchment area. Morphotectonic analysis reveals that the fan morphologies and aggradation processes in the area are mainly controlled by the ongoing tectonic activities.Such activities along the HFT and transverse faults have controlled the accommodation space by causing differential subsidence of the basin,and aggradation processes by causing channel migration,channel incision and shifting of depocentres.The active tectonic movements have further modiï¬ed the landscape of the area in the form of tilted alluvial fan,gravel ridges,terraces and uplifted gravels.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Repeated measurements of the total geomagnetic ï¬eld on the ï¬ve proï¬les have revealed a picture of stress-induced tectonomagnetic effect in the form of secular variation of the total geomagnetic ï¬eld in the tectonically and seismically active area of Jabalpur and adjoining areas of the Narmada--Son lineament (NSL),central India.For this experiment,a reference base station was established within the study area at Jabalpur.Using proton precession magnetometers with a sensitivity of 0.1 nT, simultaneous measurements of total geomagnetic ï¬eld were made annually at the base and all ï¬eld stations.Five cycles of repeated observations have been performed between 2003 and 2007.For data analysis,a difference method has been applied and the residuals have been calculated as secular variations of the total geomagnetic ï¬eld with values ranging from $\pm 0 .1nT$ to about &mt; $\pm 14.6nT/yr$ over the different stations.The anomalies in secular variation of the total geomagnetic ï¬eld may be related to anomalous accumulation of tectonic stresses and tensions on the deep fault zones and crustal blocks due to recent geodynamic processes and active geological inhomogeneities in the NSL.</p>

				<title>Weakening of lower tropospheric temperature gradient between Indian landmass and neighbouring oceans and its impact on Indian monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0273-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study shows that in the scenario of global warming temperature gradient (TG) between Indian landmass and Arabian Sea/Bay of Bengal is significantly decreasing in the lower troposphere with maxima around 850 hPa. TG during pre-monsoon (March to May) is reducing at a significant rate of $0.036^\circ /year$ (Arabian Sea) and 0.030^\circ /year$ (Bay of Bengal). The above alarming results are based on sixty years (1948â2007) of daily temperature and wind data extracted from CDAS-NCEP/NCAR reanalysis datasets. TG based on ERA-40 data also indicates a decreasing trend of $0.0229^\circ /year$ and $0.0397^\circ /year$ for Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal respectively. As TG is not governed by any type of significant oscillation, there is a possibility of TG tending to zero. It is further observed that the rate of warming over the oceans is more than that over the land which has resulted into the weakening of TG. Pre-monsoon TG has significant correlations with</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All India Seasonal Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR),</li>
						<li>kinetic energy of waves 1 and 2 at 850 hPa,</li>
						<li>kinetic energy, and</li>
						<li>stream function at 850 hPa over Indian landmass during monsoon season.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Except AISMR, the decreasing trends observed in all the above parameters are significant. All India rainfall for July and August together shows a significant decreasing trend of 0.995mm/year. Reducing number of depressions and cyclonic storms and increasing number of break days during monsoon over India are the reflections of the weakening of TG.</p>

				<title>A case study of atmospheric boundary layer features during winter over a tropical inland station â Kharagpur ($22.32^\circ N, 87.32^\circ E$)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0281-0293</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The local weather and air quality over a region are greatly influenced by the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) structure and dynamics. ABL characteristics were measured using a tethered balloon-sonde system over Kharagpur ($22.32^\circ N, 87.32^\circ E$, 40m above MSL), India, for the period 7 December 2004 to 30 December 2004, as a part of the Indian Space Research Organizationâ Geosphere Biosphere Program (ISROâGBP) Aerosol Land Campaign II. High-resolution data of pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and wind direction were archived along with surface layer measurements using an automatic weather station. This paper presents the features of ABL, like ABL depth and nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) depth. The sea surface winds from Quikscat over the oceanic regions near the experiment site were analyzed along with the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis winds over Kharagpur to estimate the convergence of wind, moisture and vorticity to understand the observed variations in wind speed and relative humidity, and also the increased aerosol concentrations. The variation of ventilation coefficient (\textit {VC}), a factor determining the air pollution potential over a region, is also discussed in detail.</p>

				<title>Mesoscale model simulation of low level equatorial winds over Borneo during the haze episode of September 1997</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0295-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The large-scale vegetation fires instigated by the local farmers during the dry period of the major El NiËno event in 1997 can be considered as one of the worst environmental disasters that have occurred in southeast Asia in recent history. This study investigated the local meteorology characteristics of an equatorial environment within a domain that includes the northwestern part of Borneo from the 17 to 27 September 1997 during the height of the haze episode by utilizing a limited area three-dimensional meteorological and dispersion model, The Air Pollution Model (TAPM).</p>
					<P>Daily land and sea breeze conditions near the northwestern coast of Borneo in the state ofSarawak, Malaysia were predicted with moderate success by the index of agreement of less than one between the observed and simulated values for wind speed and a slight overprediction of 2.3 of the skill indicator that evaluates the standard deviation to the observed values. The innermost domain of study comprises an area of 24,193 $km^2$, from approximately $109^\circ E to 111^\circ E$, and from $1^\circ N to 2.3^\circ N$, which includes a part of the South China Sea. Tracer analysis of air particles that were sourced in the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo verified the existence of the landward and shoreward movements of the air during the simulation of the low level wind field. Polluted air particles were transported seawards during night-time, and landwards during daytime, highlighting the recirculation features of aged and newer air particles during the length of eleven days throughout the model simulation. Near calm conditions at low levels were simulated by the trajectory analysis from midnight to mid-day on the 22 of September 1997. Low-level turbulence within the planetary boundary layer in terms of the total kinetic energy was weak, congruent with the weak strength of low level winds that reduced the ability of the air to transport the pollutants.</P>
					<P>Statistical evaluation showed that parameters such as the systematic RMSE and unsystematic RMSE between the observed and simulated values indicated the modest skill of the model in simulating the low level winds. Otherwise, the equatorial meteorological parameters such as wind speed and temperature were successfully simulated by the model with comparatively high correlation coefficients, lower RMSEs and moderately high indices of agreement with observed values.</P>

				<title>Track prediction of very severe cyclone âNargisâ using high resolution weather research forecasting (WRF) model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0309-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The recent very severe cyclonic storm (VSCS) âNargisâ over the Bay of Bengal caused widespread destruction over Myanmar after hitting the coast on 2 May 2008. The real time forecasting of the VSCS âNargisâ was a very difficult task as it did not follow the normal westerly/northwesterly track. In the present study, a detailed diagnostic analysis of the system âNargisâ is carried out initially to investigate the features associated with this unusual movement and subsequently the real time forecast of VSCS âNargisâ using high resolution advanced version weather research forecasting (WRF) model is presented. The advanced research WRF model was run for 72 h at 27 km and 20 km resolutions with 28, 29, 30 April and 1 May as the initial conditions. The diagnostic study indicates that the recurvature of the system âNargisâ was mainly associated with:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>upper level southerly/southwesterly steering wind at 200 hPa level associated with anticyclonic circulation over southeastern sector of the centre of the system,</li>
						<li>higher SST ($29^\circ C$ or more) with higher positive anomalies over the region to the northeast of the cyclone centre, and</li>
						<li>large negative 24 h pressure changes and large vorticity maximum to the east of the system.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The real time track forecast using theWRF model run at 27 km and 20 km resolution based on the initial conditions of 28 April (when the system was only 550 km away from the Indian coast) indicated that the system had a northeasterly forecast track and was not expected to cross the Indian coast. Similarly, based on 29 April initial condition the system showed east/east-northeasterly movement towards the Myanmar coast. The east/east-northeasterly movement of the âNargisâ was persisting in the forecast based on 30 April and 1 May initial conditions with respective landfall errors of 85 km and 50 km with 27 km resolution, which reduces to 30 km and 40 km respectively with  20 km resolution, however, with a landfall time delay of about 10 h. Improvement of mean forecast errors at different forecast hours is noticed in WRF model run at higher resolution compared to that run at lower resolution. Thus, it is very clear that the advanced version WRF model had captured movement of the system reasonably well almost 3 days in advance. Consistence with the diagnostic analysis the WRF model forecast also indicates southerly/southwesterly strong steering wind at 200 hPa level and maximum pressure fall to the east of the system.</p>

				<title>Polarized microwave forward model simulations for tropical storm Fanoos</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0331-0343</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, forward radiative transfer simulations are carried out for the tropical cyclone \textit {Fanoos} that hit the coast off south India in December 2005. The in-house radiative transfer package used for this study employs the doubling and adding method to calculate radiances leaving the top of the one dimensional precipitating atmosphere. The particle drop size distribution is assumed to follow a modified gamma distribution in respect of the cloud liquid water and cloud ice water content. For precipitation, the MarshallâPalmer particle size distribution is used. All the hydrometeor particles are assumed to be spherical and Lorentz Mie theory is used to evaluate the interaction parameters like absorption, scattering coefficients and polarized scattering matrix. In order to validate the drop size distributions and interaction parameter calculations, the simulated brightness temperatures are compared with the TMI measured brightness temperatures for all the channels. For carrying out this exercise, vertical hydrometeors retrieved by TMI are used as input. The differences between simulated and measured brightness temperatures are found to be within $\pm 10%$. The maximum difference in the brightness temperatures between the present work and the Eddington model which the TRMM algorithm employs is about 4.5K. This may become significant when retrieval of precipitation is attempted by combining the forward model with a suitable retrieval strategy, under tropical conditions.</p>

				<title>Comparison of two split-window methods for retrieving land surface temperature from MODIS data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0345-0353</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in environment and earth science study, especially for monitoring drought. The objective of this work is a comparison of two split-window methods: Mao method and Sobrino method, for retrieving LST using MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data in North China Plain. The results show that the max, min and mean errors of Mao method are 1.33K, 1.54K and 0.13K lower than the standard LST product respectively; while those of Sobrino method are 0.73K, 1.46K and 1.50K higher than the standard respectively. Validation of the two methods using LST product based on weather stations shows a good agreement between the standard and Sobrino method, with RMSE of 1.17K, whereas RMSE of Mao method is 1.85K. Finally, the study introduces the Sobmao method, which is based on Sobrino method but simplifies the estimation of atmospheric water vapour content using Mao method. The Sobmao method has almost the same accuracy with Sobrino method. With high accuracy and simplification of water vapour content estimation, the Sobmao method is recommendable in LST inversion for good application in Ningxia region, the northwest China, with mean error of 0.33K and the RMSE value of 0.91K.</p>

				<title>SCS-CN and GIS-based approach for identifying potential water harvesting sites in the Kali Watershed, Mahi River Basin, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0355-0368</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kali sub-watershed is situated in the semi-arid region of Gujarat, India and forms a part of the Mahi River Watershed. This watershed receives an average annual rainfall of 900mm mainly between July and September. Due to high runoff potential, evapo-transpiration and poor infiltration, drought like situation prevails in this area from December to June almost every year. In this paper, augmentation of water resource is proposed by construction of runoff harvesting structures like check dam, percolation pond, farm pond, well and subsurface dyke. The site suitability for different water harvesting structures is determined by considering spatially varying parameters like runoff potential, slope, fracture pattern and micro-watershed area. GIS is utilised as a tool to store, analyse and integrate spatial and attribute information pertaining to runoff, slope, drainage and fracture. The runoff derived by SCS-CN method is a function of runoff potential which can be expressed in terms of runoff coefficient (ratio between the runoff and rainfall) which can be classified into three classes, viz., high (&lt; 40%), moderate (20â40%) and low (&mt; 20%). In addition to IMSD, FAO specifications for water harvesting/recharging structures, parameters such as effective storage, rock mass permeability are herein considered to augment effective storage. Using the overlay and decision tree concepts in GIS, potential water harvesting sites are identified. The derived sites are field investigated for suitability and implementation. In all, the accuracy of the site selection at implementation level varies from 80â100%.</p>

				<title>Wind-driven estuarine turbidity maxima in Mandovi Estuary, central west coast of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0369-0377</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Systematic studies on the suspended particulate matter (SPM) measured on a seasonal cycle in the Mandovi Estuary, Goa indicate that the average concentrations of SPM at the regular station are $\sim $20mg/l, 5mg/l, 19mg/l and 5mg/l for JuneâSeptember, OctoberâJanuary, FebruaryâApril and May, respectively. SPM exhibits low-to-moderate correlation with rainfall indicating that SPM is also influenced by other processes. Transect stations reveal that the SPM at sea-end stations of the estuary are at least two orders of magnitude greater than those at the river-end during the monsoon. Estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) of nearly similar magnitude occurs at the same location in two periods, interrupted by a period with very low SPM concentrations. The ETM occurring in JuneâSeptember is associated with low salinities; its formation is attributed to the interactions between strong southwesterly winds ($5.1â5.6ms^{â1}$) and wind-induced waves and tidal currents and, dominant easterly river flow at the mouth of the estuary. The ETM occurring in FebruaryâApril is associated with high salinity and is conspicuous. The strong NW and SW winds ($3.2â3.7ms^{â1}$) and wind-driven waves and currents seem to have acted effectively at the mouth of the estuary in developing turbidity maximum. The impact of sea breeze appears nearly same as that of trade winds and cannot be underestimated in sediment resuspension and deposition.</p>

					<p>Understanding deformation mechanisms in Himalayan rocks is a challenging proposition due to the complex nature of the deformed rocks and their genesis. Crustal deformation in the Himalayan thrust belt typically occurs in elastico-frictional (EF) or quasi-plastic (QP) regimes at depths controlled mainly by regional strain-rate and geothermal gradient. However, material property, grain-size and their progressive changes during deformation are also important controlling factors. We present evidence of EF deformation from Gondwana rocks developed during the emplacement of one of the frontal horses (Jorthang horse) in the Lesser Himalayan Duplex (LHD) structure associated with Lesser Himalayan rocks in the footwall of the Ramgarh thrust in the Rangit window near Jorthang in the Sikkim Himalaya. The rocks in the horse exhibit systematic changes in microand meso-structures from an undeformed protolith to cataclasite suggesting that it was emplaced under elastico-frictional conditions. Meso- to micro-scale shear fractures are seen developed in Gondwana sandstone and slate while intercalated fine-grained shale-coal-carbonates are deformed by cataclastic flow suggesting that material property and grain-size have played an important role in the deformation of the Jorthang horse. In contrast, the hanging wall schists and quartzites of the Ramgarh thrust exhibit quasi-plastic deformation structures. This suggests that the Jorthang horse was emplaced under shallower crustal conditions than the antiformally folded Ramgarh thrust sheet even though the Ramgarh sheet presently overlies the Jorthang horse.</p>

				<title>Laboratory technique for quantitative thermal emissivity measurements of geological samples</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0391-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal infrared spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the compositional analysis of geological materials. The spectral feature in the mid-IR region is diagnostic of the mineralogy and spectral signatures of mixtures of minerals that add linearly, and therefore, can be used as an important tool to determine the mineralogy of rocks in the laboratory and remotely for planetary exploration. The greatest challenge in the emission measurement lies in the measurement of the weak thermal photons emitted from geological materials in a laboratory setup, and accurately records the temperature of the rock sample. The present work pertains to the details of a new Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) laboratory that has been developed under the ISRO Planetary Science and Exploration (PLANEX) programme, for emission related mineralogical investigations of planetary surfaces. The focus of the paper is on the acquisition and calibration technique for obtaining emissivity, and the deconvolution procedure to obtain the modal abundances of the thermal emission spectra in the range of 6â25 $\mu $ m using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The basic technique is adopted from the work of Ruff \textit {et al} (1997). This laboratory at the Department of Earth Sciences, IIT-Bombay is currently developing pure end mineral library of mineral particulates (&mt; 65 $\mu $m), and adding new end members to the existing ASU spectral library. The paper argues the need for considering Lunar Orbiter Thermal Emission Spectrometer (LOTES) for future Indian Moon mission programme (Chandrayan-II) to determine evidences of varied lithologies on the lunar surface.</p>

				<title>Magnetic anomalies of offshore Krishna-Godavari Basin, eastern continental margin of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0405-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The marine magnetic data acquired from offshore KrishnaâGodavari (KâG) basin, eastern continental margin of India (ECMI), brought out a prominent NEâSW trending feature, which could be explained by a buried structural high formed by volcanic activity. The magnetic anomaly feature is also associated with a distinct negative gravity anomaly similar to the one associated with $85^\circ E$ Ridge. The gravity low could be attributed to a flexure at the Moho boundary, which could in turn be filled with the volcanic material. Inversion of the magnetic and gravity anomalies was also carried out to establish the similarity of anomalies of the two geological features (structural high on the margin and the $85^\circ E$ Ridge) and their interpretations. In both cases, the magnetic anomalies were caused dominantly by the magnetization contrast between the volcanic material and the surrounding oceanic crust, whereas the low gravity anomalies are by the flexures of the order of 3â4 km at Moho boundary beneath them. The analysis suggests that both structural high present in offshore KrishnaâGodavari basin and the $85^\circ E$ Ridge have been emplaced on relatively older oceanic crust by a common volcanic process, but at discrete times, and that several of the gravity lows in the Bay of Bengal can be attributed to flexures on the Moho, each created due to the load of volcanic material.</p>

				<title>Impact of vegetation on the simulation of seasonal monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent using a regional model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0413-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The change in the type of vegetation fraction can induce major changes in the local effects such as local evaporation,surface radiation,etc.,that in turn induces changes in the model simulated  outputs.The present study deals with the effects of vegetation in climate modeling over the Indian  region using the MM5 mesoscale model.The main objective of the present study is to investigate the impact of vegetation dataset derived from SPOT satellite by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization)\textit {versus} that of USGS (United States Geological Survey)vegetation dataset on the simulation of the Indian summer monsoon.The present study has been conducted for ï¬ve monsoon seasons (1998 â2002),giving emphasis over the two contrasting southwest monsoon seasons of 1998 (normal)and 2002 (deï¬cient).</p>
					<p>The study reveals mixed results on the impact of vegetation datasets generated by ISRO and USGS on the simulations of the monsoon.Results indicate that the ISRO data has a positive impact on the simulations of the monsoon over northeastern India and along the western coast.The MM5- USGS has greater tendency of overestimation of rainfall.It has higher standard deviation indicating that it induces a dispersive effect on the rainfall simulation.Among the ï¬ve years of study,it is seen that the RMSE of July and JJAS (June âJuly âAugust âSeptember)for All India Rainfall is mostly lower for MM5-ISRO.Also,the bias of July and JJAS rainfall is mostly closer to unity for MM5-ISRO.The wind ï¬elds at 850 hPa and 200 hPa are also better simulated by MM5 using ISRO vegetation.The synoptic features like Somali jet and Tibetan anticyclone are simulated closer to the veri ï¬cation analysis by ISRO vegetation.The 2 m air temperature is also better simulated by ISRO vegetation over the northeastern India,showing greater spatial variability over the region. However,the JJAS total rainfall over north India and Deccan coast is better simulated using the USGS vegetation.Sensible heat ï¬ux over north-west India is also better simulated by MM5-USGS.</p>

				<title>The interaction of large scale and mesoscale environment leading to formation of intense thunderstorms over Kolkata. Part I: Doppler radar and satellite observations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0441-0466</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The weather systems that predominantly affect the eastern and northeastern parts of India during the pre-monsoon summer months (March,April and May)are severe thunderstorms,known as Nor âwesters.The storms derive their names from the fact that they frequently strike cities and towns in the southern part of West Bengal in the afternoon from the north-west direction while traveling far from its place of genesis over the Bihar plateau.The storms are devastating in nature particularly due to strong (gusty)winds,heavy rains and hails associated with it.Although these storms are well known for its power of causing damages,studies on them are relatively few due to their small  size and sparse network of observations.To address this important issue,the evolution of two Nor âwesters of 12 March and 22 May 2003 over Kolkata is studied in detail in this paper using hourly Doppler weather radar (DWR)observations and high resolution Meteosat-5 imageries.In addition,supporting meteorological reports are used to ï¬nd the large scale conditions that inï¬uence the moisture convergence and vertical wind shear.The genesis of both the storms is found to be over Bihar âJharkhand region and beyond the range of the DWR.The satellite observations are found to be useful in identifying the location and initiation of the storms.The movements of the storms are captured by the DWR estimated vertical cross-section of reï¬ectivities.The Doppler estimate shows that the 12 March storm had a vertical extent of about 10 â12 km at the time of maturity and that of 22 May reaching up to 18 km signifying deep convection associated with these events.The genesis, maturity and dissipation are well brought out by the hourly DWR and satellite imageries.The DWR observations suggest that the systems move at a speed of 20 â25 m/s.The DWR estimated precipitation shows a detailed spatial distribution around Kolkata with several localized zones of heavy rain and this is found to be well supported by the nearby station observations.This study establishes that DWR observations along with hourly satellite imageries are able to capture the evolution of Nor âwesters.The study also shows that the composite DWR-satellite information is a reliable tool for nowcasting the location,time and path of movement of Nor âwesters.Based on these observations,a conceptual model of the Nor âwester is proposed.</p>

				<title>A study of lightning activity over land and oceanic regions of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0467-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Monthly variations of lightning activity over typical land and oceanic regions of India were  examined using satellite data (OTD)for a 5-year period (1995--1999).It is noted that the nature of variation between surface air maximum temperature (\textit {T}_max) ,thunderstorm days (Th_n) ,and lightning ï¬ash count over ER and WR showed remarkable correspondence and sensitivity with each other on monthly time scale.As we move out of winter season and enter the monsoon season,via pre-monsoon season,the WR undergoes cooling relative to the ER in the range $0.1--1.2^\circ C$. As a result,WR experiences reduction of thunder days and lowering in ï¬ash count. This decrease in \textit {T}_max Th_{n} and ï¬ash count over WR may also be associated with relatively small values of \textit {T}_$\theta w$ and CAPE in comparison with similar values over ER during the monsoon sea-son.Our observation of associated reduction in Th_n and lightning count per $1^\circ C$ cooling in surface air maximum temperature suggests reduction of $\sim 3.5$ thunderstorms per station and 73 ï¬ashes. Comparison of lightning ï¬ashes between pairs of coastal,oceanic,arid-zone,hilly,and island stations reveals distinct relationship between climate regime and intensity of lightning activity. We may conclude the results of this study by saying that the overhead lightning activity is a clear reï¬ection of the status of the underlying ground-earth properties. A close and continuous monitoring of lightning activity may be considered as a need of present day scientiï¬c studies.</p>

				<title>On the diurnal ranges of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the north Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0483-0496</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the variability in the diurnal range of SST in the north Indian Ocean using \textit {in situ} measurements and tests the suitability of simple regression models in estimating the diurnal range.SST measurements obtained from 1556 drifting and 25 moored buoys were used to determine the diurnal range of SSTs.The magnitude of diurnal range of SST was highest in spring and lowest in summer monsoon.Except in spring,nearly 75 â80%of the observations reported diurnal range below $0.5^\circ C$.The distributions of the magnitudes of diurnal warming across the three basins of north Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea,Bay of Bengal and Equatorial Indian Ocean)were similar except for the  differences between the Arabian Sea and the other two basins during November--February (winter monsoon)and May.The magnitude of diurnal warming that depended on the location of temperature sensor below the water level varied with seasons.In spring,the magnitude of diurnal warming diminished drastically with the increase in the depth of temperature sensor.The diurnal range estimated using the drifting buoy data was higher than the diurnal range estimated using moored buoys ï¬tted with temperature sensors at greater depths.</p>
					<p>A simple regression model based on the peak solar radiation and average wind speed was good enough to estimate the diurnal range of SST at $\sim 1.0$ m in the north Indian Ocean during most of the seasons except under low wind-high solar radiation conditions that occur mostly during spring. The additional information on the rate of precipitation is found to be redundant for the estimation of the magnitude of diurnal warming at those depths.</p>

				<title>Seasonal variation in the biochemical composition of red seaweed (\textit {Catenella repens}) from Gangetic delta, northeast coast of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0497-0505</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The biochemical composition of red seaweeds,\textit {Catenella repens} was investigated in this present study along with subsequent analysis of relevant physico-chemical variables.In this study, the relationship between the nutritive components of this species and the ambient environmental parameters was established.Protein content varied from $2.78 \pm 0.30%$ of dry weight (stn.3)to $16.03 \pm 0.96%$ of dry weight (stn.1) with highest values during monsoon.The protein levels were positively correlated with dissolved nitrate content and negatively correlated with water temperature (except stn.3)and salinity.Carbohydrate content of this species varied signiï¬cantly (\textit {p} &mt; 0.05) during pre-monsoon between stations and the values showed positive relationship with salinity and surface water temperature.In contrast to carbo- hydrate,lipid concentration was lowest in values and varied very slightly between seasons and stations.Astaxanthin content of the seaweed species was greater in pre-monsoon than monsoon and post-monsoon in all the selected stations.Compared with the three seasons, samples of red seaweed collected in pre-monsoon has high carbohydrate âastaxanthin in contrast to protein âlipid which showed high values during monsoon.Statistical analysis computed among the environmental and biochemical parameters suggests the potential role played by the abiotic parameters on biosynthetic pathways of seaweed.This paper also highlights the inï¬uence of the nutritional quality of water that can be used for mass cultivation of \textit {Catenella repens}.</p>

				<title>Groundwater flow modelling of YamunaâKrishni interstream, a part of central Ganga Plain Uttar Pradesh</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0507-0523</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Groundwater is a major source of water for agricultural and domestic requirements in western Uttar Pradesh.Due to increasing agricultural requirements the abstraction of groundwater has increased manifold in the last two-to-three decades.The quaternary alluvium hosts the aquifer in the region.The study area forms a part of Yamuna âKrishni inter ï¬uve.Although the area hosts potential aquifers these have been adversely affected by poor management.For effective ground water management of a basin it is essential that a careful water balance study should be carried out. Keeping this in mind groundwater ï¬ow modelling was attempted to simulate the behaviour of the  ï¬ow system and evaluate the water balance.The groundwater ï¬ow modelling was carried out.The horizontal ï¬ows,seepage losses from unlined canals,recharge from rainfall and irrigation return ï¬ows were applied using different boundary packages available in Visual MODFLOW,Pro 4.1. The river aquifer interaction was simulated using the river boundary package.Hydraulic conductivity values were applied to speciï¬c zones and these ranged from 9.8 to 26.6 m/day.Recharge due to rainfall and irrigation returns were assigned to respective zones.Pumping rates of $500 m^{3}/day$, $1000 m^{3}/day$, $1500 m^{3}/day$, $2000 m^{3}/day$ and $2500 m^{3}/day$ were applied to appropriate areas of the  model to simulate areas of stress.The zone budget shows a water balance de ï¬cit for the period June 2006 to June 2007.The total recharge to the study area is 160.21 million $m^3$ (Mcum).The groundwater draft through pumping is of the order of 233.56 Mcum,thus leaving a deï¬cit balance of â 73.35 Mcum. The sensitivity of the model to input parameters was tested by varying the parameters of interest over a range of values,monitoring the response of the model and determining the root mean square error of the simulated groundwater heads to the measured heads.These analyses showed that the model is most sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and recharge parameters.Three scenarios were considered to predict aquifer responses under varied conditions of groundwater bstraction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present paper,a methodology has been developed for the mapping of snow cover in Beas basin,Indian Himalaya using AWiFS (IRS-P6)satellite data.The complexities in the mapping of snow cover in the study area are snow under vegetation,contaminated snow and patchy snow. To overcome these problems,ï¬eld measurements using spectroradiometer were carried out and reï¬ectance/snow indices trend were studied.By evaluation and validation of different topographic correction models,it was observed that,the normalized difference snow index (NDSI)values remain constant with the variations in slope and aspect and thus NDSI can take care of topography effects.Different snow cover mapping methods using snow indices are compared to ï¬nd the suitable mapping technique.The proposed methodology for snow cover mapping uses the NDSI (estimated using planetary re ï¬ectance),NIR band reï¬ectance and forest/vegetation cover information.The satellite estimated snow or non-snow pixel information using proposed methodology was validated with the snow cover information collected at three observatory locations and it was found that the algorithm classify all the sample points correctly,once that pixel is cloud free.The snow cover distribution was estimated using one year (2004 â05)cloud free satellite data and good correlation was observed between increase/decrease areal extent of seasonal snow cover and ground observed fresh snowfall and standing snow data.</p>

				<page>0539-0549</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analytical solutions are obtained for one-dimensional advection âdiffusion equation with variable coefficients in a longitudinal ï¬nite initially solute free domain,for two dispersion problems.In the ï¬rst one,temporally dependent solute dispersion along uniform ï¬ow in homogeneous domain is studied.In the second problem the velocity is considered spatially dependent due to the inhomogeneity of the domain and the dispersion is considered proportional to the square of the velocity. The velocity is linearly interpolated to represent small increase in it along the ï¬nite domain.This analytical solution is compared with the numerical solution in case the dispersion is proportional to the same linearly interpolated velocity.The input condition is considered continuous of uniform and of increasing nature both.The analytical solutions are obtained by using Laplace transformation technique.In that process new independent space and time variables have been introduced. The effects of the dependency of dispersion with time and the inhomogeneity of the domain on the solute transport are studied separately with the help of graphs.</p>

				<title>Detection of sub-basaltic sediments by a multi-parametric joint inversion approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0551-0562</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In many parts of the world sedimentary horizons with potential for hydrocarbon are located below ï¬ood basalt provinces.However,the presence of high velocity basaltic overburden makes delineation of sediments difficult due to the low velocity layer problem.Electrical and electromagnetic methods have been used in such scenarios because of the good electrical conductivity contrast between basalts and underlying sediments.However,mapping of the target sediments becomes difficult when the layer is thin as the data errors due to inherent noise lead to equivalent solutions.To tackle such difficult situations,a joint inversion scheme incorporating seismic reï¬ection and refraction, magnetotelluric and deep electrical resistivity datasets is presented. Efficacy of the scheme is tested for a model comprising a thin sedimentary layer sandwiched between a thick basalt cover and a granitic basement.The results indicate that the parameters of the target sedimentary layer are either poorly resolved or equivalent solutions are obtained by the inversion of individual datasets. Joint inversions of seismic reï¬ection (RFLS)and refraction (RFRS),or DC and  MT dataset pairs provide improved results and the range of equivalent solutions is narrowed down.Combination of any three of the above datasets leads to further narrowing of this range and improvements in mean model estimates.Joint inversion incorporating all the datasets is found to yield good estimates of the structure.Resolution analysis is carried out to appraise estimates of various model parameters obtained by jointly inverting different combinations of datasets.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The fully coupled Biot quasi-static theory of linear poroelasticity is used to study the consolidation of a poroelastic half-space caused by axisymmetric surface loads.The ï¬uid and solid constituents of the poroelastic medium are compressible and its permeability in the vertical direction is different from its permeability in the horizontal direction.An analytical solution of the governing equations is obtained by taking the displacements and the pore pressure as the  basic state variables and using a combination of the Laplace and Hankel transforms.The problem of an axisymmetric normal load is discussed in detail.An explicit analytical solution is obtained for normal disc loading.Detailed  numerical computations reveal that the anisotropy in permeability as well as the com-pressibilities of the ï¬uid and solid constituents of the poroelastic medium have signiï¬cant effects on the consolidation of the half-space.The anisotropy in permeability may accelerate the consolidation process and may lead to a dilution in the theoretical prediction of the Mandel âCryer effect. The compressibility of the solid constituents may also accelerate the consolidation process.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0575-0582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A highly diversiï¬ed, advanced and exceptionally well preserved microfossil assemblage, dominated by a planktic community,has been recorded from petrographic thin sections of chert belonging to the Sirbu Shale Formation,Bhander group,upper Vindhyans,Rajasthan.Recently, it was noticed that the assemblage also contains well preserved,large-sized acanthomorphic acritarchs, \textit {Trachyhystrichosphaera} considered to be an age-marker microfossil of the Cryogenian (850 â630 Ma).It is reported for the ï¬rst time from any Indian microfossil assemblage of Proterozoic succession.The other microfossils of the Sirbu Shale Formation are:well preserved simple,small and large-sized sphaeromorphs;complex acanthomorphs,cyanobacterial community;especially a very small-sized but exceptionally well preserved \textit {Obruchevella} ,a form resembling \textit {Volvox} colonies; cf.vase-shaped microfossils and morphologies,possibly inclining towards fungal affinity,or lichen- like symbiotic associations of algae and fungi.Till date, \textit {Trachyhystrichosphaera} has so far not been reported from successions older than the Tonian (1000 â850 Ma).It is believed that acanthomorphs attained maximum size in Ediacaran (630 â542 Ma),and further decreased in size in the Cambrian.The global paleontological literature indicates that \textit {Trachyhystrichosphaera} ranges in age from Tonian âEdiacaran (1000 â542 Ma).</p>
					<p>The present record of \textit {Trachyhystrichosphaera} as well as the earlier studies of micro and megascopic life of the Bhander Group in general and the Sirbu Shale in particular (aided by the absence of any  Cambrian fossil record)indicate that in all possibilities,age of the Sirbu Shale should lie near Cryogenian (850 â630 Ma)and the uppermost Bhander group,may incline towards the Ediacaran (630 â542 Ma).</p>

				<title>Application of Markov chain and entropy analysis to lithologic succession â an example from the early Permian Barakar Formation, Bellampalli coalfield, Andhra Pradesh, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0583-0596</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A statistical approach by a modiï¬ed Markov process model and entropy function is used to prove that the early Permian Barakar Formation of the Bellampalli coal ï¬eld developed distinct cyclicities during deposition.From results,the transition path of lithological states typical for the Bellampalli basin is as:coarse to medium-grained sandstone $\longrightarrow $ interbedded ï¬ne-grained sandstone/shale $\longrightarrow $ shale $\longrightarrow $ coal and again shale.The majority of cycles are symmetrical but asymmetrical cycles are present as well.The chi-square stationarity test implies that these cycles are stationary in space and time.The cycles are interpreted in terms of in-channel,point bar and overbank facies association in a ï¬uvial system.The randomness in the occurrence of facies within a cycle is evaluated in terms of entropy,which can be calculated from the Markov matrices.Two types of entropies are calculated for every facies state;entropy after deposition \textit {E} (post)and entropy before deposition \textit {E}(pre),which together form entropy set;the entropy for the whole system is also calculated.These values are plotted and compared with Hattori âs idealized plots,which indicate that the sequence is essentially  a symmetrical cycle (type-B of Hattroi).</p>
					<p>The symmetrical cyclical deposition of early Permian Barakar Formation is explained by the lateral migration of stream channels in response to varying discharge and rate of deposition across the alluvial plain.In addition,the ï¬ning upward cycles in the upper part enclosing thick beds of  ï¬ne clastics,as well as coal may represent differential subsidence of depositional basin.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Eco-restoration of mine overburden (OB)or abandoned mine sites is a major environmental concern.In the present investigation,an integrated approach was used to rejuvenate a high-sulphur mine OB dumping site in the Tirap Collieries,Assam,India,which is situated in the Indo-Burma mega-biodiversity hotspot.A mine OB is devoid of true soil character with poor macro and micronutrient content and contains elevated concentrations of trace and heavy metals.Planting of herbs, shrubs,cover crops and tree species at close proximity leads to primary and secondary sere state succession within a period of 3 to 5 years.A variety of plant species were screened for potential use in restoration:herbs,including \textit {Sccharum spontaneum, Cymbopogon winterianus} Jowitt (citronella), and \textit {Cymbopogon flexuosus} (lemon grass)cover plants,including \textit {Mimosa strigillosa M. striata} and \textit {M. pigra}; shrubs,including \textit {Sesbania rostrata} (dhaincha)and \textit {Cassia streata} (cassia);and tree species,including \textit {Gmelina arborea} (gomari)and \textit {Dalbergia sissoo} (sissoo).Amendment with unmined soil and bio-organic matter was required for primary establishment of some plant species. Management of these plant species at the site will ensure long term sustainable eco-restoration of the coal mine-degraded land.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Texture in high-resolution satellite images requires substantial amendment in the conventional segmentation algorithms. A measure is proposed to compute the H$\ddot{o} $lder exponent (HE) to assess the roughness or smoothness around each pixel of the image. The localized singularity information is incorporated in computing the HE. An optimum window size is evaluated so that HE reacts to localized singularity. A two-step iterative procedure for clustering the transformed HE image is adapted to identify the range of HE, densely occupied in the kernel and to partition H$\ddot{o} $lder exponents into a cluster that matches with the range. H$\ddot{o} $lder exponent values (noise or not associated with the other cluster) are clubbed to a nearest possible cluster using the local maximum likelihood analysis.</p>

				<title>Mineralogy and geochemistry of banded iron formation and iron ores from eastern India with implications on their genesis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0619-0641</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The geological complexities of banded iron formation (BIF) and associated iron ores of JillingâLangalata iron ore deposits, SinghbhumâNorth Orissa Craton, belonging to Iron Ore Group (IOG) eastern India have been studied in detail along with the geochemical evaluation of different iron ores. The geochemical and mineralogical characterization suggests that the massive, hard laminated, soft laminated ore and blue dust had a genetic lineage from BIFs aided with certain input from hydrothermal activity. The PAAS normalized REE pattern of Jilling BIF striking positive Eu anomaly, resembling those of modern hydrothermal solutions from mid-oceanic ridge (MOR). Major part of the iron could have been added to the bottom sea water by hydrothermal solutions derived from hydrothermally active anoxic marine environments. The ubiquitous presence of intercalated tuffaceous shales indicates the volcanic signature in BIF.</p>
					<p>Mineralogical studies reveal that magnetite was the principal iron oxide mineral, whose depositional history is preserved in BHJ, where it remains in the form of martite and the platy hematite is mainly the product of martite. The different types of iron ores are intricately related with the BHJ. Removal of silica from BIF and successive precipitation of iron by hydrothermal fluids of possible meteoric origin resulted in the formation of martite-goethite ore. The hard laminated ore has been formed in the second phase of supergene processes, where the deep burial upgrades the hydrous iron oxides to hematite. The massive ore is syngenetic in origin with BHJ. Soft laminated ores and biscuity ores were formed where further precipitation of iron was partial or absent.</p>

				<title>Petrography, geochemistry and geodynamic environment of potassic alkaline rocks in Eslamy peninsula, northwest of Iran</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0643-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eslamy peninsula, 360 $km^2$ in area, is located in the eastern coast of Urmieh lake in the northwest of Iran. This peninsula is a complex stratovolcano with a collapsed center, which is elevated due to later intrusions of sub-volcanic masses with trachytic to microsyenitic composition. The composite cone consists of a sequence of leucite tephrite, tephrite, leucite basanite, basanite and related pyroclastic rocks. Magmatic activities in the Eslamy peninsula begin with potassic alkaline to ultrapotassic and basic, silica-undersaturated shoshonitic rocks and they are followed by intrusions of lamprophyric dykes and end with acidic magmatism including trachytic, microsyenitic, syenitic and phonolitic domes. The original magma of the Eslamy peninsula rocks has a potassic alkaline nature (Roman type) rich in LREE and LILE and depleted of HREE. These characteristics suggest that the origin of magma can be from deep mantle with a garnet lherzolite composition, a low partial melting rate which has been contaminated by crustal materials in its way up. Fractional crystallization of olivine, diopsidic clinopyroxene and leucite played an important role in the evolution of magmas. Scrutinizing the geodynamic environment of Eslamy peninsula rocks in discrimination diagrams indicates that these rocks must have been formed in a post-collision magmatic arc setting.</p>

				<title>Hydrothermal alteration studies of gabbros from Northern Central Indian Ridge and their geodynamic implications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0659-0676</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mylonitic gabbro and altered gabbro were recovered from off-axis high and corner high locations at ridge-transform intersection, adjacent to Vityaz transform fault of the slow spreading (32â35mm/yr, full spreading) Northern Central Indian Ridge. Both the varieties show signatures of extensive alteration caused due to interaction with sea water. Mylonitic gabbro represents high temperature metamorphism ($\sim 700â800^\circ C$) and comprised of hornblende mineral which exhibits well defined foliation/gneissic appearance along with dynamically recrystallised plagioclase grains frequently intercalated with magnetite-ilmenite. Altered gabbro from corner high generally includes low temperature greenschist grade ($\sim 300^\circ C$) mineralogical assemblages: chlorite, albite, quartz and locally magnesio hornblende. Crystal plastic deformation resulted in mylonite formation and often porphyroclasts of plagioclase and clinopyroxene grains, while altered gabbro locally exhibits cataclastic texture. Presence of Vityaz transform fault and adjacent megamullion at the weakly magmatic ridge-transform intersection and off-axis high locations prompted the present scenario very much conducive for hydrothermal circulation and further facilitate the exhumation of present suite of gabbro.</p>

				<title>Existence of longitudinal waves in pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0677-0687</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium, three types of quasi-waves propagate along an arbitrary direction. In general, none of the waves is truly longitudinal. The present study finds the specific directions in a pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium along which longitudinal waves may propagate. This paper demonstrates how the propagation of longitudinal waves is affected by various pre-stresses present in the medium. The study establishes the explicit expressions defining the existence and propagation of longitudinal waves in pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium. These expressions involve not only the direction and elastic stiffness of the medium, but also the prestresses present in the medium. Changes in conditions for the existence of longitudinal waves in orthotropic, monoclinic and triclinic anisotropies are discussed in detail. The most important part of the paper is a practical aspect suggested to calculate the specific directions for the existence of longitudinal waves in pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium. In this approach, only those parameters are used that can be observed by the receiver in a geophysical experiment of wave propagation. The existence of longitudinal waves has been shown graphically using a numerical example for three types of anisotropic symmetries in elastic medium.</p>

				<page>0689-0700</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The deep sea is well known for its high faunal diversity. But the current interest in its abundant polymetallic nodules, poses a threat to the little known benthic organisms surviving in this unique environment. The present study is the first attempt to document the Indian Ocean abyssal benthic diversity of macroinvertebrates and to investigate its relation to the surface primary production (chl-\textit {a}), sediment labile organic matter, organic carbon and texture. The present study is based on 87 individuals. Altogether 39 macroinvertebrate genera were obtained from water depths of 4500â5500m from 23 box cores. Reduction in macrobenthic density was seen towards the southern latitudes. The area was dominated by deposit feeding macrobenthos. Vertically, the fauna was distributed down to 30 cm depth, with the highest faunal density in the top 2â5 cm sediment section. The values for population density were strongly correlated with surface water chl-\textit {a} and sediment protein, indicating supply of fresh organic matter as a critical factor for maintaining the deep sea benthic diversity and abundance.</p>

				<title>Mineral composite assessment of Kelkit River Basin in Turkey by means of remote sensing</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0701-0710</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Utilizing remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) tools, mineral composite characteristics (ferrous minerals (FM), iron oxide (IO), and clay minerals (CM)) of the Kelkit River Basin (15913.07 $km^2$) in Turkey were investigated and mapped. Mineral composite (MC) index maps were produced from three LANDSAT-ETM+ satellite images taken in 2000. Resulting MC index maps were summarized in nine classes by using ânatural breaksâ classification method in GIS. Employing bi-variety correlation analysis, relationships among index maps were investigated. According to the results, FM and IO index maps showed positive correlation, while CM index map is negatively correlated with FM and IO index maps. Negative correlations between iron and clay variables suggested that the dominant clay minerals of the study area might be smectite, illite, kaolinite, and chlorite, which have little or no iron content. Using field data for which their geographic coordinates had been determined by global positioning system (GPS), developed MC maps were verified, and found dependable for environmental and ecological modeling studies.</p>

				<title>Monitoring and evaluation of seasonal snow cover in Kashmir valley using remote sensing, GIS and ancillary data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0711-0720</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seasonal snow cover is a vital natural resource in the Himalaya. Monitoring of the areal extent of seasonal snow cover is important for both climatological studies as well as hydrological applications. In the present paper, snow cover monitoring was carried out to evaluate the region-wise accumulation and ablation pattern of snow cover in Pir Panjal and Shamshawari ranges of Kashmir valley. The study was carried out for the winter period between November and April of 2004â05, 2005â06 and 2006â07, using multi-temporal WiFS sensor data of IRS-1C/1D satellites. The study shows reduction in the areal extent of seasonal snow cover and rising trend of maximum temperature in three winters for the entire Kashmir valley. This has been validated with 20 years (1988â 89 to 2007â08) climatic conditions prevailed in both ranges of Kashmir valley. Region-wise study shows the spatial and temporal variability in seasonal snow cover within Kashmir valley. Advance melting was observed in Banihal and Naugam/Tangdhar regions than Gurez and Machhal regions. Different geographical parameters of these regions were studied to evaluate the influence on snow cover and it was observed that altitude and position of region with respect to mountain range are the deciding factors for retaining the seasonal snow cover for longer duration. Such region-wise study of snow cover monitoring, can provide vital inputs for planning the hydropower projects, development in habitat areas, recreational and strategic planning in the region.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of low latitude ionospheric E-region irregularities linked with daytime VHF scintillations measured from Varanasi</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0721-0732</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>VHF amplitude scintillations recorded during the daytime period from January 1991 to December 1993, April 1998 to December 1999 and January 2008 to December 2008 at low latitude station Varanasi (geographic lat. = $25^\circ 15^\prime N$; long. = $82^\circ 59^\prime E$; geomagnetic lat. = $14^\circ 55^\prime N$, long. = $154^\circ E$, dip angle = $37.3^\circ $, sub-ionospheric dip = $34^\circ $) have been analyzed to study the behaviour of ionospheric E-region irregularities during the active solar and magnetic periods. The autocorrelation functions, power spectral densities, signal de-correlation times are computed to study the temporal features of ionospheric E-region irregularities linked with daytime scintillations. Derived spectral index ranges between â2 and â9. Assuming velocity of irregularities, the characteristic lengths of the E-region irregularities are estimated. We have estimated the minimum and maximum range of scale length of sporadic-E (\textit {E_s}) irregularities to be observed over Varanasi. These results are in close agreement with those reported from this latitude region.</p>

				<title>$^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$ anomalies in Late CretaceousâEarly Tertiary strata of the Cauvery basin, south India: Constraints on nature and rate of environmental changes across KâT boundary</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The AriyalurâPondicherry sub-basin of the Cauvery basin comprises a near complete stratigraphic record of Upper CretaceousâLower Tertiary periods. Earlier studies have documented variations of clay mineral assemblages, change in microtexture of siliciclasts and many geochemical and stable isotopic anomalies far below the CretaceousâTertiary boundary (KTB) in these strata. This paper documents the occurrences of two positive $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$ anomalies preceding KâT boundary in this basin and discusses plausible causes. Analysis of trace elemental and stable isotopic profiles, sedimentation history, petrography and mineralogy of the rocks reveal that while both the anomalies may be due to increased detrital influx caused by sea level and climatic changes, the second anomaly might have been influenced by Deccan volcanism which in turn predated KTB. Record of such anomalies preceding KâT boundary supports the view of multi-causal step-wise extinction of biota across KTB.</p>

				<title>Felsic tuff from Rutland Island â A pyroclastic flow deposit in Miocene-sediments of Andaman-Java subduction complex</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0019-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The bedded felsic tuff exposed in Rutland Island, Andaman, consists of two facies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>white massive tuff with ill-defined bedding contacts (facies-A) and</li>
						<li>dominantly green tuff exhibiting well-developed turbidite sequence with up-section change from a massive unit to plane laminated units to ripple drift lamination (facies-B).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The felsic tuff is vitric to crysto-vitric in nature and contains broken crystals of quartz, feldspar, biotite and glass shards of different shapes and sizes. The bulk chemistry indicates trachyte to dacite compositional range, and high values of Zr relative to Nb and Y suggest convergent margin tectonic setting of the tuff. Dominance of cuspate shards rather than blocky shards in both the facies indicates subaerial eruption of the pyroclasts. Recurrence of turbidites as well as good sorting of crystals and glass suggest that subaerially erupted ash was transported in subaqueous condition. The bed pattern supports rapid deposition of facies- A from high concentration turbidity flow whereas facies-B could be produced by decrease in grain size and suspended-load fallout rate of turbidity current. Regional correlation suggests that felsic volcanism in Sumatra was the source for such early Miocene to middle Miocene tuff.</p>

				<title>Inversion of quasi-3D DC resistivity imaging data using artificial neural networks</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of this paper is to investigate the applicability of artificial neural networks in inverting quasi-3D DC resistivity imaging data. An electrical resistivity imaging survey was carried out along seven parallel lines using a dipoleâdipole array to confirm the validation of the results of an inversion using an artificial neural network technique. The model used to produce synthetic data to train the artificial neural network was a homogeneous medium of 100$\Omega $m resistivity with an embedded anomalous body of 1000$\Omega $m resistivity. The network was trained using 21 datasets (comprising 12159 data points) and tested on another 11 synthetic datasets (comprising 6369 data points) and on real field data. Another 24 test datasets (comprising 13896 data points) consisting of different resistivities for the background and the anomalous bodies were used in order to test the interpolation and extrapolation of network properties. Different learning paradigms were tried in the training process of the neural network, with the resilient propagation paradigm being the most efficient. The number of nodes, hidden layers, and efficient values for learning rate and momentum coefficient have been studied. Although a significant correlation between results of the neural network and the conventional robust inversion technique was found, the ANN results show more details of the subsurface structure, and the RMS misfits for the results of the neural network are less than seen with conventional methods. The interpreted results show that the trained network was able to invert quasi-3D electrical resistivity imaging data obtained by dipoleâdipole configuration both rapidly and accurately.</p>

				<title>Influence of climatic teleconnections on the temporal isotopic variability as recorded in a firn core from the coastal Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0041-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ice and firn core studies provide one of the most valuable tools for understanding the past climate change. In order to evaluate the temporal isotopic variability recorded in ice and its relevance to environmental changes, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were studied in a firn core from coastal Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. The annual $\delta ^{18}O$ profile of the core shows a close relation to the El Ni$\tilde{n} $o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. The ENSO indices show significant correlation with the surface air temperatures and $\delta ^{18}O$ values of this region during the austral summer season and support an additional influence related to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The correlation between the combined ENSO-SAM index and the summer $\delta ^{18}O$ record seems to have been caused through an atmospheric mechanism. Snow accumulation in this region illustrates a decreasing trend with opposite relationships with $\delta ^{18}O$ data and surface air temperature prior and subsequent to the year 1997. A reorganization of the local water cycle is further indicated by the deuterium excess data showing a shift around 1997, consistent with a change in evaporation conditions. The present study thus illustrates the utility of ice-core studies in the reconstruction of past climate change and suggests possible influence of climatic teleconnections on the snow accumulation rates and isotopic profiles of snow in the coastal regions of east Antarctica.</p>

				<title>Recent trends in pre-monsoon daily temperature extremes over India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0051-0065</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extreme climate and weather events are increasingly being recognized as key aspects of climate change. Pre-monsoon season (MarchâMay) is the hottest part of the year over almost the entire South Asian region, in which hot weather extremes including heat waves are recurring natural hazards having serious societal impacts, particularly on human health. In the present paper, recent trends in extreme temperature events for the pre-monsoon season have been studied using daily data on maximum and minimum temperatures over a well-distributed network of 121 stations for the period 1970â2005. For this purpose, time series of extreme temperature events have been constructed for India as a whole and seven homogeneous regions, viz., Western Himalaya (WH),  Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), North Central (NC), East coast (EC), West coast (WC) and  Interior Peninsula (IP).</p>
					<p>In general, the frequency of occurrence of hot days and hot nights showed widespread increasing trend, while that of cold days and cold nights has shown widespread decreasing trend. The frequency of the occurrence of hot days is found to have significantly increased over EC, WC and IP, while that of cold days showed significant decreasing trend over WH and WC. The three regions EC, WC and NW showed significant increasing trend in the frequency of hot nights. For India as whole, the frequency of hot days and nights showed increasing trend while cold days and nights showed decreasing trends. Day-to-day fluctuations of pre-monsoon daily maximum and minimum temperatures have also been studied for the above regions. The results show that there is no significant change in day-to-day magnitude of fluctuations of pre-monsoon maximum and minimum temperatures. However, the results generally indicate that the daily maximum and minimum temperatures are becoming less variable within the season.</p>

				<title>Study of land surface temperature and spectral emissivity using multi-sensor satellite data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0067-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, an attempt has been made to estimate land surface temperatures (LST) and spectral emissivities over a hard rock terrain using multi-sensor satellite data. The study area, of about 6000 $km^2$, is a part of SinghbhumâOrissa craton situated in the eastern part of India. TIR data from ASTER, MODIS and Landsat ETM+ have been used in the present study. Telatemp Model AG-42D Portable Infrared Thermometer was used for ground measurements to validate the results derived from satellite (MODIS/ASTER) data. LSTs derived using Landsat ETM+ data of two different dates have been compared with the satellite data (ASTER and MODIS) of those two dates. Various techniques, viz., temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm, gray body adjustment approach in TES algorithm, Split-Window algorithms and Single Channel algorithm along with NDVI based emissivity approach have been used. LSTs derived from bands 31 and 32 of MODIS data using Split-Window algorithms with higher viewing angle ($50^\circ $) (LST1 and LST2) are found to have closer agreement with ground temperature measurements (ground LST) over waterbody, Dalma forest and Simlipal forest, than that derived from ASTER data (TES with AST 13). However, over agriculture land, there is some uncertainty and difference between the measured and the estimated LSTs for both validation dates for all the derived LSTs. LST obtained using Single Channel algorithm with NDVI based emissivity method in channel 13 of ASTER data has yielded closer agreement with ground measurements recorded over vegetation and mixed lands of low spectral contrast. LST results obtained with TIR band 6 of Landsat ETM+ using Single Channel algorithm show close agreement over Dalma forest, Simlipal forest and waterbody with LSTs obtained using MODIS and ASTER data for a different date. Comparison of LSTs shows good agreement with ground measurements in thermally homogeneous area. However, results in agriculture area with less homogeneity show difference of LST up to $2^\circ C$. The results of the present study indicate that continuous monitoring of LST and emissivity can be undertaken with the aid of multi-sensor satellite data over a thermally homogeneous region.</p>

				<title>On the modeling of electrical boundary layer (electrode layer) and derivation of atmospheric electrical profiles, eddy diffusion coeffcient and scales of electrode layer</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0075-0086</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrode layer or electrical boundary layer is one of the charge generators in the global atmospheric electric circuit. In spite of this we find very few model studies and few measurements of it in the literature. Using a new technique it is shown that in this layer, the space charge density varies exponentially in vertical. A new experimental method based on the surface measurements is discussed to determine all the characteristic scales and an average electrical and meteorological state of an electrode layer. The results obtained are in good agreement with the previous studies. So, it is suggested that an exponential space charge density profile will no longer be an assumption in the case of electrode layer studies. The profiles of atmospheric electric field and electrical conductivity are also derived and a new term named as electrode layer constant is introduced.</p>

					<p>The ionâaerosol balance equations are solved to get the profiles of atmospheric electric parameters over the ground surface in an aerosol-rich environment under the conditions of surface radioactivity. Combining the earlier results for low aerosol concentrations and the present results for high aerosol concentrations, a relation is obtained between the average value of atmospheric electric space charge in the lowest $\sim 2m$, the surface electric field and eddy diffusivity/aerosol concentration. The values of eddy diffusivity estimated from this method using some earlier measurements of space charge and surface electric field are in reasonably good agreement with those calculated from other standard methods using meteorological or electrical variables.</p>

				<title>Retrieval of hydrometeors from microwave radiances with a polarized radiative transfer model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0115</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the results of a Bayesian-based algorithm for the retrieval of hydrometeors from microwave satellite radiances. The retrieval technique proposed makes use of an indigenously developed polarized radiative transfer (RT) model that drives a data driven optimization engine (Bayesian) to perform retrievals of rain and other hydrometeors in a multi-layer, plane parallel raining atmosphere. For the sake of completeness and for the purposes of comparison, retrievals with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have also been done. Retrievals have been done first with a simplified two-layer atmosphere, where assumed values of hydrometeors are given to the forward model and these are taken as âmeasured radiancesâ. The efficacy of the two retrieval strategies is then tested for this case in order to establish accuracy and speed. The highlight of the work is however, the case study wherein a tropical storm in the Bay of Bengal is taken up, to critically examine the performance of the retrieval algorithm for an extreme event wherein a 14-layer realistic, raining atmosphere has been considered and retrievals are done against Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) measured radiances. The key novelties of the work are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>inclusion of polarization from both hydrometeors and oceans in the RT model, and</li>
						<li>populating the database involving atmospheric profiles \textit {vs}. simulated radiances by profiles of similar rain events in the past.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In this work, the database was populated with TRMM retrieved profiles for tropical cyclones that occurred earlier in the area of interest (Indian Ocean), rather than with the Goddard Cloud Ensemble profiles. The use of (i) polarization in the forward model and (ii) creation of an a \textit {priori} database for the retrieval denote the significant departure from the current state-of-the-art in the area.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0117-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chhoti Gandak is a meandering river which originates in the terai area of the Ganga Plain and serves as a lifeline for the people of Deoria district, Uttar Pradesh. It travels a distance of about 250 km and drains into Ghaghara near Gothani, Siwan district of Bihar. It has been observed that people of this region suffer from water-borne health problems; therefore water samples were collected to analyse its quality along the entire length of Chhoti Gandak River.</p>
					<p>The principal components of water quality are controlled by lithology, gentle slope gradient, poor drainage, long residence of water, ion exchange, weathering of minerals, heavy use of fertilizers, and domestic wastes. At some stations water is hard with an excess alkalinity and is not suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes. The variation in the local and regional hydrogeochemical processes distinguished the geogenic sources from the anthropogenic one.</p>

				<title>Distribution of arsenic and mercury in subtropical coastal beachrock, Gulf of Mannar, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0129-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An assessment of coastal pollution was made on the basis of trace element concentrations (arsenic âAs, mercury â Hg) in the Gulf of Mannar. The beachrock samples were collected along the coastal tracts between Rameswaram and Kanyakumari. The samples were dried and digested to determine the As and Hg using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS-air-acetylene and nitrous oxide method). The As and Hg accumulation status of the beachrock was assessed using geo-accumulation index values (\textit {I_geo}). The accumulation of As and Hg in the beachrock ranges from 2.75 to 20.72 $\mu g g^{â1}$ and from 0.06 to 0.31 $\mu g g^{â1}$, respectively. The As and Hg concentrations in the beachrocks are compared with crustal average values and average of other region sediments. The possible source of the contamination is from atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic activities.</p>

					<p>We determine the degree of variation of model ï¬tness,to a true model based on amplitude variation with angle (AVA)methodology for a synthetic gas hydrate model,using co-operative fuzzy c-means clustering,constrained to a rock physics model.When a homogeneous starting model is used,with only traditional least squares optimization scheme for inversion,the variance of the parameters is found to be comparatively high.In this co-operative methodology,the output from the least squares inversion is fed as an input to the fuzzy scheme.Tests with co-operative inversion using fuzzy c-means with damped least squares technique and constraints derived from empirical relationship based on rock properties model show improved stability,model ï¬tness and variance for all the three parameters in comparison with the standard inversion alone.</p>

				<title>The Suruli shear zone and regional scale folding pattern in Madurai block of Southern Granulite Terrain, south India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0147-0160</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Through the application of remote sensing techniques followed by field checks, the exact extension  and nature of Suruli shear zone in Madurai block of southern granulite terrain (SGT) in south India is brought out for the first time in this work. The dominant rock type exposed in this area is charnockite intruded by granites. The Suruli ductile shear zone extends from just west of Kadaiyanallur in the south to Ganguvarpatti in the north over a length of 150 km. Between Kadaiyanallur and Kambam, the shear zone extends roughly in NâS direction. From Kambam, it swerves towards NE and then towards ENE near Ganguvarpatti. The strongly developed transposed foliation and mylonite foliation within the shear zone dip towards east only and so the eastern block (Varushanad hills) is the hanging wall and the western block (Cardamom hills) is the footwall of the shear zone. In the eastern block, three distinct phases of regional scale folding (F1, F2 and F3) are recognized. In complete contrast, the western block recorded only the last phase (F3) regional scale folding. As the more deformed eastern block (older terrain) moved over the relatively less deformed western block (younger terrain) along the Suruli shear zone, it is proposed that this shear zone is a thrust or reverse fault, probably of Proterozoic age. As there are evidences for decreasing displacement from north to south (i.e., from Ganguvarpatti to Kadaiyanallur), the Suruli shear zone could be a rotational thrust or reverse fault with the pivot located close to Kadaiyanallur. As the pivot is located near Achankovil shear zone which trends WNW-ESE (dip towards SSW), the Suruli shear zone could be splaying (branching) out from Achankovil shear zone. In a nutshell, the Suruli shear zone could be a splay, rotational thrust or reverse fault.</p>

				<title>Strain analysis and stratigraphic status of Nongkhya, Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates of Shillong basin, Meghalaya, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0161-0174</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Shillong basin, one of the Purana basins of the Indian peninsula is situated in the central and eastern parts of the Shillong plateau of NE India. Metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the basin are of Mesoproterozoic age and lithostratigraphically belong to Shillong Group (erstwhile Shillong series) comprising Lower Metapelitic Formation (LMF) and Upper Quartzitic Formation (UQF). A long, persistent, faulted and tectonically attenuated conglomerate known as NongkhyaâSumerâ Mawmaram-conglomerate separates these two formations. In the present work, quantitative strain analyses of the pebbles of Sumer, Nongkhya and Mawmaram conglomerates of Ri-Bhoi and West Khasi Hills districts of Meghalaya are carried out using manual and computerized programmes. Eight different techniques for intrapebble, interpebble and bulk rock strain estimation are applied and results are compared systematically. Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates bear the testimony of broadly flattening type of deformation (0 &mt; \textit {k} &mt; 1) while Nongkhya conglomerate shows constriction type (1 &mt; \textit {k} &mt; $\alpha $). The change in strain ellipsoid shape from Nongkhya to Mawmaram area is accompanied by a change of fabric from \textit {S} &mt; \textit {L} to \textit {L} &mt; \textit {S} tectonites. Affinity of rotational strain is more in Nongkhya conglomerate as compared to Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates. The compactness of pebbles is high in case of Nongkhya conglomerate and low to moderate in Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates indicating high strain in Nongkhya conglomerate (northeastern part of Shillong basin) relative to Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates (southwestern part of Shillong basin). Thus strain magnitude increases from SW to NE direction of the Shillong basin.</p>
					<p>The tectonostratigraphic status of these conglomerates suggest that the Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates were initially a part of one conglomerate horizon of interformation type between LMF and UQF of the Shillong Group. With progressive deformation, the northeastern part of the Sumer conglomerate suffered tectonic attenuation and separation and eventually thrusted over the Basement Gneissic Group (BGG) as a tectonic m$\acute{e} $lange. This sector of the conglomerate is known as Nongkhya conglomerate. The tectonic configuration of the Nongkhya conglomerate is the  effect of right and left lateral strike slip movement of Sumer conglomerate at Sumer and Adabasti points, respectively. This is a positive signature of post \textit {D}_{3} deformation on the Sumer conglomerate. The regional sigmoidal pattern of the interformational conglomerate broadly correlate with the Tyrsad-Barapani Shear Zone (TBSZ) of sinistral nature.</p>

				<title>Contrasting magmatic signatures in the Rairakhol and Koraput alkaline complexes, Eastern Ghats belt, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0175-0181</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relation between alkaline magmatism and tectonism has been a contentious issue, particularly for the Precambrian continental regions. Alkaline complexes at the southwestern margin of Eastern Ghats belt, India, have been interpreted as rift-valley magmatism. However, those complexes occurring in granulite ensemble in the interior segments of the Eastern Ghats belt could not possibly be related to the rift-system, assumed for the western margin of the Eastern Ghats belt. Koraput complex was emplaced in a pull-apart structure, dominated by magmatic fabrics and geochemically similar to a fractionated alkaline complex, compatible with an alkalibasalt series. Rairakhol complex, on the other hand, shows dominantly solid-state deformation fabrics and geochemically similar to a fractionated calc-alkaline suite. Isotopic data for the Koraput complex indicate ca. 917 Ma alkaline magmatism from a depleted mantle source and postcrystalline thermal overprint at ca. 745 Ma, also recorded from sheared metapelitic country rocks. The calc-alkaline magmatism of the Rairakhol complex occurred around 938 Ma, from an enriched mantle source, closely following Grenvillian granulite facies imprint in the charnockitic country rocks.</p>

				<title>Doppler weather Radar based Nowcasting of cyclone Ogni</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0183-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we describe offline analysis of Indian Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) data from cyclone Ogni using a suite of radar algorithms as implemented on NEXRAD and the advanced algorithms developed jointly by the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) and the University of Oklahoma. We demonstrate the applicability of the various algorithms to Indian radar data, the improvement in the quality control and evaluate the benefit of nowcasting capabilities in Indian conditions. New information about the tropical cyclone structure, as derived from application of the algorithms is also discussed in this study.</p>
					<p>Finally, we suggest improvements that could be made to the Indian data collection strategies, networking and real-time analysis. Since this is the first study of its kind to process and utilize DWR data in a tropical climate, the suggestions on real-time analysis and data collection strategies made in this paper, would in many cases, be beneficial to other countries embarking on DWR network modernization programs.</p>

				<title>A climatological study of the relations among solar activity, galactic cosmic ray and precipitation on various regions over the globe</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0201-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We apply Fourier and wavelet analyses to the precipitation and sunspot numbers in the time series (1901â2000) over Australia ($27^\circ S, 133^\circ E$), Canada ($60^\circ N, 95^\circ W$), Ethiopia ($8^\circ N, 38^\circ E$), Greenland ($72^\circ N, 40^\circ W$), United Kingdom ($54^\circ N, 2^\circ W$), India ($20^\circ N, 77^\circ E$), Iceland ($65^\circ N, 18^\circ W$), Japan ($36^\circ N, 138^\circ E$), United States ($38^\circ N, 97^\circ W$), South Africa ($29^\circ S, 24^\circ E$) and Russia ($60^\circ N, 100^\circ E$). Correlation analyses were also performed to find any relation among precipitation, sunspot numbers, temperature, and cloud-cover at the same spatial and temporal scale. Further correlations were also performed between precipitation with electron and proton fluence at the time interval, 1987â2006. All these parameters were considered in annual and seasonal scales. Though correlation study between precipitation and other parameters do not hint any linear relation, still the Fourier and wavelet analyses give an idea of common periodicities. The 9â11 year periodicity of sunspot numbers calculated by Fourier transform is also confirmed by wavelet transform in annual scale. Similarly, wavelet analysis for precipitation also supports the short periods at 2â5 years which is verified by Fourier transform in discontinuous time over different geographic regions.</p>

				<title>Characteristic of plasma bubbles observed by DMSP in the topside ionosphere during the year 2005</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0211-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To study the characteristic of plasma bubbles in the topside ionosphere during the solar minima, we have analyzed a large database of post-sunset plasma density measurement acquired during $\sim 5104$ equatorial crossings made by Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F14 in 2005. On 675 of these crossings, equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) events were observed as intervals of depleted and irregular plasma densities that degrade communication and navigation signals. We have analyzed these EPB events to study their distributions with month, season and longitude. To test for possible dependence of EPB occurrence at topside altitudes on the level of magnetic activity, we compared the distributions of one year database with those of Kp index at the time of equatorial crossings by the DMSP satellites. We also examined the response of the evening sector, low-latitude ionosphere during eight magnetic storms with minimum Dst $\leq â100nT$. We observed that EPBs occurred regularly during geomagnetic storms, especially in the initial and main phases but can be suppressed sometimes for days, after prolonged activity during  recovery phases. These results are discussed according to the other reported results.</p>

				<title>First results of fair-weather atmospheric electricity measurements in Northeast India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0221-0228</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the month of March 2006, a short campaign was conducted to measure fair-weather atmospheric electricity parameters in Tripura, Northeast India ($23.50^\circ N, 91.25^\circ E$). The campaign was the first of its kind in this region of the globe. The main objective of the campaign was to characterize the diurnal variation of three parameters namely vertical potential gradient (\textit {E}), vertical airâearth current density (\textit {Jz}) and atmospheric electrical conductivity ($\sigma $) in fair-weather conditions. The diurnal variation of \textit {E} and \textit {Jz} over sixteen fair-weather days shows two distinct maxima around 14UT and 20UT and a minimum around 03UT. The average vertical potential gradient is found to be $108VÂ·m^{â1}$ and airâearth current density 1.85 pAÂ·$m^{â2}$. The average bipolar atmospheric electrical conductivity at the ground level is found to be 19.6 fSÂ·$m^{â1}$. An excellent positive correlation between \textit {E} and \textit {Jz} is found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96. A comparative study with Carnegie universal variation shows 70% correlation with observed variation of vertical potential gradient during the period of the campaign. The results are discussed in view of difficulty as well as possibility of getting global signatures in atmospheric electricity measurements made from tropical land stations.</p>

				<title>Active and break spells of the Indian summer monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0229-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we suggest criteria for the identification of active and break events of the Indian summer monsoon on the basis of recently derived high resolution daily gridded rainfall dataset  over India (1951â2007). Active and break events are defined as periods during the peak monsoon months of July and August, in which the normalized anomaly of the rainfall over a critical area, called the monsoon core zone exceeds 1 or is less than â1.0 respectively, provided the criterion is satisfied for at least three consecutive days. We elucidate the major features of these events. We consider very briefly the relationship of the intraseasonal fluctuations between these events and the interannual variation of the summer monsoon rainfall.</p>
					<p>We find that breaks tend to have a longer life-span than active spells. While, almost 80% of the active spells lasted 3â4 days, only 40% of the break spells were of such short duration. A small fraction (9%) of active spells and 32% of break spells lasted for a week or longer. While active events occurred almost every year, not a single break occurred in 26% of the years considered. On an average, there are 7 days of active and break events from July through August. There are no significant trends in either the days of active or break events. We have shown that there is a major difference between weak spells and long intense breaks. While weak spells are characterized by weak moist convective regimes, long intense break events have a heat trough type circulation which is similar to the circulation over the Indian subcontinent before the onset of the monsoon.</p>
					<p>The space-time evolution of the rainfall composite patterns suggests that the revival from breaks occurs primarily from northward propagations of the convective cloud zone. There are important differences between the spatial patterns of the active/break spells and those characteristic of interannual variation, particularly those associated with the link to ENSO. Hence, the interannual variation of the Indian monsoon cannot be considered as primarily arising from the interannual variation of intraseasonal variation. However, the signature over the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean on intraseasonal time scales is similar to that on the interannual time scales.</p>

				<title>Total column density variations of ozone ($O_3$) in presence of different types of clouds</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0249-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The zenith sky scattered light spectra were carried out using zenith sky UV-visible spectrometer in clear and cloudy sky conditions during MayâNovember 2000 over the tropical station Pune ($18^\circ 32^\prime N, 73^\circ 51^\prime E$). These scattered spectra are obtained in the spectral range 462â498 nm between $75^\circ $ and $92^\circ $ solar zenith angles (SZAs). The slant column densities (SCDs) as well as total column densities (TCDs) of $NO_{2}, O_{3}, H_{2}O$ and $O_4$ are derived with different SZAs in clear and cloudy sky conditions. The large enhancements and reductions in TCDs of the above gases are observed in thick cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds and thin high cirrus (Ci) clouds, respectively, compared to clear sky conditions. The enhancements in TCDs of $O_3$ appear to be due to photon diffusion, multiple Mie-scattering and multiple reflections between layered clouds or isolated patches of optically thick clouds. The reductions in TCDs due to optically thin clouds are noticed during the above period. The variations in TCDs of $O_3$ measured under cloudy sky are discussed with total cloud cover (octas) of different types of clouds such as low clouds (\textit {C_L}), medium clouds (\textit {C_M}) and high clouds (\textit {C_H}) during MayâNovember 2000. The variations in TCDs of $O_3$ measured in cloudy sky conditions are found to be well matched with cloud sensitive parameter colour index (CI) and found to be in good correlation. The $TCD_{cloudy}$ are derived using airmass factors (AMFs) computed without considering cloud cover and CI in radiative transfer (RT) model, whereas $TCD_{model}$ are derived using AMFs computed with considering cloud cover, cloud height and CI in RT model. The $TCD_{model}$ is the column density of illuminated cloudy effect. A good agreement is observed between $TCD_{model}$, $TCD_{Dob}$ and $TCD_{GOME}$.</p>

				<title>Assessing climate change impacts on water balance in the Mount Makiling forest, Philippines</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0265-0283</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A statistical downscaling known for producing station-scale climate information from GCM output was preferred to evaluate the impacts of climate change within the \textit {Mount Makiling} forest watershed, Philippines. The lumped hydrologic BROOK90 model was utilized for the water balance assessment of climate change impacts based on two scenarios (A1B and A2) from CGCM3 experiment. The annual precipitation change was estimated to be 0.1â9.3% increase for A1B scenario, and â3.3 to 3.3% decrease/increase for the A2 scenario. Difference in the mean temperature between the present and the 2080s were predicted to be $0.6â2.2^\circ C$ and $0.6â3.0^\circ C$ under A1B and A2 scenarios, respectively. The water balance showed that 42% of precipitation is converted into evaporation, 48% into streamflow, and 10% into deep seepage loss. The impacts of climate change on water balance reflected dramatic fluctuations in hydrologic events leading to high evaporation losses, and decrease in streamflow, while groundwater flow appeared unaffected. A study on the changes in monthly water balance provided insights into the hydrologic changes within the forest watershed system which can be used in mitigating the effects of climate change.</p>

				<title>Shift in detrital sedimentation in the eastern Bay of Bengal during the late Quaternary</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0285-0295</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Down-core variations of granulometric, geochemical and mineral magnetism of a 70-cm long sediment core retrieved from the eastern Bay of Bengal abyssal region were studied to understand sedimentation pattern and sediment provenance during the last $\sim 12$ kyr BP. Based on down-core physical and elemental variations, three units were identified: unit 3 (70â43 cm) is a $\sim 30$ cm thick clayey silt organic carbon-rich (0.5â0.92%) turbidite probably delivered by the Brahmaputra River during the late Quaternary period. Units 2 (43â24 cm) and 1 (24â0 cm) represent enhanced and  reduced supply of coarse-grained detrital sediments from the Ganges River during early and late Holocene period, respectively. Increased terrigenous supply dilutes calcium carbonate ($CaCO_3$) and biogenic elements (P, Ba and Cu) in units 3 and 2. On the contrary, a reduction in detrital input enhances $CaCO_3$ and biogenic elements in unit 1. Lithogenic elements (Ti, Al, K and Rb) and shale-normalized REE patterns in all three units suggest terrigenous source. The shift in provenance from the Brahmaputra to the Ganges derived sediments is evident by a sharp increase in sediment grain size, increased concentration and grain size assemblages of magnetic minerals, lithogenic elements concentration and $La_{n}/Yb_{n}$ ratio. This study highlights terrigenous dilution on biogenic sedimentation in the eastern Bay of Bengal sediments.</p>

				<title>Granularity and textural analysis as a proxy for extreme wave events in southeast coast of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0297-0305</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extreme wave events of 1000 and 1500 years (radiocarbon ages) have been recently reported in Mahabalipuram region, southeast coast of India. Subsequently, we carried out extensive sedimentological analysis in regions covering a total lateral coverage of 12 km with a new archeological site as the central portion of the study area. Twelve trenches in shore normal profiles exhibit landward thinning sequences as well as upward fining sequences confirming with the global signatures of extreme wave events. The sediment size ranges from fine-to-medium and moderately well sorted-to-well sorted, and exhibit positive skewness with platykurtic-to-leptokurtic nature. We now propose the abrupt winnowing or back and forth motion including unidirectional transport of these deposited sediments, which results in positive skewness. Textural analyses derived from scanning electron microscope studies (SEM) demonstrate the alteration produced, in the ilmenite mineral with vivid presence of pits and crescents with deformation observed on the surface due to extreme wave activities. This is further confirmed with the predominance of high-density mineral such as magnetite (5.2) and other heavy minerals in these deposits inferred the high-intensity of the reworking process of the beach shelf sediments.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0307-0341</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Systematic description of 25 gastropod species from the Khari Nadi Formation (Aquitanian) and Chhasra Formation (Burdigalian) from the Kachchh District, Gujarat, India is given. A checklist of 116 forms including those reported by earlier researchers, emending taxonomic identifications wherever necessary, is also provided. Vredenburg had referred these two formations together as âthe Gaj Beds of Kachchhâ. He noticed the affinity of molluscs among the Miocene deposits of Kachchh and Kathiawar regions of Gujarat, and Sind province of Pakistan. He also observed that molluscs from his âLower Gajâ and âUpper Gajâ Formations showed relationship respectively with the Rembang (Aquitanian) and Njalindung (Burdigalian) series of the East Indies. Aquitanian and Burdigalian ages assigned by him were later substantiated by Raju on the basis of foraminifera. Present studies corroborated that the molluscan assemblage from the Miocene rocks of Kachchh is closely related to that from the Gaj Beds of Sind and the Ashapura Clay Member of Kathiawar; besides revealing that the fauna from these three formations taken together is essentially endemic. Discovery of certain species from the Quilon Beds in the Miocene of Kachchh evinces a close affinity between these two formations. The present fauna includes five extant forms, while 29 forms have related species in the Recent fauna.</p>

				<title>Compositional variations of chromiferous spinel in Mg-rich rocks of the Deccan Traps, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0343-0363</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Composition of chromiferous spinel included in olivines of Mg-rich basalts and gabbros of the Deccan Traps (Gujarat and Western Ghats) are reported here. They vary from Al-rich compositions [$Al_{2}O_{3} = 53wt.%$; Cr#, 100Cr/(Cr + Al) = 12] to Cr-rich compositions [$Cr_{2}O_{3} = 51wt.%$; Cr# = 84], and from Cr-Al rich compositions towards Cr-rich Ti-magnetite ($TiO_{2}$ up to 23 wt.%, ulv$\ddot{o} $spinel up to 67mol.%). The Mg# [100Mg/($Mg + Fe^{2+}$)] of spinel decreases from 81 to nearly zero. The highest Cr# has been found in the Bushe Fm., Thakurvadi Fm., and some high-Ti basalts of the Pavagadh section, whereas some of the low-Ti basalts of Saurashtra have Al-rich compositions typical of spinels found in mid-ocean ridge basalts. The chemical composition of the Deccan Trap spinels is completely different compared to that observed in mantle spinel suites, with very few exceptions. The decreasing Al and increasing Fe and Ti of spinel seems to be mainly the result of decrease of Mg in the locally coexisting melts and favourable cationic substitutions in the lattice. There is barely any evidence of general relationships between the composition of the Deccan spinels and inferred mantle sources of the host magmas. Pyroxene inclusions in spinels may witness a high-pressure stage of crystallization, but the possibility of non-equilibrium crystallization, or even  magma mixing, cannot be ruled out. Overall, the compositional ranges of chromiferous spinel in the Deccan Traps closely match those observed in the other Large Igneous Provinces having mafic/ultramafic intrusions and mafic magma compositions (e.g., Siberian Traps,  Karoo, Emeishan).</p>

				<title>Complete preservation of ophiolite suite from south Andaman, India: A mineralchemical perspective</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0365-0381</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Field studies supplemented by petrographic analyses clearly reveal complete preservation of ophiolite suite from Port Blair ($11^\circ 39^\prime N: 92^\circ 45^\prime E$) to Chiriyatapu ($11^\circ 30^\prime 24^\prime ^\prime N: 92^\circ 42^\prime 30^\prime ^\prime E$) stretch of South Andaman. The ophiolite suite reveals serpentinite at the base which is overlain unconformably by cumulate ultramaficâmafic members with discernible cumulus texture and igneous layering. Basaltic dykes are found to cut across the cumulate ultramaficâmafic members. The succession is capped by well exposed pillow basalts interlayered with arkosic sediments. Olivine from the basal serpentinite unit are highly magnesian ($Fo_{80.1â86.2}$). All clinopyroxene analyses from cumulate pyroxenite, cumulate gabbro and basaltic dyke are discriminated to be âQuadâ and are uniformly restricted to the diopside field. Composition of plagioclase in different lithomembers is systematically varying from calcic to sodic endmembers progressively from cumulate pyroxenite to pillow basalt through cumulate gabbro and basaltic dyke. Plagioclase phenocrysts from basaltic dyke are found to be distinctly zoned ($An_{60.7}âAn_{35.3}$) whereas groundmass plagioclase are relatively sodic ($An_{33}âAn_{23.5}$). Deduced thermobarometric data from different lithomembers clearly correspond to the observed preservation of complete ophiolite suite.</p>

				<title>Source parameters estimation of 2003 Bam earthquake Mw 6.5 using empirical Greenâs function method, based on an evolutionary approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0383-0396</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We determine the source parameters for 2003 (Mw 6.5) Bam, Iran, earthquake using an empirical Greenâs function summation approach to model ground motions recorded by two strong motion stations at approximately 45 km epicentral distance. We introduce a genetic algorithm technique to optimize the fit to observed elastic response spectra. The proposed genetic algorithm technique allows us to explore the sensitivity of the results to multiple source parameters, including hypocenter location, focal mechanism (Strike and Dip), P-wave velocity in depth, fault dimension and rupture and healing velocities.</p>
					<p>We simulated the three components of seismogram at a far station, Mohammad-Abad station, by means of an inversion solution technique and predicted seismograms at another far station, Abaragh, incorporating the estimated model parameters. More agreement of our synthesized seismograms with those of the observed data in comparison with the results of other investigators confirms the reliability of estimated seismological parameters and the applicability of our technique.</p>
					<p>A series of sensitivity analysis are performed for demonstrating the influence of individual model parameter variation on defined error value. Using the empirical Greenâs function summation method, our inferred source parameters provide the basis for predicting main shock shaking and guiding retrofitting efforts at sites, for example, the historical buildings in Arge- Bam site which were damaged during the 2003 Bam earthquake and strong motion data is unavailable.</p>

				<title>Towards understanding the unusual Indian monsoon in 2009</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0397-0415</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian summer monsoon season of 2009 commenced with a massive deficit in all-India rainfallof 48% of the average rainfall in June. The all-India rainfall in July was close to the normal but that in August was deficit by 27%. In this paper, we first focus on June 2009, elucidating the special features and attempting to identify the factors that could have led to the large deficit in rainfall. In June 2009, the phase of the two important modes, viz., El NiËno and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO) was unfavourable. Also, the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (EEIO) was warmer than in other years and much warmer than the Bay. In almost all the years, the opposite is true, i.e., the Bay is warmer than EEIO in June. It appears that this SST gradient gave an edge to the tropical convergence zone over the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean, in competition with the organized convection over the Bay. Thus, convection was not sustained for more than three or four days over the Bay and no northward propagations occurred. We suggest that the reversal of the sea surface temperature (SST) gradient between the Bay of Bengal and EEIO, played a critical role in the rainfall deficit over the Bay and hence the Indian region. We also suggest that suppression of convection over EEIO in association with the El NiËno led to a positive phase of EQUINOO in July and hence revival of the monsoon despite the El NiËno. It appears that the transition to a negative phase of EQUINOO in August and the associated large deficit in monsoon rainfall can also be attributed to the El NiËno.</p>

				<title>Mesoscale model forecast verification during monsoon 2008</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0417-0446</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There have been very few mesoscale modelling studies of the Indian monsoon, with focus on the verification and intercomparison of the operational real time forecasts. With the exception of Das \textit {et al} (2008), most of the studies in the literature are either the case studies of tropical cyclones and thunderstorms or the sensitivity studies involving physical parameterization or climate simulation studies. Almost all the studies are based on either National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), USA, final analysis fields (NCEP FNL) or the reanalysis data used as initial and lateral boundary conditions for driving the mesoscale model.</p>
					<p>Here we present a mesoscale model forecast verification and intercomparison study over India involving three mesoscale models: (i) the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), USA, (ii) the MM5 model developed by NCAR, and (iii) the Eta model of the NCEP, USA. The analysis is carried out for the monsoon season, June to September 2008. This study is unique since it is based entirely on the real time global model forecasts of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) T254 global analysis and forecast system. Based on the evaluation and intercomparison of the mesoscale model forecasts, we recommend the best model for operational real-time forecasts over the Indian region.</p>
					<p>Although the forecast mean 850 hPa circulation shows realistic monsoon flow and the monsoon trough, the systematic errors over the Arabian Sea indicate an easterly bias to the north (of mean flow) and westerly bias to the south (of mean flow). This suggests that the forecasts feature a southward shift in the monsoon current. The systematic error in the 850 hPa temperature indicates that largely the WRF model forecasts feature warm bias and the MM5 model forecasts feature cold bias. Features common to all the three models include warm bias over northwest India and cold bias over southeast peninsula. The 850 hPa specific humidity forecast errors clearly show that the Eta model features dry bias mostly over the sea, while MM5 features moist bias over large part of domain. The RMSE computed at different levels clearly establish that WRF model forecasts feature least errors in the predicted free atmospheric fields. Detailed rainfall forecast verification further establishes that the WRF model forecast rainfall skill remains more or less same in day-2 and day-3 as in day-1, while the forecast skill in the MM5 and Eta models, deteriorates in day-2 and day-3 forecasts.</p>

				<title>Assessing impact of climate change on season length in Karnataka for IPCC SRES scenarios</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0447-0460</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Changes in seasons and season length are an indicator, as well as an effect, of climate change. Seasonal change profoundly affects the balance of life in ecosystems and impacts essential human activities such as agriculture and irrigation. This study investigates the uncertainty of season length in Karnataka state, India, due to the choice of scenarios, season type and number of seasons. Based on the type of season, the monthly sequences of variables (predictors) were selected from datasets of NCEP and Canadian General Circulation Model (CGCM3). Seasonal stratifications were carried out on the selected predictors using K-means clustering technique. The results of cluster analysis revealed increase in average, wet season length in A2, A1B and B1 scenarios towards the end of 21st century. The increase in season length was higher for A2 scenario whereas it was the least for B1 scenario. COMMIT scenario did not show any change in season length. However, no change in average warm and cold season length was observed across the four scenarios considered. The number of seasons was increased from 2 to 5. The results of the analysis revealed that no distinct cluster could be obtained when the number of seasons was increased beyond three.</p>

				<title>Comparative study of MLT mean winds using MF radars located at $16.8^\circ N$ and $8.7^\circ N$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0461-0470</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main aim of the paper is to describe mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) wind field observed between June 2000 and May 2002 by medium frequency (MF) radars at two locations near the equatorial region and at tropical latitude. We have presented and compared observations of mean horizontal winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region over Kolhapur ($16.8^\circ N, 74.2^\circ E$) and Tirunelveli ($8.7^\circ N, 77.8^\circ E$). Our analysis reveals annual oscillation in the zonal wind and semi-annual oscillation in the meridional wind over Kolhapur. On the other hand, results over Tirunelveli reveal semi-annual oscillation (SAO) in the zonal wind and annual oscillation in the meridional wind. Also we have observed enhanced magnitude of wind speed in spring equinox period of 2002 exhibiting the signatures of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) over Tirunelveli.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric aerosol formation and its growth during the cold season in India</title>

				<page>0471-0477</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of molecular diffusivity of $H_{2}SO_{4}$ and $NH_3$ vapours on nucleated particles of $SO^{2â}_{4}$ and $NO^{â}_{3}$ species are reported. Condensation sink and source rate of $H_{2}SO_{4}$ and $NH_3$ vapours, growth rates and ratios of real to apparent nucleation rates are calculated for $SO^{2â}_{4}$ and $NO^{â}_{3}$ aerosols using fractional contributions of them in total aerosol size-distribution during the measurement period at Pune, reported in Chate and Pranesha (2004). The percentage of nucleated $SO^{2â}_{4}$ and $NO^{â}_{3}$ aerosols of mid-point diameter 13 nm are 2% and 3% respectively of the total particles ($13 nm \leq D_{p} \leq 750 nm$) for both $H_{2}SO_{4}$ and $NH_3$ diffusion. In the diameter range $75 nm \leq D_{p} \leq 133 nm$, it is 48% and 45% of $SO^{2â}_{4}$ and $NO^{â}_{3}$ aerosols, respectively for $NH_3$ diffusion and 43% and 36% of $SO^{2â}_{4}$ and $NO^{â}_{3}$ for $H_{2}SO_{4}$ diffusion. Increase in percentage of nucleated particles of these species corresponding to mid-point diameter 133 nm around 0900 h IST is significantly higher than that of mid-point diameter 13 nm and it is due to photo-chemical nucleation, coagulation and coalescence among nucleated clusters. The ratios of real to apparent formation rates for $SO^{2â}_{4}$ and $NO^{â}_{3}$ aerosols are 12% and 11% respectively, corresponding to mid-point diameter 13 nm, 17% and 13%, for midpoint diameter 133 nm and 12% and 9.5%, for mid-point diameter 750 nm. The results indicate that nucleation involving $H_{2}SO_{4}$ and acidic $NH_3$ diffusion on $SO^{2â}_{4}$ and $NO^{â}_{3}$ particles is the most relevant mechanism in this region.</p>

				<title>Changes in concentration and size distribution of aerosols during fog over the south Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0479-0487</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements of the concentration and size distribution of aerosol particles in the size-ranges of 0.5â20 $\mu m$ and 16â700 nm diameters were made during six fog episodes over the south Indian Ocean. Observations show that concentrations of particles of all sizes start decreasing 1â2 hours before the occurrence of fog. This decrease is more prominent for coarse particles of &lt; 1 $\mu m$ diameter and continues until 10â20 minutes before the onset of fog when  particle concentrations in all size ranges rapidly increase by one/two orders of magnitude in $\sim 20$ minutes. Thereafter, concentrations of particles of all sizes gradually decrease until the dissipation of fog. After the fog dissipation, concentrations of coarse mode particles rapidly increase and restore to their pre-fog levels but concentrations of the Aitken mode particles decrease slowly and reach their pre-fog levels only after 1â2 hours. The net effect of fog is to change the bimodal size distributions of aerosols with a coarse mode at 1.0 $\mu m$ and an accumulation mode at 40â60 nm to a power law size distribution. It is proposed that the preferential growth and sedimentation of the coarse mode hygroscopic particles in the initial phase cause a large decrease in the aerosol surface area. As a result, the low vapour pressure gases which were initially being used for the growth of coarse mode particles, now accelerate the growth  rates of the accumulation and Aitken mode particles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>For the limitation of the conventional multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART), a constrained MART (CMART) is proposed in this paper. In the new tomographic algorithm, a popular two-dimensional multi-point finite difference approximation of the second order Laplacian operator is used to smooth the electron density field. The feasibility and superiority of the new method are demonstrated by using the numerical simulation experiment. Finally, the CMART is used to reconstruct the regional electron density field by using the actual GNSS data under geomagnetic quiet and disturbed days. The available ionosonde data from Beijing station further validates the superiority of the new method.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the morphology of the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) along $45^\circ W$ longitude in east Brazil, where the ground magnetic (dip) equator is associated with the largest declination in the world. Daily range of the horizontal field ($\Delta $ \textit {H}), as expected, was largest at the station in the chain closest to the dip equator, Sao Luiz (inclination $â0.25^\circ S$). $\Delta $ \textit {Z} was largest positive at Eusebio (inclination $9.34^\circ S$) and largest negative at Belem (inclination $7.06^\circ N$); both near the fringe of EEJ belt. $\Delta $ \textit {Z} at Sao Luiz during the daytime was unexpectedly large negative in-spite of a small dip and also located south of the dip equator where $\Delta $ \textit {Z} should be positive. Center of EEJ was found to be shifted southward of the dip equator by about $1^\circ $ in latitude. During southern summer, $\Delta $ \textit {Y} started decreasing from 00 h and reached a minimum value in the afternoon, an abnormal feature not discussed for any station so far. The mid-day value of the direction of $\Delta $ \textit {H} vector was $22^\circ -- 24^\circ W$ compared to the declination of $19^\circ â21^\circ W$ in the region.</p>

				<title>Variability of soil moisture and its relationship with surface albedo and soil thermal diffusivity at Astronomical Observatory, Thiruvananthapuram, south Kerala</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0507-0517</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Continuous observation data collected over the year 2008 at Astronomical Observatory, Thiruvananthapuram in south Kerala ($76^\circ 59^\prime E$ longitude and $8^\circ 30^\prime N$ latitude) are used to study the diurnal, monthly and seasonal soil moisture variations. The effect of rainfall on diurnal and seasonal soil moisture is discussed. We have investigated relationships of soil moisture with surface albedo and soil thermal diffusivity. The diurnal variation of surface albedo appears as a U-shaped curve on sunny days. Surface albedo decreases with the increase of solar elevation angle, and it tends to be a constant when solar elevation angle is greater than $40^\circ $. So the daily average surface albedo was calculated using the data when solar elevation angle is greater than $40^\circ $. The results indicate that the mean daily surface albedo decreases with increases in soil moisture content, showing a typical exponential relation between the surface albedo and the soil moisture. Soil thermal diffusivity increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of soil moisture.</p>

				<title>Distribution of dissolved carbohydrates and uronic acids in a tropical estuary, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0519-0530</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbohydrates including uronic acids are among the active components of dissolved organic carbon, and play an important role in biogeochemical cycling of organic carbon in marine environments. In order to understand their distribution, concentrations of total dissolved carbohydrate (TCHO), dissolved polysaccharide (PCHO), dissolved monosaccharide (MCHO), and dissolved uronic acid (URA) were measured in the Mandovi estuary, west coast of India during the monsoon and premonsoon seasons. The estuary experienced nearly fresh water condition during the monsoon season and marine condition during the pre-monsoon season. Concentrations of TCHO, MCHO and URA ranged from 17.7 to 67.3 $\mu $M C, 4.1 to 15.5 $\mu $M C and 2.3 to 10.8 $\mu $M C, and their contribution to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied from $\sim $11 to 60%, 2.5 to 9.7%, and 1.8 to 5.3%, respectively. PCHO accounted for $\sim $52 to 92% of the TCHO. Generally, concentrations and yields of TCHO species were greater during the monsoon season. Phytoplankton abundance and bacterial cell numbers influenced the distribution of TCHO in the pre-monsoon season but not during the monsoon season. Transport of TCHO rich (11 to 60%) dissolved organic matter from the Mandovi estuary to the coastal waters during the monsoon season may affect ecosystem function by fueling biological activity of heterotrophic micro-organisms.</p>

				<title>Correlation of the oldest Toba Tuff to sediments in the central Indian Ocean Basin</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0531-0539</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have identified an ash layer in association with Australasian microtektites of $\sim 0.77Ma$ old in two sediment cores which are $\sim $450 km apart in the central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB). Morphology and chemical composition of glass shards and associated microtektites have been used to trace their provenance. In ODP site 758 from Ninetyeast Ridge, ash layer-D (13 cm thick, 0.73â0.75 Ma) and layer-E (5 cm thick, 0.77â0.78 Ma) were previously correlated to the oldest Toba Tuff (OTT) eruptions of the Toba caldera, Sumatra. In this investigation, we found tephra $\sim $3100 km to the southwest of Toba caldera that is chemically identical to layer D of ODP site 758 and  ash in the South China Sea correlated to the OTT. Layer E is not present in the CIOB or other ocean basins. The occurrence of tephra correlating to layer D suggests a widespread distribution of OTT tephra ($\sim 3.6 \times 10^{7} km^{2}$), an ash volume of at least $\sim 1800 km^{3}$, a total OTT volume of $2300 km^3$, and classification of the OTT eruption as a super-eruption.</p>

				<title>Detrital zircon and apatite fission track data in the Liaoxi basins: Implication to Meso-Cenozoic thermo-tectonic evolution of the northern margin of the North China Craton</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0541-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Detrital zircon and apatite fission track (ZFT and AFT) data of the sandstones collected from the Liaoxi basins served as a significant probe to study the Meso-Cenozoic thermo-tectonic reactivation events in the northern margin of the North China Craton. All sandstones show wide ZFT and AFT age spectrum and most of ZFT and AFT ages are younger than depositional age of respective host rocks, which suggest widespread track resetting of the host rocks in the Liaoxi basins after deposition. This hot geothermal status in the Liaoxi basins deduced from ZFT and AFT data is temporal consistent with the lithospheric evolution of the North China Craton, which implies that the lithosphere under the northern margin of the North China Craton underwent similar thermo-tectonic destruction process as the intracratonic Bohai Sea. The young ZFT peak age, which ranges from $\sim $50Ma to 20 Ma, to some extend, provides a temporal constraint on the time that lithosphere significantly thinned and following reverse of the Liaoxi basins and uplift of the eastern part of the Yan-Liao Orogenic Belt. Exhumation of 1.5â2 km can be estimated in the eastern part of the Yan-Liao Orogenic Belt since $\sim $30Ma to 10 Ma.</p>

				<title>The 2007 Bengkulu earthquake, its rupture model and implications for seismic hazard</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0553-0560</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 12 September 2007 great Bengkulu earthquake (\textit {M_w} 8.4) occurred on the west coast of Sumatra about 130 km SW of Bengkulu. The earthquake was followed by two strong aftershocks of \textit {M_w} 7.9 and 7.0. We estimate coseismic offsets due to the mainshock, derived from near-field Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements from nine continuous SuGAr sites operated by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) group. Using a forward modelling approach, we estimated slip distribution on the causative rupture of the 2007 Bengkulu earthquake and found two patches of large slip, one located north of the mainshock epicenter and the other, under the Pagai Islands. Both patches of large slip on the rupture occurred under the island belt and shallow water. Thus, despite its great magnitude, this earthquake did not generate a major tsunami. Further, we suggest that the occurrence of great earthquakes in the subduction zone on either side of the Siberut Island region, might have led to the increase in static stress in the region, where the last great earthquake occurred in 1797 and where there is evidence of strain accumulation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This study highlights the hydro-climatic features of the ï¬ve wet periods contributing in different percentages to the annual rainfall total over major river basins in India.Spatial and temporal variations in the parameters such as starting date,duration and rainfall intensity of these wet periods throughout India have been discussed using daily gridded rainfall data for the period 1951 â2007.An attempt is also made here,to assess the impact of global SSTs on the start and duration of the wet periods in Indian river basins.</p>
					<p>It is observed that,for almost all river basins in India,the 10%wet period occurs in the months of July/August with an average duration of 1 â3 days and rainfall intensity varying from 44 to 89 mm/day.The duration of the wet period contributing 90%to the annual rainfall varies from 112 days in the central parts of India to 186 days in the northern parts of the country.Signi ï¬cant increase in the rainfall intensity has been observed in the case of some river basins of central India. The late start of 75%wet period along the West Coast and in peninsular river basins has been observed with increase in Nino 3.4 SSTs (MAM),while increase in the duration of the 75%wet period over the Krishna basin is associated with increase in Nino 3.4 SSTs (concurrent JJAS).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Carolina Sandhills are known to have an area of maximum precipitation on its western boundary during the summer mainly due to differences in soil types.Statistical analysis was performed on summer precipitation data from automated weather stations in the Carolinas,along the Sandhills for the years 2001 to 2006.Statistically signiï¬cant difference was observed between the day and night precipitation amounts.A case study also revealed the diurnal pattern of convective precipitation.</p>
					<p>North American Mesoscale (NAM)model forecasts for the summers of 2004 to 2006 were evaluated using observations.The model underpredicted precipitation signiï¬cantly during nights. A numerical simulation using Weather Research and Forecast (WRF)model was performed for August 9 â11,2001 and the forecasts were compared with observed precipitation data.The model precipitation forecasts were better for daytime as compared to the night.This feature is attributed to model physics not capturing cloud âradiation interaction processes dominant during nights. Although this study is for a speciï¬c region in the US,results are applicable for other regions for similar conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Temperature and fresh snow are essential inputs in an avalanche forecasting model.Without these  parameters,prediction of avalanche occurrence for a region would be very difficult.In the complex terrain of Himalaya,nonavailability of snow and meteorological data of the remote locations during snow storms in the winter is a common occurrence.In view of this persistent problem present study estimates maximum temperature,minimum temperature,ambient temperature and precipitation intensity on different regions of Indian western Himalaya by using similar parameters of the neighbouring regions.The location at which parameters are required and its neighbouring locations should all fall in the same snow climatic zone.Initial step to estimate the parameters at a location,is to shift the parameters of neighbouring regions at a reference height corresponding to the altitude of the location at which parameters are to be estimated.The parameters at this reference height are then spatially interpolated by using Barnes objective analysis.The parameters estimated on different locations are compared with the observed one and the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE)of the observed and estimated values of the parameters are discussed for the winters of 2007 â2008.</p>

					<p>In this study,an attempt has been made to bring out the observational aspects of vertical wind shear in thunderstorms over Minicoy.Case studies of thunderstorm events have been examined to ï¬nd out the effect of vertical wind shear and instability on strength and longevity of thunderstorms.Role of vertical wind shear in thunderstorms and its mechanism has been explored in this study.Results reveal that for prolonged thunderstorms high and low instability along with moderate to high vertical wind shear (moderate:$0.003S^{â1} \leq $ vertical wind shear $\leq 0.005S^{â1}$ and high:&lt; $0.005S^{â1}$ )  play a signiï¬cant role in longevity and strength of thunderstorms.The mechanism of vertical wind shear in thunderstorms was investigated in a few cases of thunderstorm events where the duration of thunderstorm was covered by the radiosonde/rawin ascent observation taken at Minicoy. Empirical model has been developed to classify thunderstorm type and to determine the strength and longevity of thunderstorms.Model validation has been carried out for selected cases.Model could classify thunderstorm type for most of the cases of thunderstorm events over island and coastal stations.</p>

				<title>Anomalous electric field changes and high flash rate beneath a thunderstorm in northeast India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0617-0625</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In spite of many experimental and theoretical studies the relationships between storm dynamics, severe weather,and lightning activity have been least understood.Measurements of electric ï¬eld made under a severe thunderstorm at a northeastern Indian station,Guwahati,India are reported. Lightning ï¬ash rate increases drastically to about 84 ï¬ashes per minute (fpm)during the active stage which lasted for about 7 minutes,from about 15 ï¬ashes per minute during the initial phase of thunderstorm.Sudden increase in lightning ï¬ash rate (âlightning jump â)of about 65 fpm/min is also observed in the beginning of the active stage.The dissipating stage is marked by slow and steady decrease in lightning frequency.Despite very high ï¬ash rate during the active stage, no severe weather conditions are observed at the ground.It is proposed that the short duration of the active stage might be the reason for the non-observance of severe weather conditions at the ground.Analysis of Skew-t graph at Guwahati suggests that vertical distribution of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)also may play some role in non-occurrence  of  severe weather at ground in spite of large lightning ï¬ash rate and lightning jump observed in this thunderstorm.Further,all electric ï¬eld changes after a lightning discharge indicates the presence of strong Lower Positive Charge Centers (LPCC)in the active and dissipation stages. This suggests that LPCC plays an important role in initiation of lightning discharges in these stages.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>One dimensional numerical model has been developed to predict the production of space charge and variations in other electrical parameters within the low level stratiform type of cloud having very weak vertical motion.Non-linear coupled differential equations which govern ion concentrations,charged and neutral droplet concentrations and electric ï¬eld were used.Symmetry has been  observed in all the electrical parameters within the cloud.The magnitude of average positive ion concentrations was observed to be high as compared to the negative ion concentrations,which is due to low scavenging rate of positive ions than the negative ions,highly attributed to their mobilities.The rate of scavenging of ions affects the concentration of charged droplets,which eventually inï¬uence the electric ï¬eld and thus the space charge density within the cloud.Maximum electric ï¬eld (\textit {E}_max) was observed at middle of the cloud whereas minimum was observed at both the edges of the cloud.Minimum electric ï¬eld (\textit {E}_min) was found to be equal and constant ($\sim 27 Vm^{â1}$ )for any drop concentration.Net positive and negative space charges were observed at the top and bottom of the cloud,respectively.The simulated results show some discrepancies to the natural condition, which are due to simulations made under some basic assumptions and limitations and that will be incorporated in the future studies for natural cloud condition.</p>

				<title>Variations in long term wind speed during different decades in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal</title>

				<page>0639-0653</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A study has been carried out by comparing the extreme wind speeds estimated based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data for 100 years return period using Fischer Tippet-1 (commonly known as Gumbel)and Weibull distributions for three locations (off Goa,Visakhapatnam and Machilipatnam)in the north Indian Ocean.The wind dataset for Goa is compared with that from ERA-40 data.For higher wind speeds ($12--20 m s^{â1}$ ),NCEP wind speed has higher percentage of occurrence than that of ERA-40.Analysis has shown slight upward trend in the annual maximum wind for location off Machilipatnam with an increase of $1.2cms^{â1}$ per year and a decreasing trend of $â1.3cms^{â1}$ per year in the case of Goa.The Weibull distribution with shape parameter 2 ï¬ts the annual maximum wind data better than FT-1 distribution.</p>

				<title>An experimental investigation to characterise soil macroporosity under different land use and land covers of northeast India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0655-0674</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Saturated macropore ï¬ow is the dominant hydrological process in tropical and subtropical hilly watersheds of northeast India.The process of inï¬ltration into saturated macroporous soils is primarily controlled by size,network,density,connectivity,saturation of surrounding soil matrix, and depthwise distribution of macropores.To understand the effects of local land use,land cover and management practices on soil macroporosity,colour dye inï¬ltration experiments were conducted with ten soil columns ($25 \times 25 \times 50 cm$)collected from different watersheds of the region under similar soil and agro-climatic zones.The sampling sites included two undisturbed forested hillslopes,two conventionally cultivated paddy ï¬elds,two forest lands abandoned after Jhum cultivation,and two paddy ï¬elds,one pineapple plot and one banana plot presently under active cultivation stage of the Jhum cycle.Digital image analyses of the obtained dye patterns showed that the inï¬ltration patterns differed signiï¬cantly for different sites with varying land use,land cover,and cultivation practices.Undisturbed forest soils showed high degree of soil macroporosity throughout the soil proï¬le,paddy ï¬elds revealed sealing of macropores at the topsoil due to hard pan formation,and Jhum cultivated plots showed disconnected subsoil macropores.The important parameters related to  soil macropores such as maximum and average size of macropores,number of active macropores,and depthwise distribution of macropores were estimated to characterise the soil macroporosity for the sites.These experimentally derived quantitative data of soil macro- porosity can have wide range of applications in the region such as water quality monitoring and groundwater pollution assessment due to preferential leaching of solutes and pesticides,study of soil structural properties and inï¬ltration behaviour of soils,investigation of ï¬ash ï¬oods in rivers, and hydrological modelling of the watersheds.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of phase chemistry and petrochemical aspects of SamchampiâSamteran differentiated alkaline complex of Mikir Hills, northeastern India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0675-0699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Samchampi âSamteran alkaline complex occurs as a plug-like pluton within the Precambrian granite gneisses of Mikir Hills,Assam,northeastern India and it is genetically related to Sylhet Traps.The intrusive complex is marked by dominant development of syenite within which ijolite â melteigite suite of rocks is emplaced with an arcuate outcrop pattern.Inliers of alkali pyroxenite and alkali gabbro occur within this ijolite âmelteigite suite of rocks.The pluton is also traversed by younger intrusives of nepheline syenite and carbonatite.Development of sporadic,lumpy magnetite ore bodies is also recorded within the pluton.Petrographic details of the constituent lithomembers of the pluton have been presented following standard nomenclatorial rules.Overall pyroxene compositions range from diopside to aegirine augite while alkali feldspars are typically orthoclase and plagioclase in syenite corresponds to oligoclase species.Phase chemistry of nepheline is suggestive of Na-rich alkaline character of the complex.Biotite compositions are typically restricted to a uniform compositional range and they belong to âbiotite âï¬eld in the relevant classiï¬cation scheme.Garnets (developed in syenite and melteigite)typically tend to be Ti-rich andradite,which on a closer scan can be further designated as melanites.Opaque minerals mostly correspond to magnetite.Use of Lindsley âs pyroxene thermometric method suggests an equilibration temperature from $\sim 450^\circ â600^\circ C$ for melteigite/alkali gabbro and $\sim 400^\circ C$ for syenite.Critical assessment of other thermometric methods reveals a temperature of equilibration of $\sim 700^\circ â1350^\circ C$ for ijolite âmelteigite suite of rocks in contrast to a relatively lower equilibration temperature of $\sim 600^\circ C$ for syenite. Geobarometric data based on pyroxene chemistry yield an equilibration pressure of 5.32 â7.72 kb for ijolite,melteigite,alkali pyroxenite,alkali gabbro and nepheline syenite.The dominant syenite member of the intrusive plug records a much higher ($\sim 11$ kb)equilibration pressure indicating a deeper level of intrusion.Major oxide variations of constituent lithomembers with respect to differentiation index (D.I.)corroborate a normal magmatic differentiation.A prominent role of liquid immiscibility is envisaged from ï¬eld geological,petrographic and petrochemical evidences. Tectonic discrimination diagrams involving clinopyroxene chemistry strongly suggest within plate alkaline affinity for the parental magma which is in conformity with the regional plume tectonics.</p>

					<p>The Gondwana sediments comprising ï¬ne-grained shales,carbonaceous shales,sandstones and the coal horizon in borecore RT-4 (approximately 547.00 m thick)from Tamra block,Raniganj Coal ï¬eld,Damodar Basin,are analyzed palynologically.Based on the distribution pattern of marker palynotaxa,two assemblage zones are identi ï¬ed.In the Barren Measures Formation,dominance of enveloping monosaccate (\textit {Densipollenites} )along with striate bisaccate (\textit {Striatopodocarpites,Fauni- pollenites} )pollen taxa,and the FAD âs of \textit {Kamthisaccites} and \textit {Arcuatipollenites} observed at 30.75, have equated this strata (30.75 â227.80 m thick)with the Raniganj Formation of Late Permian in  age.Downwards in the Barakar Formation,between 423.80 â577.70 m depths,an abundance of non-striate (\textit {Scheuringipollenites} )and striate(\textit {Faunipollenites} and \textit {Striatopodocarpites} )bisaccate pollen taxa is observed,that dates late Early Permian in age.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The terpenoid composition of resins from the Miocene lignite horizons from the Kerala âKonkan Coast,western India was analyzed by Curie-point pyrolysis âgas chromatography âmass spectrometry (Cupy âGC âMS).The major pyrolysates were cadalene-based bicyclic sesquiterpenoids including some $C_{30}-C_{31}$ bicadinenes and bicadinanes typical of dammar resin from angiosperm plants of Dipterocarpaceae family.These plants are typically supported by tropical climates which the western Indian region was known to have experienced during early Tertiary period.The present study suggests that these palaeoclimatic conditions persisted until at least the Miocene epoch.These sesquiterpenoids which are commonly detected in many SE Asian crude oils may be utilised as useful biomarkers for petroleum exploration in the western Indian region.</p>

				<title>Assessment of flexural analysis applied to the SumatraâJava subduction zone</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0717-0730</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Indian Ocean subduction zone is one of the most active plate margins of the globe as evident from its vast record of great magnitude earthquake and tsunami events.We use Bouguer admittance (Morlet isostatic response function)in Sumatra âJava subduction zones comprising both the subduction and over-riding plates to determine the lithospheric mechanical strength variations. We determine effective elastic thickness \textit {(T_e)} for ï¬ve oceanic windows (size $990 \times 990 km^{2}$ )by analyzing the admittance using Bouguer gravity and bathymetry data.The results show bimodal \textit {T_e} values &mt; 20 km for Sumatra and 20 â40 km for Java.The lower bimodal values obtained for Sumatra appears to correlate well with the zones of historical seismicity.This is in sharp contrast with Java subduction zone,which shows higher \textit {T_e} values (20 â40 km)and apparently associated with low magnitude earthquakes.We suggest a strong and wide interseismic coupling for Sumatra between the subducting and over-riding plates,and deeper mantle contributing to low strength,shallow focus âhigh magnitude seismicity and \textit {vice versa} for Java,leading to their seismogenic zonation.</p>

				<title>Estimates of source parameters of \textit {M} 4.9 Kharsali earthquake using waveform modelling</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0731-0743</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the computation of time series of the 22 July 2007 \textit {M} 4.9 Kharsali earthquake. It occurred close to the Main Central Thrust (MCT)where seismic gap exists.The main shock and 17 aftershocks were located by closely spaced eleven seismograph stations in a network that involved VSAT based real-time seismic monitoring.The largest aftershock of \textit {M} 3.5 and other aftershocks occurred within a small volume of $4 \times 4$ km horizontal extent and between depths of 10 and 14 km. The values of seismic moment \textit {(M_o)} determined using P-wave spectra and Brune âs model based on \textit {f^2} spectral shape ranges from $10^{18}$ to $10^{23}$ dyne-cm.The initial aftershocks occurred at greater depth compared to the later aftershocks.The time series of ground motion have been computed for recording sites using geometric ray theory and Green âs function approach.The method for computing time series consists in integrating the far-ï¬eld contributions of Green âs function for a number of distributed point source.The generated waveforms have been compared with the observed ones.It has been inferred that the Kharsali earthquake occurred due to a northerly dipping low angle thrust fault at a depth of 14 km taking strike $N279^\circ E$, dip $14^\circ $ and rake $117^\circ $. There are two regions on the fault surface which have larger slip amplitudes (asperities)and the rupture which has been considered as circular in nature initiated from the asperity at a greater depth shifting gradually upwards.The two asperities cover only 10%of the total area of the causative fault plane.However,detailed seismic imaging of these two asperities can be corroborated with structural heterogeneities associated with causative fault to understand how seismogenesis is inï¬uenced by strong or weak structural barriers in the region.</p>

				<title>Soil-gas helium and surface-waves detection of fault zones in granitic bedrock</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0745-0751</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fracture and fault networks are conduits that facilitate groundwater movement in hard-rock terrains.Soil-gas helium emanometry has been utilized in Wailapally watershed,near Hyderabad in southern India,for the detection of fracture and fault zones in a granite basement terrain having a thin regolith.Based on satellite imagery and geologic mapping,three sites were selected for detailed investigation.High spatial resolution soil-gas samples were collected at every one meter at a depth of &lt;1.5m along 100 m long proï¬les (3 in number).In addition,deep shear-wave images were also obtained using the multichannel analysis of surface waves.The study clearly indicates several soil-gas helium anomalies (above 200 ppb)along the pro ï¬les,where the shear-wave velocity images also show many near-surface vertical low velocity zones.We thus interpret that the soil-gas helium anomalous zones and the vertical low-velocity zones are probable traces of fault/fracture zones that could be efficient natural recharge zones and potential groundwater conduits.The result obtained from this study demonstrates the efficacy of an integrated approach of soil-gas helium and the seismic methods for mapping groundwater resource zones in granite/gneiss provinces.</p>

				<title>Chemistry of snow and lake water in Antarctic region</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0753-0762</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface snow and lake water samples were collected at different locations around Indian station at Antarctica, Maitri, during December 2004--March 2005 and December 2006--March 2007.Samples were analyzed for major chemical ions.It is found that average pH value of snow is 6.1.Average pH value of lake water with low chemical content is 6.2 and of lake water with high chemical content is 6.5.The $Na^{+}$ and $Cl^{â}$ are the most abundantly occurring ions at Antarctica.Considerable amount of $SO^{2-}_{4}$ is also found in the surface snow and the lake water which is attributed to the oxidation of DMS produced by marine phytoplankton.Neutralization of acidic components of snow is mainly done by $NH^{+}_{4}$ and $Mg^{2+}$. The $Mg^{2+} ,Ca^{2+}$ and $K^{+}$ are nearly equally effective in neutralizing the acidic components in lake water.The $NH^{+}_{4}$ and $SO^{2-}_{4}$ occur over the Antarctica region mostly in the form of $(NH_4)2SO_4$.</p>

				<title>Estimation of infiltration rate, run-off and sediment yield under simulated rainfall experiments in upper Pravara Basin, India: Effect of slope angle and grass-cover</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0763-0773</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main objective of this study is to measure the effect of slope and grass-cover on in ï¬ltration rate,run-off and sediment yield under simulated rainfall conditions in a badland area located in the upper Pravara Basin in western India.An automatic rainfall simulator was designed following Dunne \textit {et al} (1980)and considering the local conditions.Experiments were conducted on six selected experimental ï¬elds of $2 \times 2$ m within the catchment with distinct variations in surface characteristics âgrass-covered area with gentle slope,recently ploughed gently sloping area,area covered by crop residue (moderate slope),bare badland with steep slope,gravelly surface with near ï¬at slope and steep slope with grass-cover.The results indicate subtle to noteworthy variations amongst the plots depending on their slope angle and surface characteristics.An important ï¬nding that emerges from the study is that the grass-cover is the most effective measure in inducing inï¬ltration and in turn minimizing run-off and sediment yield.Sediment yields are lowest in gently sloping grass-covered surfaces and highest in bare badland surfaces with steep slopes.These ï¬ndings have enormous implication for this area,because over 2/3 area is characterized by bare and steep slopes.</p>

				<page>0775-0781</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Since the beginning of the summer monsoon 2009,experimental mesoscale weather forecasts in real time are being generated using WRF model by the Meteorology and Oceanography Group at the Space Applications Centre (ISRO)and are disseminated through MOSDAC (www.mosdac.gov.in) to various users.To begin with,the 12 h,24 h and 48 h forecasts for the western India region are made available.A study is undertaken to comprehensively assess the cloudiness prediction performance of WRF model.The evaluations have been made over the three months period during monsoon 2009.INSAT cloud imagery data has been used as a reference for these evaluations. The veriï¬cation strategy includes computation of various skill scores.It is seen that probability of detection (POD)of cloud is 84%and the false alarm rate (FAR)is around 18%.It is hoped that this assessment will provide information on the use of these forecasts in various applications.</p>

				<title>Investigating origin of the inadequate medium range predictability of the lower tropospheric ultra-long waves in tropics</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0783-0802</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The predictability of planetary or ultra-long scale waves is limited by the large growth of errors in these scales in almost all the medium range forecast models.Understanding the cause for the enormous build up of error is,therefore,a necessary task for improving the prediction of planetary waves.A diagnostic analysis of the systematic error energetics has been performed in the Global Forecast System model to investigate the reasons for poor predictability of the lower tropospheric ultra-long waves (wavenumber bands 1 â4)in tropics using the analysis âforecast system of horizon- tal wind ï¬eld at 850 hPa level during the boreal summer period.For this purpose,systematic error energy is computed in spatial as well as in wavenumber domain.Non-linear inter-scale transfer of error has been formulated and evaluated through energy exchanges among participating triads.The study reveals that the error is generated in the prognostic model initially with a small magnitude at the different locations around tropical convergence zone (TCZ)attributed to the inaccuracy in representing different physical processes like cumulus convection applied in the model.At subsequent evolution of forecasts,error increases and spreads along the TCZ due to its non-linear advection to the higher scales and eventually to the ultra-long scales attributed to the inherent dynamics of the model evaluated through the process of wave âwave exchange of error energy in terms of the triad interactions.The continuous generation and then,non-linear propagation of error up to the planetary scales in the course of prediction increase the uncertainty in ultra-long scales which actually inhibit to predict accurately the planetary scale waves in tropics during medium range forecasts.This work suggests caveats to the modeler âs community in the predictability study of tropical ultra-long waves.</p>

				<title>Seaward dipping reflectors along the SW continental margin of India: Evidence for volcanic passive margin</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0803-0813</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Multi-channel seismic reï¬ection proï¬les across the southwest continental margin of India (SWCMI) show presence of westerly dipping seismic reï¬ectors beneath sedimentary strata along the western ï¬ank of the Laccadive Ridge ânorthernmost part of the Chagos âLaccadive Ridge system.Velocity structure,seismic character,2D gravity model and geographic locations of the dipping reï¬ectors suggest that these reï¬ectors are volcanic in origin,which are interpreted as Seaward Dipping Reï¬ectors (SDRs).</p>
					<p>The SDRs;15 to 27 km wide overlain by $\sim $1 km thick sediment;are observed at three locations and characterized by stack of laterally continuous,divergent and off-lapping reï¬ectors.Occurrence of SDRs along western ï¬ank of the Laccadive Ridge adjacent to oceanic crust of the Arabian Basin and 2D crustal model deduced from free-air gravity anomaly suggest that they are genetically related to incipient volcanism during separation of Madagascar from India.</p>
					<p>We suggest that (i)SWCMI is a volcanic passive margin developed during India âMadagascar breakup in the Late Cretaceous,and (ii)continent âocean transition lies at western margin of the Laccadive Ridge,west of feather edge of the SDRs.Occurrence of SDRs on western ï¬ank of the Laccadive Ridge and inferred zone of transition from continent to ocean further suggest continental nature of crust of the Laccadive Ridge.</p>

				<title>Mafic dykes at the southwestern margin of Eastern Ghats belt: Evidence of rifting and collision</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0815-0823</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The southwestern margin of the Eastern Ghats Belt characteristically exposes ma ï¬c dykes intruding massif-type charnockites.Dykes of olivine basalt of alkaline composition have characteristic trace element signatures comparable with Ocean Island Basalt (OIB).Most importantly strong positive Nb anomaly and low values of Zr/Nb ratio are consistent with OIB source of the maï¬c dykes.K âAr isotopic data indicate two cooling ages at 740 and 530 Ma.The Pan-African thermal event could be related to reactivation of major shear zones and represented by leuco-granite vein along minor shear bands.And 740 Ma cooling age may indicate the low grade metamorphic imprints,noted in some of the dykes.Although no intrusion age could be determined from the present dataset,it could be constrained by some age data of the host charnockite gneiss and Alkaline rocks of the adjacent Prakasam Province.Assuming an intrusion age of $\sim $1 .3 Ga,Sr âNd isotopic composition of the dykes indicate that they preserved time-integrated LREE enrichment.In view of the chemical signatures of OIB source,the ma ï¬c dykes could as well be related to continental rifting,around 1.3 Ga,which may have been initiated by intra-plate volcanism.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Neoproterozoic Bhander Group in the Son Valley,central India conformably overlying the Rewa Group,is the uppermost subdivision of the Vindhyan Supergroup dominantly composed of arenites, carbonates and shales.In Maihar âNagod area,a thick pile of unmetamorphosed clastic sedimentary rocks of Bhander Group is exposed,which provides a unique opportunity to study Neoproterozoic basin development through provenance and tectonic interpretations.The provenance discrimination and tectonic setting interpretations are based on modal analysis and whole rock geochemistry.The average framework composition of the detrital sediments composed of quartz and sedimentary lithic fragments are classiï¬ed as quartz arenite to sublitharenite.The sandstone geochemically re ï¬ects high $SiO_2$ moderate $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and low CaO and $Na_{2}O$ type arenite.The high concentration of HFSE such as Zr,Hf,and Th/Sc,Th/U ratios in these sandstones indicate a mixed provenance.The chondrite normalized REE pattern shows moderate to strong negative Eu anomaly which suggests that major part of the sediments were derived from the granitic source area.The sandstone tectonic discrimination diagrams and various geochemical plots suggest that the provenance of the lower and upper Bhander sandstone formations was continental interior to recycled orogen.</p>

				<title>Field evidences of secondary surface ruptures occurred during the 20 February 1956 EskiÅehir earthquake in the NW Anatolia</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Surface rupture and source fault of the 20 February 1956 Eski Â¸sehir earthquake have been a matter of debate that potentially contributes towards the understanding of the active deformation and seismic risk in the highly populated NW Anatolia.Field observations on the two fault segments (namely KavacÄ±k and Uludere faults)in the north of the Eski Â¸sehir graben revealed evidences of co-seismic surface rupture and mass movements during the Eski Â¸sehir earthquake.Surface rupture was observed as a 2.5 m wide,a 100 m long and ca.20 cm deep asymmetric depression in the G Â¨um Â¨u Â¸sl Â¨u valley, 2 km east of the Uludere village.A trench dug on this depression con ï¬rms a prominent high-angle south dipping fault (dominantly left lateral strike slip)and two faint north-dipping antithetics as clear noticeable shear zones in organic-rich thick soil.Mass failures are particularly observed in spring depressions ï¬lled with loose torrent and carbonaceous material in front of the fault scarp. Some rock slides of several tens of meters in size that obviously require signiï¬cantly high ground shaking were also developed on steep fault scarps.The orientation of the principal stress tensor as deduced from the surface rupture of the Eski Â¸sehir earthquake displays clear inconsistency with the geometry of prominent faults in the area.We concluded that this disagreement may be explained by a curved surface rupture.The western and eastern tips of this rupture are EW trending and the probable NW-running part in the middle would correspond to the bounding zone between two right-stepping faults.</p>

				<title>Relationship between chemical composition and magnetic susceptibility in the alkaline volcanics from the Isparta area, SW Turkey</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0853-0860</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Potassium-rich volcanic rocks in the Isparta area (SW Turkey)consist mainly of older (Pliocene) volcanic rock suites (e.g.,lamprophyre,basaltic trachyandesite,trachyandesite,trachyte)and younger (Quaternary)caldera forming lava dome/ï¬ows (e.g.,tephriphonolite,trachyte)and pyroclastics (ash/pumice fall deposits and ignimbritic ï¬ows).The magnetic susceptibility (\textit {K}) was performed for both groups.The magnetic susceptibility value of the less evolved rocks characterized by $SiO_{2}$ &mt; 57 wt%(e.g.,basaltic trachyandesite,tephriphonolite,lamprophyric rocks)and having mostly maï¬c phenocrysts such as pyroxene,amphibole,and biotite--phlogopite is over 10 ($10^{â3}$ [SI ]).Fine to medium-grained and subhedral to anhedral opaque minerals are scattered especially in the matrix phase of the less evolved volcanic rocks.However,the \textit {K} value of the more evolved rocks (e.g.,trachyte and trachyandesites)with $SiO_2$ over 57 wt%vary between 0.1 and 28,but most of them below 10.SI values are negatively correlated with $SiO_2, Na_{2}O$, but positively correlated with $Fe_{2}O_{3}, CaO, MnO, P_{2}O_{5}$ and MgO contents,suggesting inverse variation of SI with fractionation of potassic magma.That is to say that less evolved volcanic rocks have relatively higher magnetic susceptibility values in the volcanic suite.Fine to medium-grained and subhedral to anhedral Fe-Ti oxides are scattered mainly in the matrix phase of the less evolved volcanics,presumably cause the pronounced relatively higher magnetic susceptibility.</p>

				<title>An overview on geochemistry of Proterozoic massif-type anorthosites and associated rocks</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>A critical study of 311 published WR chemical analyses,isotopic and mineral chemistry of anorthosites and associated rocks from eight Proterozoic massif anorthosite complexes of India, North America and Norway indicates marked similarities in mineralogy and chemistry among similar rock types.The anorthosite and maï¬c-leucomaï¬c rocks (e.g.,leuconorite,leucogabbro, leucotroctolite,anorthositic gabbro,gabbroic anorthosite,etc.)constituting the major part of the massifs are characterized by higher $Na_{2}O + K_{2}O, Al_{2}O_{3}, SiO_{2}$ Mg# and Sr contents,low in plagioclase incompatible elements and REE with positive Eu anomalies.Their $\delta^{18}$ O%0 (5.7 â7.5), initial $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$ (0.7034 â0.7066)and $\varepsilon _{Nd}$ values (+1.14 to +5.5)suggest a depleted mantle origin. The Fe-rich dioritic rocks occurring at the margin of massifs have isotopic,chemical and mineral composition more close to anorthosite âmaï¬c-leucomaï¬c rocks.However,there is a gradual decrease in plagioclase content,An content of plagioclase and $X_{Mg}$ of orthopyroxene,and an increase in maï¬c silicates,oxide minerals content,plagioclase incompatible elements and REE from anorthosite â maï¬c-leucomaï¬c rocks to Fe-rich dioritic rocks.The Fe-rich dioritic rocks are interpreted as residual melt from mantle derived high-Al gabbro melt,which produced the anorthosite and maï¬c-leucomaï¬c rocks.Mineralogically and chemically,the K-rich felsic rocks are distinct from anorthosite âmaï¬c-leucomaï¬c-Fe-rich dioritic suite.They have higher $\delta^{18}O$ values (6.8 â10.8%) and initial $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$ (0.7067--0.7104). By contrast,the  K-rich felsic suites are products of melting of crustal precursors.</p>

				<title>Radiative transfer simulations for the MADRAS imager of Megha-Tropiques</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the radiative transfer simulations for the passive microwave radiometer onboard the proposed Indian climate research satellite Megha-Tropiques due to be launched in 2011. These simulations have been performed by employing an in-house polarized radiative transfer code for raining systems ranging from depression and tropical cyclones to the Indian monsoon. For the sake of validation and completeness, simulations have also been done for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)âs Microwave Imager (TMI) of the highly successful TRMM mission of NASA and JAXA. The paper is essentially divided into two parts: (a) Radiometer response with specific focus on high frequency channels in both the radiometers is discussed in detail with a parametric study of the effect of four hydrometeors (cloud liquid water, cloud ice, precipitating water and precipitating ice) on the brightness temperatures. The results are compared with TMI measurements wherever possible. (b) Development of a neural network-based fast radiative transfer model is elucidated here. The goal is to speed up the computational time involved in the simulation of brightness temperatures, necessitated by the need for quick and online retrieval strategies. The neural network model uses hydrometeor profiles as inputs and simulates spectral microwave brightness temperature at multiple frequencies as output. A huge database is generated by executing the in-house radiative transfer code for seven different cyclones occurred in North Indian Ocean region during the period 2001â2006. A part of the dataset is used to train the network while the remainder is used for testing purposes. For the purpose of testing, a typical scene from the Southwest monsoon rain is also considered. The results obtained are very encouraging and show that the neural network is able to mimic the underlying physics of the radiative transfer simulations with a correlation coefficient of over 99%.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>INSAT-3D is the new generation Indian satellite designed for improved Earth observations through two payloads â \textit {Imager} and \textit {Sounder}. Study was conducted with an aim of simulating satellite level signal over land in the infrared channels of the Imager payload using a radiative transfer model MODTRAN. Satellite level at-sensor radiance corresponding to all four infrared channels of INSAT-3D Imager payload is obtained using MODTRAN and sensitivity of at-sensor radiance was inferred as a function of input parameters namely, surface temperature, emissivity, view angle and atmospheric water vapour, which is helpful in understanding the signal simulation scheme needed for retrieving a very critical parameter namely, land surface temperature.</p>

				<title>Experimental real-time multi-model ensemble (MME) prediction of rainfall during Monsoon 2008: Large-scale medium-range aspects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0052</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Realistic simulation/prediction of the Asian summer monsoon rainfall on various spaceâtime scales is a challenging scientific task. Compared to mid-latitudes, a proportional skill improvement in the prediction of monsoon rainfall in the medium range has not happened in recent years. Global models and data assimilation techniques are being improved for monsoon/tropics. However, multi-model ensemble (MME) forecasting is gaining popularity, as it has the potential to provide more information for practical forecasting in terms of making a consensus forecast and handling model uncertainties. As major centers are exchanging model output in near real-time, MME is a viable inexpensive way of enhancing the forecasting skill and information content. During monsoon 2008, on an experimental basis, an MME forecasting of large-scale monsoon precipitation in the medium range was carried out in real-time at National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), India. Simple ensemble mean (EMN) giving equal weight to member models, bias-corrected ensemble mean (BCEMn) and MME forecast, where different weights are given to member models, are the products of the algorithm tested here. In general, the aforementioned products from the multi-model ensemble forecast system have a higher skill than individual model forecasts. The skill score for the Indian domain and other sub-regions indicates that the BCEMn produces the best result, compared to EMN and MME. Giving weights to different models to obtain an MME product helps to improve individual member models only marginally. It is noted that for higher rainfall values, the skill of the global model rainfall forecast decreases rapidly beyond day-3, and hence for day-4 and day-5, the MME products could not bring much improvement over member models. However, up to day-3, the MME products were always better than individual member models.</p>

				<title>Impact of additional surface observation network on short range weather forecast during summer monsoon 2008 over Indian subcontinent</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0053-0064</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The three dimensional variational data assimilation scheme (3D-Var) is employed in the recently developed Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Assimilation experiments have been conducted to assess the impact of Indian Space Research Organisationâs (ISRO) Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) surface observations (temperature and moisture) on the short range forecast over the Indian region. In this study, two experiments, CNT (without AWS observations) and EXP (with AWS observations) were made for 24-h forecast starting daily at 0000 UTC during July 2008. The impact of assimilation of AWS surface observations were assessed in comparison to the CNT experiment. The spatial distribution of the improvement parameter for temperature, relative humidity and wind speed from one month assimilation experiments demonstrated that for 24-h forecast, AWS observations provide valuable information. Assimilation of AWS observed temperature and relative humidity improved the analysis as well as 24-h forecast. The rainfall prediction has been improved due to the assimilation of AWS data, with the largest improvement seen over the Western Ghat and eastern India.</p>

				<title>Doppler SODAR observations of the temperature structure parameter during monsoon season over a tropical rural station, Gadanki</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0065-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Doppler SODAR (Sound Detection and Ranging) measurements over a tropical Indian station at National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL), Gadanki ($13.5^\circ N, 79.2^\circ E$) during two consecutive monsoon seasons, 2007 and 2008, are investigated to study the influence of mechanically generated turbulence on temperature structure parameter ($C^{2}_{T}$) in the convective boundary layer. Increase in the $C^{2}_{T}$ is observed after the arrival of monsoon for both seasons. Contribution of vertical wind shear in horizontal wind component to $C^{2}_{T}$ due to zonal winds is responsible for the increase observed in the temperature structure parameter which is inferred from the results obtained. $C^{2}_{T}$ is found to be increased by an order of 2 in both the lower and upper altitudes, respectively. Magnitude of wind speed is reported to be doubled with the arrival of monsoon. It is also observed that, southwest monsoon wind modulates the day-to-day variations of wind pattern over this station during the onset phase of monsoon season. The lower variability observed at lower height is attributed to the complex topography surrounding this region.</p>

				<title>Variability in surface inversion characteristics over India in winter during the recent decades</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0073-0084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The variation in surface inversions during the recent decades over 20 stations in the Indian region is documented. Radiosonde data at 00UTC for the period 1971â2000 has been used to compute the inversion frequency. The depth and strength of the inversions as well as the wind speed through the inversion layer have also been computed. The frequency of inversions at stations north of $20^\circ N$ is $\sim 20â60%$ higher than stations located south of $20^\circ N$. Moreover, all the stations show frequencies increasing from the 1st to the 3rd decade. Most of the stations show decreasing depth and increasing strength significant at 99% level. With the exception of Nagpur and Hyderabad which show high frequency of very deep inversions increasing from the 1st to the 3rd decade, the decadal variations of inversion depth at most of the other stations show that shallow and moderate inversions occur more frequently than deep or very deep inversions. Decadal variations in inversion strength show weak inversion frequencies decreasing from the 1st to the 3rd decade while moderate/strong inversions occur more frequently at most stations. Frequencies of very strong inversions are low or absent. Wind speeds are either weak or moderate with frequencies increasing from the 1st to the 3rd decade. Low frequency of strong winds and negligible frequency of very strong winds are observed.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0085-0098</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Water samples were collected from different formations of Gadilam river basin and analyzed to assess the major ion chemistry and suitability of water for domestic and drinking purposes. Chemical parameters of groundwater such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), Sodium ($Na^+$), Potassium ($K^+$), Calcium ($Ca^+$), Magnesium ($Mg^+$), Bicarbonate ($HCO_{3}^-$), Sulphate ($SO_{4}^-$), Phosphate ($PO_{4}^-$) and Silica ($H_{4}SiO_{4}$) were determined. The geochemical study of the aquatic systems of the Gadilam river basin show that the groundwater is near-acidic to alkaline and mostly oxidizing in nature. Higher concentration of Sodium and Chloride indicates leaching of secondary salts and anthropogenic impact by industry and salt water intrusion. Spatial distribution of EC indicates anthropogenic impact in the downstream side of the basin. The concentration levels of trace metals such as Iron (Fe), Lead (Pb), Nickel (Ni), Bromide (Br), Iodide (I) and Aluminium (Al) have been compared with the world standard. Interpretation of data shows that some trace metals such as Al, Ni and Pb exceed the acceptable limit of world standard. Geophysical study was carried out to identify the weathered zone in the hard rock and contaminated zone by anthropogenic impact in the downstream of river Gadilam. A few of the groundwater samples in the study area were found to be unsuitable for domestic and drinking purposes.</p>

				<title>Measurement of marine productivity using $^{15}N$ and $^{13}C$ tracers: Some methodological aspects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0099-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Various experiments involving the measurement of new, regenerated and total productivity using $^{15}N$ and $^{13}C$ tracers were carried out in the Bay of Bengal (BOB) and in the Arabian Sea. Results from $^{15}N$ tracer experiments indicate that nitrate uptake can be underestimated by experiments with incubation time &mt; 4 hours. Indirect evidence suggests pico- and nano-phytoplankton, on their dominance over microphytoplankton, can also influence the f-ratios. Difference in energy requirement for assimilation of different nitrogen compounds decides the preferred nitrogen source during the early hours of incubation. Variation in light intensity during incubation also plays a significant role in the assimilation of nitrogen. Results from time course experiments with both $^{15}N$ and $^{13}C$ tracers suggest that photoinhibition appears significant in BOB and the Arabian Sea during noon. A significant correlation has been found in the productivity values obtained using $^{15}N$ and $^{13}C$ tracers.</p>

				<title>Late Quaternary changes in surface productivity and oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the northwestern Arabian Sea: Micropaleontologic and sedimentary record at ODP site 728A</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0113-0121</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Changes in the abundance of selected planktic foraminiferal species and some sedimentological parameters at ODP site 728A were examined to understand the fluctuations in the surface productivity and deep sea oxygenation in the NW Arabian Sea during last $\sim 540$ kyr. The increased relative abundances of high fertility taxa, i.e., \textit {Globigerinita glutinata} and \textit {Globigerina bulloides} mainly during interglacial intervals indicate intense upwelling. Strong SW summer monsoon probably increased the upwelling in the western Arabian Sea during interglacial intervals and caused high surface productivities due to the lateral transport of eutrophic waters. Most of the glacial periods (i.e., MIS 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12) are characterized by higher relative abundances of \textit {Neogloboquadrina pachyderma} and \textit {Neogloboquadrina dutertrei} associated with \textit {Globigerinoides ruber}. The more stratified condition and deep mixed layer due to increased NE winter monsoon are mainly responsible for the higher relative abundances of \textit {N. pachyderma} during glacial periods. Some of the glacial intervals (i.e., MIS 6 and 8) are also characterized by pteropod spikes reflecting deepening of aragonite compensation depth (ACD) and relatively less intense oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in this region due to deep sea mixing and thermocline ventilation, and relatively less intense surface productivity during winter monsoon. The interglacial periods are largely devoid of pteropod shells indicating more aragonite dissolution due to increased intensity of OMZ in the northwestern Arabian Sea.</p>
					<p>In general, the interglacial periods are characterized by low sediment accumulation rates than the glacial intervals. On an average, the total biogenic carbonate percentages were higher during interglacial and during periods of higher surface productivity. Most terrigenous material was trapped on shelf during intervals of high sea level stands of interglacial, whereas more erosion of shelf increased the sedimentation rates during glacial periods. In addition, the fragmentation record may be the result of changes in intensity and vertical distribution of the OMZ with time. During glacial intervals, the lower boundary of the OMZ probably was in a shallower position than during interglacial periods, when dissolution increased as a result of higher organic production. The higher rates of sinking organic matter result into a stronger OMZ as oxygen is used to disintegrate the organic matter. This process lowers the $p^H$ of water which results into increased dissolution of calcium carbonate.</p>

				<title>Sand and clay mineralogy of sal forest soils of the Doon Siwalik Himalayas</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0123-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The peteromineralogical characterization of the soil was carried out for the 12 soil profiles exposed in the \textit {Shorea robusta} dominated forests of the Siwalik forest division, Dehradun. The quartz was observed as the dominating light mineral fraction (64â80%) in all the profiles studied. Biotite, hornblende, zircon, tourmaline, rutile and opaques comprising of iron minerals constituted the heavy mineral fraction (20%). The mineralogy of both the sand and clay fractions revealed a mixed mineralogy. The clay minerals in the order of their dominance were vermiculite, illite, kaolinite and mixed layer minerals. The presence of vermiculite and illite in appreciable quantities indicates that these were synthesized from the K-rich soil solution, as orthoclase and micas were present in significant quantities in the sand minerals. The mineral suites identified in the study shows that the geological, climatological and topographical factors of the region collectively played a dominant role in their formation and transformation. After critical appraisal of the results, it may be deduced that the mineralogical composition, physicochemical properties and total elemental analysis of the soils do not show any deficiency of the bases and other plant nutrients in general. The inherent fertility of the soil is good as indicated by the sand and clay mineralogy of the soil and the biotite and feldspar together with the mica is an important source of nutrients for the vegetation in the soils of the Doon valley.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0145-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Andesite and dacite from Barren and Narcondam volcanic islands of Andaman subduction zone are composed of plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, olivine, titanomagnetite, magnesio-hornblende and rare quartz grains. In this study, we use the results of mineral chemical analyses of the calc-alkaline rock suite of rocks as proxies for magma mixing and mingling processes. Plagioclase, the most dominant mineral, shows zoning which includes oscillatory, patchy, multiple and repetitive zonation and âfrittedâ or âsieveâ textures. Zoning patterns in plagioclase phenocrysts and abrupt fluctuations in An content record different melt conditions in a dynamic magma chamber. âFrittedâ zones ($An_{55}$) are frequently overgrown by thin calcic ($An_{72}$) plagioclase rims over well-developed dissolution surfaces. These features have probably resulted from mixing of a more silicic magma with the host andesite. Olivine and orthopyroxene with reaction and overgrowth rims (corona) suggest magma mixing processes. We conclude that hybrid magma formed from the mixing of mafic and felsic magma by two-stage processes initial intrusion of hotter mafic melt (andesitic) followed by cooler acidic melt at later stage.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of the role of rock properties in the development of potholes: A case study of the Indrayani knickpoint, Maharashtra</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0157-0165</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The most conspicuous erosional features associated with constricted bedrock channel reaches and knickpoints are potholes. The presence and morphology of potholes have been attributed to a number of factors by earlier researchers. Amongst these factors, the role of substrate rock properties has received very little quantitative attention. The main objective of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the physical properties of bedrock in order to test the possible influences of rock properties on the occurrence and morphology of potholes. The area selected for this study is a large scabland area developed by the Indrayani river at Shelarwadi near Pune. This site is ideally suited for the study since it is featured by wide straths, multiple inner channels and several hundred potholes. A transect-based quadrat method was used in this study. Within each quadrat, the pothole dimensions, the joint length, joint direction, the rock mass strength and the distance from active channel were measured. The analysis reveals a weak correlation between pothole size and rock properties. The distance from the active channel emerges as the most significant factor, suggesting that the hydraulics of flows is the key factor and substrate characteristics play only a secondary role.</p>

The fluvio-lacustrine deposits of the Lower Triassic Panchet Formation of the Damodar valley in the study area preserve various soft-sediment deformation structures such as slump folds, convolute laminae, flame structures, dish-and-pillar structures, sandstone dykes, pseudonodules and syn-sedimentary faults. Although such soft-sediment deformation structures maybe formed by various processes, in the present area the association of these structures, their relation to the adjacent sedimentary rocks and the tectonic and depositional setting of the formation suggest that these structures are seismogenic. Movements along the basin margin and the intra-basinal faults and resultant seismicity with moderate magnitude (2â5 on Richter scale) are thought to have been responsible for the soft-sediment deformations.</p>

				<title>Influence of shear velocity on frictional characteristics of rock surface</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0183-0191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Understanding the fundamental issues related with the effect of shear velocity on frictional characteristics at the interface of rock surfaces is an important issue. In this paper, strain-rate dependence on friction is investigated in relation to sliding behaviour under normal load. The phenomenon of stick-slip of granite and shaly sandstone with a tribometer at constant rate of strain under normal loads was observed.</p>
					<p>Friction at the interface of the rock samples was developed by increasing shear strain at a constant rate by applying constant velocity using the tribometer. For shaly sandstone, state parameters (\textit {a} and \textit {b}) played a major role in determining the friction values and roughness of the contact surfaces as well. Higher values of \textit {b} for shaly sandstone may be attributed to the fact that its surface had a greater number of pronounced asperities. Rubbing between the surfaces does not mean that surface becomes smoother. This is because of variation of friction between surfaces.</p>

				<title>Slab detachment of subducted Indo-Australian plate beneath Sunda arc, Indonesia</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0193-0204</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Necking, tearing, slab detachment and subsequently slab loss complicate the subduction zone processes and slab architecture. Based on evidences which include patterns of seismicity, seismic tomography and geochemistry of arc volcanoes, we have identified a horizontal slab tear in the subducted Indo-Australian slab beneath the Sunda arc. It strongly reflects on trench migration, and causes along-strike variations in vertical motion and geochemically distinct subduction-related arc magmatism. We also propose a model for the geodynamic evolution of slab detachment.</p>

				<title>One-dimensional unsteady solute transport along unsteady flow through inhomogeneous medium</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0205-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The one-dimensional linear advectionâdiffusion equation is solved analytically by using the Laplace integral transform. The solute transport as well as the flow field is considered to be unsteady, both of independent patterns. The solute dispersion occurs through an inhomogeneous semi-infinite medium. Hence, velocity is considered to be an increasing function of the space variable, linearly interpolated in a finite domain in which solute dispersion behaviour is studied. Dispersion is considered to be proportional to the square of the spatial linear function. Thus, the coefficients of the advectionâdiffusion equation are functions of both the independent variables, but the expression for each coefficient is considered in degenerate form. These coefficients are reduced into constant coefficients with the help of a new space variable, introduced in our earlier works, and new time variables. The source of the solute is considered to be a stationary uniform point source of pulse type.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of RTK-GPS and Total Station for applications in land surveying</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0215-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Accuracies of Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning (RTK-GPS) system and Total Station (TS) were investigated in GIS environment. In geostatistical evaluations, Kriging method was used with spherical, exponential, and Gaussian models. The survey results demonstrated that an area of 3.5 ha or smaller can be best explained with Gaussian model, while the larger areas require a spherical model. A vertical error of 60 cm and a horizontal error of 30 cm can be observed when the survey points outside the construction area are eliminated. The optimum area per survey point was calculated to be $20 \times 20 m^2$ to increase the accuracy. This case study showed that an inaccurate survey can result cost over estimations up to 27%.</p>

				<title>1420 Ma diabasic intrusives from the Mesoproterozoic Singhora Group, Chhattisgarh Supergroup, India: Implications towards non-plume intrusive activity</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0223-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Besides offering significant clues towards tracking the geochemical evolution of the mantle and architectural reconstruction of different âsupercontinentâ, geochronological and geochemical appraisal of igneous inputs are also important to bracket the depositional time frame of any lithopackage, particularly, the unfossiliferous sedimentary successions. The present study deals with diabasic intrusive within Mesoproterozoic Saraipalli Formation, which is an argillaceous constituent present at the basal part of nearly 400 m thick four-tiered unmetamorphosed but deformed sedimentary succession of Singhora Group, Chhattisgarh Supergroup, central India. The SEâNW trending intrusive comprises mainly of plagioclase and augite together with minor orthopyroxene, biotite and opaque minerals. Though some plagioclase laths are partially sericitized, the ophitic-to-subophitic texture of the rock is well preserved. Major and trace element geochemical data indicate that this intrusive is basalt-to-basaltic andesite in character and of subalkaline basalt affinity. Multi-element plot shows overall LILE-enrichment and enrichment of Pb and slight depletion of Nb and P, coupled with moderate La/Nb and Th/Nb ratios. Zr, Y and Nb ternary diagrams plot in the fields of within plate basalt. Selected HFSE ratios indicate a non-plume source with crustal assimilation/sediment mixing. SmâNd and RbâSr isotope data show that the intrusive has Srinitial and Ndinitial of 0.709377â0.706672 and 0.510919â0.510815, respectively. Positive $\varepsilon^{\textit t}Nd [{\textit t} = 1420 Ma]$ values (+0.3 to + 2.3) indicate depleted isotopic nature of their protolith. The calculated {\textit T}_{DM} age is 1.7â1.9 Ga. The mineral-whole rock isochron data (SmâNd systematics) of the intrusive implies an emplacement age of ca. 1420 Ma. Considering synchronous terrain boundary shear zone development in Bastar craton on the southeastern part of the Singhora basin, mafic magmatism in Eastern Ghats and large-scale basic intrusion in Sausar mobile belt, a major tectono-thermal event around 1400 Ma is surmised that affected eastern Indian craton. Moreover, geochronology of a bedded porcellanite unit (ca. 1500 Ma) at the base and a discordant basic intrusive (ca. 1420 Ma) allowed a unique opportunity to qualitatively offer an upper bound of time bracket for the deposition of Saraipalli Formation, i.e., $\sim 80$ Ma.</p>

				<title>Geochemical and SmâNd isotopic study of titanite from granitoid rocks of the eastern Dharwar craton, southern India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0237-0251</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Titanite occurs as an accessory phase in a variety of igneous rocks, and is known to concentrate geologically important elements such as U, Th, rare earth element (REE), Y and Nb. The differences in the abundances of the REEs contained in titanite from granitoid rocks could reflect its response to changes in petrogenetic variables such as temperature of crystallization, pressure, composition, etc. Widespread migmatization in the granodiorite gneisses occurring to the east of Kolar and Ramagiri schist belts of the eastern Dharwar craton resulted in the enrichment of the REEs in titanite relative to their respective host rocks. A compositional influence on the partitioning of REEs between titanite and the host rock/magma is also noticed. The relative enrichment of REEs in titanite from quartz monzodiorite is lower than that found in the granodioritic gneiss. Depletion of REE and HFSE (high field-strength elements) abundances in granitic magmas that have equilibrated with titanite during fractional crystallization or partial melting has been modelled. As little as 1% of titanite present in residual phases during partial melting or in residual melts during fractional crystallization can significantly lower the abundances of trace elements such as Nb, Y, Zr and REE which implies the significance of this accessory mineral as a controlling factor in trace element distribution in granitoid rocks. SmâNd isotope studies on titanite, hornblende and whole rock yield isochron ages comparable to the precise UâPb titanite ages, invoking the usefulness of SmâNd isochron ages involving minerals like titanite.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Saddle-shaped reticulate \textit {Nummulites} from the Early Oligocene rocks of Khari area, SW Kutch, India is reported here for the first time. Unusual shape of this \textit {Nummulites} is due to the curved nature of the coiling plane, indicating space constrained postembryonic test growth. With regular development of chambers, septa and septal filaments, the saddle-shaped \textit {Nummulites} constitutes the third morphotype of \textit {N.} cf. \textit {fichteli} Michelotti form A. Other morphotypes of the species reported earlier include inflated lenticular and conical tests. Multiple morphotypes of \textit {N.} cf. \textit {fichteli} form A indicates varied test growth in response to substrate conditions. Morphological variability exhibited by \textit {N.} cf. \textit {fichteli} form A from Kutch and some Early Oligocene reticulate \textit {Nummulites} from the Far East are comparable. This faunal suite is morphologically distinct from the contemporary reticulate \textit {Nummulites} of the European localities.</p>

				<title>Role of dynamics in the advection of aerosols over the Arabian Sea along the west coast of peninsular India during pre-monsoon season: A case study based on satellite data and regional climate model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0269-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The circulation dynamics of an event marked by the formation of an aerosol cluster off the coast of Maharashtra on April 22, 2006, its southward migration along the Indian west coast with a mean speed of $\sim 200$ km/day and its final dissipation after reaching the end of the peninsula by April 28, 2006 as revealed by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) against the pre-monsoon conditions of April 2006 are examined in this study. The maximum aerosol concentration in the cluster was found getting confined to lower and lower altitudes during its southward movement. The NCEP/NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis wind field indicates that the atmospheric circulation, especially the horizontal wind convergence is the major factor that guides the formation and the dynamics of the cluster. Fine mode fraction from MODIS suggests that the cluster mainly consists of coarse dust particles. The regional climate model, RegCM3 with an efficient dust generation module simulates the formation and movement of the cluster appreciably well. The simulations which also exhibit the altitudinally descending nature of the cluster during its southward movement confirm the mechanism which governs the cluster dynamics suggested based on MODIS and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric ultrafine aerosol number concentration and its correlation with vehicular flow at two sites in the western Himalayan region: Kullu-Manali, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0281-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concentration of ultrafine aerosol particles of aitken and nucleation mode having size in the range of 1â20 nm was monitored with water-based Condensation Particle Counter. The monitoring was carried out from midnight-to-midnight in every alternate day on a fortnightly basis to represent summer, monsoon and winter (autumn) seasons of 2008 at Mohal (1154 m amsl) and Kothi (2530 m amsl) in Kullu-Manali area of the northwestern Himalayan region of India. The results indicate that diurnal pattern has faint bimodal structure with two peaks, one in morning and the other in evening at both the sites but it is not as distinct as found in plains. There is rather a constant particle density pattern of large magnitude consistent with vehicular movement from morning till evening. The monthly 24 h average particle density gradually picks up from January, increases rapidly in summer months and then decreases in monsoon season at Mohal but at Kothi it keeps on rising from April to October with a slight more increase in September. The particle density is more in summer than in monsoon season at Mohal, a trend opposite to plains. It may be due to the development of warm thermal layer on valley floor while a cold layer develops along snowy hilltops in winter leading to convection of fine particle up the slopes of valley during daytime. At Kothi, the trend is same as it is in continental plains but opposite to Mohal. The relatively more value of particle density in September and October at both the sites may be due to month long International Kullu Dussehra fair in the valley. The vehicular survey conducted agrees well with entire study period averaged diurnal variations and monthly 24 h averaged value of fine particle density. The average value of ultrafine particle density at each hour of a day for entire study period is $20369 \pm 1230 Ncm^{â3}$ and $14389\pm 1464 Ncm^{â3}$ at Mohal and Kothi sites, respectively. The comparison with earlier results shows a significant increase indicating impact of vehicular onslaught on pure air of this hilly region.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A critical analysis has been made on the long-term yearly and seasonal variations of ozone concentration at Varanasi ($25^\circ N, 83^\circ E$), India and Halley Bay ($76^\circ S, 27^\circ W$), a British Antarctic Service Station. The effect of $O_3$ depletion on night airglow emission of Li 6708 ËA line at Varanasi and Halley Bay has been studied. Calculations based on chemical kinetics show that the airglow intensity of Li 6708 ËA line has also been affected due to the depletion of $O_3$ concentration. The yearly variations and seasonal variations of intensities of Li 6708 ËA line for the above two stations are shown and compared. It has been shown that the rate of decrease of intensity of Li 6708 ËA line was comparatively more at Halley Bay due to dramatic decrease of Antarctic $O_3$ concentration.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Features of the equatorial electrojet are studied at Sao Luiz ($2.6^\circ S, 44.2^\circ W$, inclination $â0.25^\circ $) in eastern Brazil and Sikasso ($11.3^\circ N, 5.7^\circ W$, inclination $0.1^\circ $) in the western African sector. The stations are situated on either side of the lowest magnetic field intensity in the region of rapid changes in the declination. The daily variations of $\Delta \textit {X}$ at the two stations are almost similar with the peak around noon with maximum values during equinoxes and minimum values during J-solstices. Daily variations of $\Delta \textit {Y}$ differ with the maximum deviation of about â35 nT around noon at Sao Luiz and much smaller value of about â10 nT around 14 h LT for Sikasso. The direction of the \textit {H} vector varies from $15^\circ W$ of north at 08 h to more than $30^\circ W$ of north at 17 h for Sao Luiz and from $14^\circ E$ of north to $25^\circ W$ of north at 18 h for Sikasso. The plot of the deviations in $\Delta \textit {X}$ and $\Delta \textit {Y}$ at different hours for the two stations shows the points along narrow ellipses with major axis aligned along $22^\circ W$ of north for Sao Luiz and along $3^\circ W$ of north for Sikasso as compared to declination of $20^\circ W$ for Sao Luiz and $6^\circ W$ for Sikasso. The deviations in $\Delta \textit {X}$ at the two stations are fairly well correlated.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric stability index using radio occultation refractivity profiles</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0311-0319</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new stability index based on atmospheric refractivity at $\sim 500$ hPa level and surface measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity is formulated. The new index named here as refractivity based lifted index (RLI) is designed to give similar results as traditionally used lifted index derived from radiosonde profiles of temperature, pressure and humidity. The formulation of the stability index and its comparison with the traditional temperature profile based lifted index (LI) is discussed. The index is tested on COSMIC radio occultation derived refractivity profiles over Indian region. The forecast potential of the new index for rainfall on $2^\circ \times 2^\circ $ latitudeâlongitude spatial scale with lead time of 3â24 hours indicate that the refractivity based lifted index works better than the traditional temperature based lifted index for the Indian monsoon region. Decreasing values of RLI tend to give increasing rainfall probabilities.</p>

				<title>Spectral characterization of soil and coal contamination on snow reflectance using hyperspectral analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0321-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Snow is a highly reflecting object found naturally on the Earth and its albedo is highly influenced by the amount and type of contamination. In the present study, two major types of contaminants (soil and coal) have been used to understand their effects on snow reflectance in the Himalayan region. These contaminants were used in two categories quantitatively â addition in large quantity and addition in small quantity. Snow reflectance data were collected between 350 and 2500 nm spectral ranges and binned at 10 nm interval by averaging. The experiment was designed to gather the field information in controlled conditions, and radiometric observations were collected. First derivative, band absorption depth, asymmetry, percentage change in reflectance and albedo in optical region were selected to identify and discriminate the type of contamination. Band absorption depth has shown a subtle increasing pattern for soil contamination, however, it was significant for small amounts of coal contamination. The absorption peak asymmetry was not significant for soil contamination but showed a nature towards left asymmetry for coal. The width of absorption feature at 1025 nm was not significant for both the contaminations. The percentage change in reflectance was quite high for small amount of coal contamination rather than soil contamination, however, a shift of peak was observed in soil-contaminated snow which was not present in coal contamination. The albedo drops exponentially for coal contamination rather than soil contamination.</p>

				<title>Study of inter-annual variations in surface melting over Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica, using space-borne scatterometer data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0329-0336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The widespread retreat of glaciers can be considered as a response to the climate change. Being the largest retreating glacierâice shelf system in East Antarctica, the Amery Ice ShelfâLambert Glacier system plays an important role in contributing to sea level rise as well as the surrounding environment and climate. The present study is focused on the investigation of surface melting over the ice shelf using QuikSCAT Ku-band scatterometer data for more than 100 months covering the period from January 2000 to July 2009. The corresponding weather data of Davis Station was obtained from the website of Australian Antarctic Division. Very prominent dips in the backscatter observed in the month of January form a distinct signature caused by physical process of significant melting of the ice/snow surface. The steep increase again in February is attributed to the initiation of the freezing phenomenon. The  derived melting index compared well with the passive microwave-based melting index derived by other researchers. A strong relationship was found between the scatterometer-derived melting index and the cumulative monthly mean air temperature. The highest melting was observed in the summer (January) of 2004, and thereafter gradual cooling appeared to take place in the subsequent years. The snow pack thickness, inferred from the backscatter variations, was found to be higher during winters (June) of 2004 and 2005, compared with other years.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric correction for sea surface temperature retrieval from single thermal channel radiometer data onboard Kalpana satellite</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0337-0345</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An atmospheric correction method has been applied on sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval algorithm using Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) single window channel radiance data onboard Kalpana satellite (K-SAT). The technique makes use of concurrent water vapour fields available from Microwave Imager onboard Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM/TMI) satellite. Total water vapour content and satellite zenith angle dependent SST retrieval algorithm has been developed using Radiative Transfer Model [MODTRAN ver3.0] simulations for Kalpana 10.5â12.5 $\mu $m thermal window channel. Retrieval of Kalpana SST (K-SST) has been carried out for every half-hourly acquisition of Kalpana data for the year 2008 to cover whole annual cycle of SST over Indian Ocean (IO). Validation of the retrieved corrected SST has been carried out using near-simultaneous observations of ship and buoys datasets covering Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and IO regions. A significant improvement in Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of K-SST with respect to buoy (1.50â1.02 K) and to ship datasets (1.41â1.19 K) is seen with the use of near real-time water vapour fields of TMI. Furthermore, comparison of the retrieved SST has also been carried out using near simultaneous observations of TRMM/TMI SST over IO regions. The analysis shows that K-SST has overall cold bias of 1.17 K and an RMSD of 1.09 K after bias correction.</p>

				<title>Volatile properties of atmospheric aerosols during nucleation events at Pune, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0347-0357</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Continuous measurements of aerosol size distributions in the mid-point diameter range 20.5â500 nm were made from October 2005 to March 2006 at Pune ($18^\circ 32^\prime N, 73^\circ 51^\prime E$), India using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). Volatilities of atmospheric aerosols were also measured at $40^\circ , 125^\circ , 175^\circ , 300^\circ $ and $350^\circ C$ temperatures with ThermodenuderâSMPS coupled system to determine aerosol volatile fractions. Aerosols in nucleated, CCN and accumulated modes are characterized from the measured percentage of particles volatized at $40^\circ , 125^\circ , 175^\circ , 300^\circ $ and $350^\circ C$ temperatures. Averaged monthly aerosol concentration is at its maximum in November and gradually decreases to its minimum at the end of March. The diurnal variations of aerosol concentrations gradually decrease in the night and in early morning hours (0400â0800 hr). However, concentration attains minimum in its variations in the noon (1400â1600 hr) due to higher ventilation factor (product of mixing height and wind speed). The half an hour averaged diurnal variation of aerosol number concentration shows about 5 to 10-fold increase despite the ventilation factor at higher side before 1200 hr. This sudden increase in aerosol concentrations is linked with prevailing conditions for nucleation bursts. The measurement of volatile fraction of ambient aerosols reveals that there are large number of highly volatile particles in the Aitken mode in the morning hours and these volatile fractions of aerosols at temperatures &mt; $150^\circ C$ are of ammonium chloride and ammonium sulfate, acetic and formic acids.</p>

				<page>0359-0373</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The occurrence of exceptionally heavy rainfall events and associated flash floods in many areas during recent years motivate us to study long-term changes in extreme rainfall over India. The analysis of the frequency of rainy days, rain days and heavy rainfall days as well as one-day extreme rainfall and return period has been carried out in this study to observe the impact of climate change on extreme rainfall events and flood risk in India. The frequency of heavy rainfall events are decreasing in major parts of central and north India while they are increasing in peninsular, east and north east India. The study tries to bring out some of the interesting findings which are very useful for hydrological planning and disaster managements. Extreme rainfall and flood risk are increasing significantly in the country except some parts of central India.</p>

				<title>Uncertainties in downscaled relative humidity for a semi-arid region in India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0375-0386</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Monthly scenarios of relative humidity (\textit {R}_H) were obtained for the Malaprabha river basin in India using a statistical downscaling technique. Large-scale atmospheric variables (air temperature and specific humidity at 925 mb, surface air temperature and latent heat flux) were chosen as predictors. The predictor variables are extracted from the (1) National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis dataset for the period 1978â2000, and (2) simulations of the third generation Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model for the period 1978â2100. The objective of this study was to investigate the uncertainties in regional scenarios developed for RH due to the choice of emission scenarios (A1B, A2, B1 and COMMIT) and the predictors selected. Multi-linear regression with stepwise screening is the downscaling technique used in this study. To study the uncertainty in the regional scenarios of \textit {R}_H, due to the selected predictors, eight sets of predictors were chosen and a downscaling model was developed for each set. Performance of the downscaling models in the baseline period (1978â2000) was studied using three measures (1) NashâSutcliffe error estimate (\textit {E}_f ), (2) mean absolute error (MAE), and (3) product moment correlation (\textit {P}). Results show that the performances vary between 0.59 and 0.68, 0.42 and 0.50 and 0.77 and 0.82 for \textit {E}_f , MAE and P. Cumulative distribution functions were prepared from the regional scenarios of \textit {R}_H developed for combinations of predictors and emission scenarios. Results show a variation of 1 to 6% \textit {R}_H in the scenarios developed for combination of predictor sets for baseline period. For a future period (2001â2100), a variation of 6 to 15% \textit {R}_H was observed for the combination of emission scenarios and predictors. The variation was highest for A2 scenario and least for COMMIT and B1 scenario.</p>

				<title>Modelling soil moisture under different land covers in a sub-humid environment of Western Ghats, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0387-0398</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of this study is to apply and test a simple parametric water balance model for prediction of soil moisture regime in the presence of vegetation. The intention was to evaluate the differences in model parameterization and performance when applied to small watersheds under three different types of land covers (\textit {Acacia}, degraded forest and natural forest). The watersheds selected for this purpose are located in the sub-humid climate within the Western Ghats, Karnataka, India. Model calibration and validation were performed using a dataset comprising depth-averaged soil moisture content measurements made at weekly time steps from October 2004 to December 2008. In addition to this, a sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to the water-holding capacity of the soils with the aim of explaining the suitability and adaptation of exotic vegetation types under the prevailing climatic conditions. Results indicated reasonably good performance of the model in simulating the pattern and magnitude of weekly average soil moisture content in 150 cm deep soil layer under all three land covers. This study demonstrates that a simple, robust and parametrically parsimonious model is capable of simulating the temporal dynamics of soil moisture content under distinctly different land covers. Also, results of sensitivity analysis revealed that exotic plant species such as \textit {Acacia} have adapted themselves effectively to the local climate.</p>

				<title>Assessing variability of water quality in a groundwater-fed perennial lake of Kashmir Himalayas using linear geostatics</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0399-0411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a study on Manasbal lake, which is one of the high altitude lakes in the KashmirValley, India. Eighteen water samples were analysed for major ions and trace elements to assess the variability of water quality of the lake for various purposes. Geostatistics, the theory of regionalized variables, was then used to enhance the dataset and estimate some missing spatial values. Resultsindicated that the concentration of major ions in the water samples in winter was higher than in summer. The scatter diagrams suggested the dominance of alkaline earths over the alkali elements. Three types of water were identified in the lake that are referred to as $CaâHCO_{3}, MgâHCO_{3}$ and hybrid types. The lake water was found to be controlled by rockâwater interaction with carbonate lithology as a dominant source of the solutes. The major ($Ca^{2+}, Mg^{2+}, Na^{+}, K^{+}, NO_{3}$ and $HCO^{â}_{3} , CO_{3}$ and Cl) and trace elements of the lake water were within the World Health Organization standards, therefore the lake water was considered chemically safe for drinking purposes. Although $NO_3$ concentration (ranging from 1.72 to 2 mg/L), is within the permissible limit and not very alarming, the gradually increasing trend is not acceptable. It is however, important to guard its spatio-temporal variability as the water is used for domestic as well as agricultural purposes. This study is significant as hydrogeological information on such high altitude lakes in India is scanty.</p>

				<title>Application and evaluation of universal kriging for optimal contouring of groundwater levels</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0413-0422</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with the application of universal kriging to interpolate water table elevations from their measurements at random locations. Geographic information system tools were used to generate the continuous surface of water table elevations for the Carlsbad area alluvial aquifer located to the southeast of New Mexico, USA.Water table elevations in the 38 monitoring wells that are common to 1996 and 2003 irrigation years follows normal distribution. A generalized MATLAB^Â® code was developed to generate omni-directional and directional semi-variograms (at $22.5^\circ $ intervals). Low-order polynomials were used to model the trend as the water table profile exhibits a south-east gradient. Different theoretical semivariogram models were tried to select the base semi-variogram for performing geostatistical interpolation. The contour maps of water table elevations exhibit significant decrease in the water table from 1996 to 2003. Statistical analysis performed on the estimated contours revealed that the decrease in water table is between 0.6 and 4.5 m at 90% confidence. The estimation variance contours show that the error in estimation was more than 8 $m^2$ in the west and south-west portions of the aquifer due to the absence of monitoring wells.</p>

				<title>Geospatial tools for assessing land degradation in Budgam district, Kashmir Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0423-0433</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Land degradation reduces the ability of the land to perform many biophysical and chemical functions. The main aim of this study was to determine the status of land degradation in the Budgam area of Kashmir Himalaya using remote sensing and geographic information system. The satellite data together with other geospatial datasets were used to quantify different categories of land degradation. The results were validated in the field and an accuracy of 85% was observed. Land use/land cover of the study area was determined in order to know the effect of land use on the rate of land degradation. Normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and slope of the area were determined using LANDSAT-enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) data, advanced space-borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer, and digital elevation model along with other secondary data were analysed to create various thematic maps, viz., land use/land cover, geology, NDVI and slopes used in modelling land degradation in the Kashmir Himalayan region. The vegetation condition, elevation and land use/land cover information of the area were integrated to assess the land degradation scenario in the area using the ArcGIS âSpatial Analyst Moduleâ. The results reveal that about 13.19% of the study area has undergone moderate to high degradation, whereas about 44.12% of the area has undergone slight degradation.</p>

				<title>Threat of land subsidence in and around Kolkata City and East Kolkata Wetlands, West Bengal, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0435-0446</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper attempts to estimate the possible rate of land subsidence of Kolkata City including Salt Lake City and the adjoining East Kolkata Wetlands located at the lower part of the deltaic alluvial plain of South Bengal basin. Demand of groundwater for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes has increased due to rapid urbanization. The subsurface geology consists of Quaternary sediments comprising a succession of clay, silty clay and sand of various grades. Groundwater occurs mostly under confined condition except in those places where the top aquitard has been obliterated due to the scouring action of past channels. Currently, the piezometric head shows a falling trend and it may be accelerated due to further over-withdrawal of groundwater resulting in land subsidence. The estimated mean land subsidence rate is 13.53 mm/year and for 1 m drop in the piezometric head, the mean subsidence is 3.28 cm. The surface expression of the estimated land subsidence is however, cryptic because of a time lag between the settlement of the thick low-permeable aquitard at the top and its surface expression. Therefore, groundwater of the cities and wetland areas should be developed cautiously based on the groundwater potential to minimize the threat of land subsidence.</p>

				<title>Elastic thickness estimates at north east passive margin of North America and its implications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0447-0458</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Global estimates of the elastic thickness (Te) of the structure of passive continental margins show wide and varying results owing to the use of different methodologies. Earlier estimates of the elastic thickness of the North Atlantic passive continental margins that used flexural modelling yielded a Te value of $\sim 20â100$ km. Here, we compare these estimates with the Te value obtained using orthonormalized Hermite multitaper recovered isostatic coherence functions. We discuss how Te is correlated with heat flow distribution and depth of necking. The EâW segment in the southern study region comprising Nova Scotia and the Southern Grand Banks show low Te values, while the zones comprising the NEâSW zones, viz., Western Greenland, Labrador, Orphan Basin and the Northern Grand Bank show comparatively high Te values. As expected, Te broadly reflects the depth of the $200â400^\circ C$ isotherm below the weak surface sediment layer at the time of loading, and at the margins most of the loading occurred during rifting. We infer that these low Te measurements indicate Te frozen into the lithosphere. This could be due to the passive nature of the margin when the loads were emplaced during the continental break-up process at high temperature gradients.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry and petrogenesis of Neoproterozoic Mylliem granitoids, Meghalaya Plateau, northeastern India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0459-0473</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Mylliem granitoids of the Meghalaya Plateau, northeastern India, represent one of the disharmonic Neoproterozoic igneous plutons, which are intrusive into low-grade Shillong Group of metasediments. Field studies indicate that the Mylliem granitoids cover an area of about 40 $km^2$ and is characterized by development of variable attitude of primary foliations mostly marked along the margin of the pluton. Xenoliths of both Shillong Group of metasediments and mafic rocks have been found to occur within Mylliem granitoids. Structural study of the primary foliation is suggestive of funnel-shaped intrusion of Mylliem granitoids with no appreciable evidence of shearing. Petrographically, Mylliem granitoids are characterized by pink to white phenocrysts of prismatic microcline/perthite and lath-shaped plagioclase ($An_{20}âAn_{29}$). Groundmass material is characterized by quartz, microcline, plagioclase, muscovite and biotite. Sphene and apatite occur as accessory minerals. Petrographically Mylliem granitoids have been discriminated as granite and granodiorite according to IUGS system of classification.</p>
					<p>Critical evaluation of geochemical data and variation trends of major oxides/trace elements suggests a significant role of fractional crystallization in the evolution of Mylliem pluton. Th/U ratios (3.22â6.77) indicate a relatively higher abundance of Th over U. Chondrite-normalized REE diagram characteristically shows an enriched LREE pattern and prominent negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 0.16â0.42) indicating the significant role of plagioclase fractionation from the parent magma. An overall strong REE fractionation pattern has been envisaged for Mylliem granitoids. The strong REE fractionation of the Mylliem granitoids is depicted by (Ce/Yb)_{\textit N} values, which show a range of 1.39 to 1.65. The aluminium saturation index (ASI) (ranging from 1.0 to 1.3), A/CNK ratios (ranging from 1.4 to 2.11) and A/NK ratios (ranging from 1.75 to 2.43) provide evidences for the peraluminous, S-type nature of the Mylliem granitoids. The peraluminous, S-type character is further supported by geochemical parameters such as Fe* and MALI (modified alkali lime index). Normative corundum &lt; 1.0 wt.% is suggestive of the S-type nature of Mylliem granitoids. This is indicative of parent melt-extraction from metasedimentary source rocks by partial melting. Distinct geochemical parameters suggest a post-orogenic tectonic environment for the Mylliem granitoids. The peraluminous, calc-alkalic to alkali-calcic, post-orogenic Mylliem granitoids are geochemically correlatable with the post-orogenic Caledonian granitoids of Ireland and Britain.</p>

				<title>Chemical and sulphur isotope compositions of pyrite in the Jaduguda U (âCuâFe) deposit, Singhbhum shear zone, eastern India: Implications for sulphide mineralization</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0475-0488</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Jaduguda U (âCuâFe) deposit in the Singhbhum shear zone has been the most productive uranium deposit in India. Pyrite occurs as disseminated grains or in sulphide stringers and veins in the ore zone. Veins, both concordant and discordant to the pervasive foliation, are mineralogically either simple comprising pyrite $\pm $ chalcopyrite or complex comprising pyrite + chalcopyrite + pentlandite + millerite. Nickel-sulphide minerals, though fairly common in concordant veins, are very rare in the discordant veins. Pyrite in Ni-sulphide association is commonly replaced by pentlandite at the grain boundary or along micro-cracks.</p>
					<p>Based on concentrations of Co and Ni, pyrite is classified as: type-A -- high Co (up to 30800 ppm), no/low Ni; type-B -- moderate Co (up to 16500 ppm) and moderate to high Ni (up to 32700 ppm); type-C -- no/low Co and high Ni (up to 43000 ppm); type-D -- neither Co nor Ni. Textural and compositional data of pyrites suggest that the hydrothermal fluid responsible for pre-/early-shearing mineralization evolved from Co-rich to Ni-rich and the late-/post-shearing fluid was largely depleted in minor elements. Sulphur isotope compositions of pyrite mostly furnish positive values ranging between --0.33 and 12.06%. Composite samples of pyrites with only type-A compositions and mixed samples of type-A and type-B are consistently positive. However, pyrite with mixed type-A and type-C and pyrite with type-D compositions have negative values but close to 0. By integrating minor element and sulphur isotope compositions of pyrite in conjunction with other published data on the Jaduguda deposit, it is proposed that reduced sulphur for the precipitation of most pyrites (type-A, type-B) was likely derived from isotopically heavy modified seawater. However, some later sulphur might be magmatic in origin remobilized from existing sulphides in the mafic volcanic rocks in the shear zone.</p>

				<title>Petrography, geochemistry and regional significance of crystalline klippen in the Garhwal Lesser Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0489-0501</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Uphalda gneisses (UG) is a crystalline klippe located near Srinagar in Garhwal Himalaya. These gneisses are compared with Debguru porphyroids (DP) ($\approx $ Ramgarh group) of GarhwalâKumaun Himalaya and Baragaon mylonitic gneisses (BMG) of Himachal Himalaya. Petrographic study reveals that the deformation of UG was initiated at higher temperature (above $350^\circ C$) and continued till lowering of temperature and deformation led to the mylonitization.</p>
					<p>Geochemically, these granitic gneisses (UG, DP and BMG) exhibit similar composition. Features such as high molecular A/CNK value (&lt; 1), presence of normative corundum and absence of normative diopside, enhanced Rb/Sr, Rb/Zr ratios, enrichment of Th and containing rounded zircons support their crustally-derived S-type granitic nature. The linear plot in major oxides is interpreted in terms of fractional crystallization processes. Mantle normalized multi-element spider diagram of UG illustrates depletion of Ba, Nb, Sr, P and Ti and enrichment of Th and show similarities with DP and BMG.</p>
					<p>Similarities were observed in lithology, petrographic characters and chemical composition of UG, DP, BMG and Ulleri augen gneisses (Nepal). Comparison with the rocks of Higher Himalayan crystallines ($\approx $Vaikrita), suggests that these rocks (UG) are not transported from Higher Himalaya as understood earlier. This study however proposes that, these gneissic bodies represent an older basement occurring as a tectonic sliver which emplaced within the cover sequence as wedges at different structural levels. This is a regional phenomena observed throughout the Lesser Himalayan region.</p>

				<title>Methods for determination of the age of Pleistocene tephra, derived from eruption of Toba, in central India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0503-0530</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tephra, emplaced as a result of Pleistocene eruption of the Indonesian âsupervolcanoâ Toba, occurs at many localities in India. However, the ages of these deposits have hitherto been contentious; some workers have argued that these deposits mark the most recent eruption (eruption A, ca 75 ka), although at some sites they are stratigraphically associated with Acheulian (Lower Palaeolithic) artefacts. Careful examination of the geochemical composition of the tephras, which are composed predominantly of shards of rhyolitic glass, indicates that discrimination between the products of eruption A and eruption D (ca 790 ka) of Toba is difficult. Nonetheless, this comparison favours eruption D as the source of the tephra deposits at some sites in India, supporting the long-held view that the Lower Palaeolithic of India spans the late Early Pleistocene. In principle, these tephra deposits should be dateable using the KâAr system; however, previous experience indicates contamination by a small proportion of ancient material, resulting in apparent ages that exceed the true ages of the tephras. We have established the optimum size-fraction in which the material from Toba is concentrated, 53â61 $\mu $m, and have considered possible origins for the observed contamination. We also demonstrate that ArâAr analysis of four out of five of our samples has yielded material with an apparent age similar to that expected for eruption D. These numerical ages, of $809 \pm 51, 714 \pm 62, 797 \pm 45$ and $827 \pm 39$ ka for the tephras at Morgaon, Bori, Gandhigram and Simbhora, provide a weighted mean age for this eruption of $799 \pm 24 ka$ (plus-or-minus two standard deviations). However, these numerical ages are each derived from no more than 10â20% of the argon release in each sample, which is not ideal. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that it is feasible, in principle, to date this difficult material using the ArâAr technique; future follow-up studies will therefore be able to refine our preparation and analysis procedures to better optimize the dating.</p>

				<title>Paleochannel and paleohydrology of a Middle Siwalik (Pliocene) fluvial system, northern India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0531-0543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Late Cenozoic fresh water molasses sediments (+6000 m thick) deposited all along the length of the Himalayan fore deep, form the Siwalik Supergroup. This paper reports the results of the paleodrainage and paleohydrology of the Middle Siwalik subgroup of rocks, deposited in non-marine basins adjacent to a rising mountain chain during Pliocene. Well-exposed sections of these rocks have provided adequate paleodrainage data for the reconstruction of paleochannel morphology and paleohydrological attributes of the Pliocene fluvial system.</p>
					<p>Cross-bedding data has been used as inputs to estimate bankfull channel depth and channel sinuosity of Pliocene rivers. Various empirical relationships of modern rivers were used to estimate other paleohydrological attributes such as channel width, sediment load parameter, annual discharge, and channel slope and flow velocity. Computed channel depth, channel slope and flow velocity are supported independently by recorded data of scour depth, cross-bedding variability and Chezyâs equation.</p>
					<p>The estimates indicate that the Middle Siwalik sequence corresponds to a system of rivers, whose individual channels were about 400 m wide and 5.2â7.3 m deep; the river on an average had a low sinuous channel and flowed over a depositional surface sloping at the rate of 53 cm/km. The 700-km long Middle Siwalik (Pliocene) river drained an area of 42925 $km^2$ to the northânortheast, with a flow velocity of 164â284 cm/s, as it flowed generally southâsouthwest of the Himalayan Orogen. Bed-load was about 15% of the total load of this river, whose annual discharge was about 346â1170 $m^{3}/s$ normally and rose to approximately 1854 $m^{3}/s$ during periodic floods. The Froude number of 0.22 suggests that the water flows in the Pliocene river channels were tranquil, which in turn account for the profuse development of cross-bedded units in the sandstone. The estimated paleochannel parameters, bedding characteristics and the abundance of coarse clastics in the lithic fill are rather similar to the modern braided rivers of Canada and India such as South Saskatchewan and Gomti, respectively.</p>

				<title>Fine-scale responses of phytoplankton to freshwater influx in a tropical monsoonal estuary following the onset of southwest monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0545-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In May of 2007, a study was initiated by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, India, to investigate the influence of monsoonal rainfall on hydrographic conditions in the Mandovi River of India. The study was undertaken at a location $\sim 2$ km upstream of the mouth of this estuary. During the premonsoon (PreM) in May, when circulation in the estuary was dominated by tidal activity, phytoplankton communities in the high saline (35â37 psu) waters at the study site were largely made up of the coastal neritic species \textit {Fragilaria oceanica, Ditylum brightwellii} and \textit {Trichodesmium erythraeum}. During the later part of the intermonsoon (InterM) phase, an abrupt decline in salinity led to a surge in phytoplankton biomass (Chlorophyll \textit {a} $\sim 14 mg m^{â3}$), of a population that was dominated by \textit {Thalassiosira eccentricus}. As the southwest monsoon (SWM) progressed and the estuary freshened salinity and Chlorophyll \textit {a} (Chl \textit {a}) concentrations decreased during the MoN, \textit {Skeletonema costatum} established itself as the dominant form. Despite the low biomass (Chl \textit {a} &mt; 2 mg $m^{â3}$), the phytoplankton community of the MoN was the most diverse of the entire study. During the postmonsoon (PostM), the increase in salinity was marked by a surge in dinoflagellate populations comprising of \textit {Ceratium furca, Akashiwo sanguinea}, and \textit {Pyrophacus horologium}.</p>

				<title>Modelling the response of an alluvial aquifer to anthropogenic and recharge stresses in the United States Southern Great Plains</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0557-0572</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper uses Visual MODFLOW to simulate potential impacts of anthropogenic pumping and recharge variability on an alluvial aquifer in semi-arid northwestern Oklahoma. Groundwater withdrawal from the aquifer is projected to increase by more than 50% (relative to 1990) by the year 2050. In contrast, climate projections indicate declining regional precipitation over the next several decades, creating a potential problem of demand and supply. The following scenarios were simulated: (1) projected groundwater withdrawal, (2) a severe drought, (3) a prolonged wet period, and (4) a human adjustment scenario, which assumes future improvements in water conservation measures. Results indicate that the combined impacts of anthropogenic pumping and droughts would create drawdown of greater than 12 m in the aquifer. Spatially, however, areas of severe drawdown will be localized around large-capacity well clusters. The worst impacts of both pumping and droughts will be on streamâaquifer interaction. For example, the projected aquifer pumpage would lead to a total streamflow loss of 40%, creating losing stream system regionally. Similarly, a severe drought would lead to a total streamflow loss of &lt; 80%. A post-audit of the model was also carried out to evaluate model performance. By simulating various stress scenarios on the alluvial aquifer, this study provides important information for evaluating management options for alluvial aquifers.</p>

				<title>Determining the optimum cell size of digital elevation model for hydrologic application</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0573-0582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Scale is one of the most important but unsolved issues in various scientific disciplines that deal with spatial data. The arbitrary choice of grid cell size for contour interpolated digital elevation models (DEM) is one of the major sources of uncertainty in the hydrologic modelling process. In this paper, an attempt was made to identify methods for determining an optimum cell size for a contour interpolated DEM in prior to hydrologic modelling. Twenty-meter interval contour lines were used to generate DEMs of five different resolutions, \textit {viz}., 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 m using TOPOGRID algorithm. The obtained DEMs were explored for their intrinsic quality using four different methods, i.e., sink analysis, fractal dimension of derived stream network, entropy measurement and semivariogram modelling. These methods were applied to determine the level artifacts (interpolation error) in DEM surface as well as derived stream network, spatial information content and spatial variability respectively. The results indicated that a 90 m cell size is sufficient to capture the terrain variability for subsequent hydrologic modelling in the study area. The significance of this research work is that it provides methods which DEM users can apply to select an appropriate DEM cell size in prior to detailed hydrologic modelling.</p>

				<title>Modelling spatial anisotropy of gold concentration data using GIS-based interpolated maps and variogram analysis: Implications for structural control of mineralization</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0583-0593</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Linear trends of anomalously high gold values in the Florida Canyon gold deposit, Nevada have been identified using a combination of contour maps of gold (Au) concentration developed with a geographic information system (GIS) and variogram maps created using a geostatistical analysis package. These linear trends are interpreted to represent major fault zones that exerted a prinicipal control on gold mineralization and therefore imparted a spatial anisotropy to gold concentrations.</p>
					<p>Oxidation state information such as oxide, sulfide or mixed was used initially to map and contour the lower limit of the oxidation zone. Linear trends on this surface suggest the location and trend of major structural elements in the deposit that guided late oxidizing fluids. Subsequently, four contour maps of gold concentrations in oxidized rocks were produced, each map representing 500 ft vertical intervals starting at 3500 ft above mean sea level (msl). Relatively high concentrations of Au that form linear trends on these maps suggest the presence of structural features, such as shear zones that controlled mineralization. Finally, to validate the observed trends, variogram maps of gold concentrations were derived through geostatistical analysis and the major axes of anisotropy were determined for each map.</p>
					<p>The results that emerge suggest linear trends of northeast, northwest and, less prominently, northâ south orientations. The northâsouth and northeast trends match those of known and mapped major structures associated with the Florida Canyon deposit. However, the results imply a stronger control on mineralization by northwest-trending structures than previously recognized and the location of possible structures of all trends not previously mapped. They also serve to identify faults that controlled both early hydrothermal fluids and late oxidizing fluids since the gold distribution represents the time integrated effects of both fluid events.</p>
					<p>The linear trends derived by spatial analysis (contour maps, variogram maps) of geochemical data (i.e., gold concentration), combined with the results of the field observations prove to be advantageous in understanding the structural control of gold mineralization. Such spatial analyses of geochemical concentration data are particularly useful in the field of mineral exploration.</p>

				<title>Efficient two-dimensional magnetotellurics modelling using implicitly restarted Lanczos method</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0595-0604</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents an efficient algorithm, FDA2DMT (Free Decay Analysis for 2D Magnetotellurics (MT)), based on eigenmode approach to solve the relevant partial differential equation, for forward computation of two-dimensional (2D) responses. The main advantage of this approach lies in the fact that only a small subset of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors are required for satisfactory results. This small subset (pre-specified number) of eigenmodes are obtained using shift and invert implementation of Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Method (IRLM). It has been established by experimentation that only 15â20% smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvectors are sufficient to secure the acceptable accuracy. Once the single frequency response is computed using eigenmode approach, the responses for subsequent frequencies can be obtained in negligible time. Experiment design results for validation of FDA2DMT are presented by considering two synthetic models from COMMEMI report, Brewitt-Taylor and Weaver (1976) model and a field data based model from Garhwal Himalaya.</p>

				<title>Development of the negative gravity anomaly of the $85^\circ E$ Ridge, northeastern Indian Ocean â A process oriented modelling approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0605-0615</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The $85^\circ E$ Ridge extends from the Mahanadi Basin, off northeastern margin of India to the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount in the Central Indian Basin. The ridge is associated with two contrasting gravity anomalies: negative anomaly over the north part (up to $5^\circ N$ latitude), where the ridge structure is buried under thick Bengal Fan sediments and positive anomaly over the south part, where the structure is intermittently exposed above the seafloor. Ship-borne gravity and seismic reflection data are modelled using process oriented method and this suggest that the $85^\circ E$ Ridge was emplaced on approximately 10â15 km thick elastic plate (\textit {Te}) and in an off-ridge tectonic setting. We simulated gravity anomalies for different crust-sediment structural configurations of the ridge that were existing at three geological ages, such as Late Cretaceous, Early Miocene and Present. The study shows that the gravity anomaly of the ridge in the north has changed through time from its inception to present. During the Late Cretaceous the ridge was associated with a significant positive anomaly with a compensation generated by a broad flexure of the Moho boundary. By Early Miocene the ridge was approximately covered by the postcollision sediments and led to alteration of the initial gravity anomaly to a small positive anomaly. At present, the ridge is buried by approximately 3 km thick Bengal Fan sediments on its crestal region and about 8 km thick pre- and post-collision sediments on the flanks. This geological setting had changed physical properties of the sediments and led to alter the minor positive gravity anomaly of Early Miocene to the distinct negative gravity anomaly.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0617-0626</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study involves the characterization of pegmatoidal granite, southeast of Beawar, Ajmer district, Rajasthan. Earlier researchers had described this granite as part of the BGC, basement to the Bhim Group of the Delhi Super Group rocks. However, the present study indicates that it is younger than the rocks of Bhim Group of South Delhi Fold Belt, into which it is intrusive. The intrusion is structurally controlled and the outcrop pattern is phacolithic. The granite had intruded post-$D_2$ deformation of the Delhi orogeny along the axial planes of $D_2$ folds. The intrusion has also resulted in the formation of a contact aureole about the calc gneisses.</p>

				<title>Mafic rocks from Erinpura gneiss terrane in the Sirohi region: Possible ocean-floor remnants in the foreland of the Delhi Fold Belt, NW India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0627-0641</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A small isolated mafic body occurs to the south of Sirohi near village Daba within the Neoproterozoic Erinpura Granite in the southern sector of the Proterozoic Delhi Fold Belt in NW India. This mafic body occurs close to a 100 m wide NEâSW trending shear zone (Daba Shear Zone) which overprints the felsic rock fabrics. Further south, a small mafic body near village Kui was also sampled which forms the southern limit of the Phulad Ophiolite Suite which is a 300 km long major NEâSW trending lineament, described as Western Margin Fault. Some of the lithological components of the Daba mafic body show locally preserved magmatic fabric but completely transformed mineralogies under lower amphibolites facies metamorphic conditions where two-stage deformation has been inferred. Magnetic fabric analysis underlines a general correspondence of structural elements in both felsic and mafic lithologies. Binary correlations of Zr with other high field strength elements underline fractionation as the main process in the evolution of Daba and Kui rocks. Geochemical characteristics indicate subalkaline tholeiitic basalt affinity for these mafic rocks. The trace element characteristics, such as enriched LIL elements, high Th, absence of negative Nb anomalies and depletion in compatible elements in Daba samples suggest an enriched mantle source and lower degree of melting. The trace and rare earth element characteristics for Kui (Th anomaly, NbâTa trough and less spiked patterns, flat REE trends) indicate derivation from a refractory mantle source affected by fluids derived from subduction. Distinct differences in trace and REE characteristics between Daba and Kui can be interpreted in terms of different stages of ophiolite development.</p>

				<title>PbâPb zircon ages of Archaean metasediments and gneisses from the Dharwar craton, southern India: Implications for the antiquity of the eastern Dharwar craton</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0643-0661</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>$^{207}Pbâ^{206}Pb$ ages of zircons in samples of metasediments as well as ortho- and para-gneisses from both the western and the eastern parts of the Dharwar craton have been determined using an ion microprobe. Detrital zircons in metasedimentary rocks from both yielded ages ranging from 3.2 to 3.5 Ga. Zircons from orthogneisses from the two parts also yielded similar ages. Imprints of younger events have been discerned in the ages of overgrowths on older zircon cores in samples collected throughout the craton. Our data show that the evolution of the southwestern part of eastern Dharwar craton involved a significant amount of older crust (&lt; 3.0 Ga). This would suggest that crust formation in both the western and eastern parts of the Dharwar craton took place over similar time interval starting in the Mesoarchaean at ca. 3.5 Ga and continuing until 2.5 Ga. Our data coupled with geological features and geodynamic setting of the Dharwar craton tend to suggest that the eastern Dharwar craton and the western Dharwar craton formed part of a single terrane.</p>

					<p>The distributional pattern of various palynotaxa in the coal bearing sediments recovered from six borecores (MLG-23, MLG-24, MLG-28, SGK-2, SGK-3 and SGK-4) in Gundala area of Godavari Graben has suggested occurrence of five distinct palynoassemblages: Palynoassemblage-A marked in borecore MLG-23 shows dominance of monosaccates chiefly \textit {Parasaccites} along with \textit {Plicatipollenites, Caheniasaccites, Divarisaccus}, and \textit {Potonieisporites}, represents Talchir palynoflora; Palynoassemblage-B characterized by dominance of radial monosaccates chiefly \textit {Parasaccites} along with trilete taxa \textit {Callumispora} in borecores MLG-23 and MLG-24, corresponds to Lower Karharbari palynoflora; Palynoassemblage-C distinguished in borecores MLG-24, MLG-28, SGK-2, SGK-3 and SGK-4 is marked by dominance of radial monosaccates mainly \textit {Parasaccites} along with nonstriate disaccate \textit {Scheuringipollenites}, represents Upper Karharbari palynoflora; Palynoassemblage-D in borecores MLG-23, MLG-24 and MLG-28 demarcated by dominance of nonstriate disaccates chiefly \textit {Scheuringipollenites, Ibisporites} along with sub-dominance of few striate disaccates, \textit {viz., Faunipollenites, Striatopodocarpites, Crescentipollenites} and \textit {Striatites} signifies Barakar palynoflora; the youngest, Palynoassemblage-E identified in borecores MLG-24 and MLG-28 shows dominance of striate disaccates, \textit {viz., Striatopodocarpites} and \textit {Faunipollenites} in conjunction with \textit {Strotersporites, Crescentipollenites, Hamiapollenites, Corisaccites, Weylandites} and \textit {Falcisporites}. This palynoassemblage also shows the appearance of some stratigraphically significant palynomorphs, \textit {viz., Lunatisporites, Lundbladispora, Playfordiaspora, Klausipollenites, Kamthisaccites, Guttulapollenites} and \textit {Crustaesporites} symbolizing Late Permian Raniganj palynoflora. Almost a complete palynological succession from Talchir to Raniganj has been demarcated in Lower Gondwana succession of Gundala area.</p>

				<page>0681-0701</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to reconstruct the palaeoclimate, a number of fossil wood pieces were collected and investigated from two new fossil localities situated in the Dhemaji and Lakhimpur districts of Assam. They belong to the Tipam Group considered to be of MiddleâLate Miocene in age and show affinities with \textit {Gluta} (Anacardiaceae), \textit {Bischofia} (Euphorbiaceae), \textit {Bauhinia, Cynometra, Copaifera-Detarium-Sindora, Millettia-Pongamia}, and \textit {Afzelia-Intsia} (Fabaceae). The flora also records a new species of \textit {Bauhinia} named \textit {Bauhinia miocenica} sp. nov. The assemblage indicates a warm and humid climate in the region during the deposition of the sediments. The occurrence of some southeast Asian elements in the fossil flora indicates that an exchange of floral elements took place between India and southeast Asia during the Miocene.</p>

				<title>Carbon isotopic composition of fossil leaves from the Early Cretaceous sediments of western  India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0703-0711</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stable carbon isotope analysis of fossil leaves from the Bhuj Formation, western India was carried out to infer the prevailing environmental conditions. Compression fossil leaves such as \textit {Pachypteris indica, Otozamite kachchhensis, Brachyphyllum royii} and \textit {Dictyozamites} sp. were recovered from three sedimentary successions of the Bhuj Formation, Early Cretaceous in age. A chronology was established based on faunal assemblage and palyno-stratigraphy and further constrained by carbon isotope stratigraphy. The three sampling sites were the Karawadi river bank near Dharesi; the Chawad river bank near Mathal; and the Pur river section near Trambau village in Gujarat. The Dharesi sample was also analyzed to investigate intra-leaf $\delta ^{13}C$ variability. The mean $\delta ^{13}C$ of the leaf was $â24.6 \pm 0.4â°$ which implied negligible systematic change along the leaf axis. The Mathal sample was fragmented in nature and showed considerable variation in carbon isotopic composition. The Trambau sample considered to be the oldest, dating to the middle of Aptian (\textit {ca}. 116 Ma), shows the most depleted value in $\delta ^{13}C$ among all of them. The overall $\delta ^{13}C$ trend ranging from mid Aptian (\textit {ca}. 116 Ma) to early Albian (\textit {ca}. 110 Ma) shows a progressive increase in $\delta ^{13}C$ from â26.8 to â20.5â°. Based on these measurements the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide of the AptianâAlbian period is estimated to be between â7.4 and â1.7â°. The ratio of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in leaf to that of the ambient atmosphere calculated based on a model is estimated to be similar to that of the modern plants. This indicates that the Early-Cretaceous plants adapted to the prevailing high carbon dioxide regime by increasing their photosynthetic uptake.</p>

				<title>Tree-ring variation in teak (\textit {Tectona grandis} L.) from Allapalli, Maharashtra in relation to moisture and Palmer Drought Severity Index, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0713-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We developed a ring-width chronology of teak (\textit {Tectona grandis} L.) from a moisture stressed area in Maharashtra, India. Bootstrapped correlation analysis indicated that moisture index (MI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) showed better performance rather than same year rainfall over the region. Tree-ring variations were most correlated positively with PDSI during different seasons compared with MI. Significant strong positive correlation with MI, and negative association with temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were found during previous and current year post-monsoon (ON). This study shows that the moisture availability during the post-monsoon of the previous year has a significant role in the development of annual growth rings. The reconstructed previous year post-monsoon (âON) moisture index for the period 1866â1996 indicates 3.5 and 29.3 years periodicities.</p>

				<title>Discontinuity surfaces and event stratigraphy of Okha Shell Limestone Member: Implications for Holocene sea level changes, western India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0723-0734</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Okha Shell Limestone Member of Chaya Formation is the coarse grained, shell rich deposit commonly recognized as the beach rocks. It has been age bracketed between Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Late Quaternary sea level changes have been studied with beach rocks along the Saurashtra coastal region. The present study has been carried out in the Okhamandal area of the Saurashtra peninsula especially on the Okha Shell Limestone Member as exposed at various locations along the coast from north to south. Temporal and spatial correlations of the observations have revealed three events in the Okha Shell Limestone Member of Chaya Formation that are correlated laterally. The events show depositional breaks represented by discontinuity surfaces, the taphofacies varieties and ichnological variations. The present study in the context of available geochrnological data of the region suggests a prominent depositional break representing low sea level stand (regression) during an Early Holocene during the deposition of Okha Shell Limestone Member.</p>

				<title>The ionâaerosol interactions from the ion mobility and aerosol particle size distribution measurements on January 17 and February 18, 2005 at Maitri, Antarctica â A case study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0735-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A case study for the ionâaerosol interactions is presented from the simultaneous measurements of mobility spectra of atmospheric ions in the mobility range of 2.29 to $2.98 \times 10^{â4} cm^{2} V^{â1} s^{â1}$ (diameter range 0.41â109 nm) and of size distribution of atmospheric aerosol particles in the size ranges of 4.4â700 nm and 500â20,000 nm diameters made at Maitri ($70^\circ 45^\prime 52^\prime ^\prime S, 11^\circ 44^\prime 2.7^\prime  ^\prime E$; 130 m above mean sea level), Antarctica, on two days January 17 and February 18, 2005, with contrasting meteorological conditions. In contrast to January 17, on February 18, winds were stronger from the morning to noon and lower from the noon to evening, atmospheric pressure was lower, cloudiness was more, the land surface remained snow-covered after a blizzard on February 16 and 17 and the airmass over Maitri, descended from an altitude of $\sim 3$ km after an excursion over ocean. On these days mobility spectra showed two modes, corresponding to intermediate ions and light large ions and an indication of additional one/two maxima for small/cluster ions and heavy large ions. The small ions generated by cosmic rays, and the nucleation mode particles generated probably by photochemical reactions grew in size by condensation of volatile trace gases on them and produced the cluster and intermediate ion modes and the Aitken particle mode in ion/particle spectra. Particles in the size range of 9â26 nm have been estimated to grow at the rate of 1.9 nm $h^{â1}$ on February 18, 2005. Both, ions and aerosol particles show bimodal size distributions in the 16â107 nm size range, and comparison of the two size distributions suggests the formation of multiple charged ions. Attachment of small ions to particles in this bimodal distribution of Aitken particles together with the formation of multiple charged ions are proposed to result in the light and heavy large ion modes. Growth of the nucleation mode particles on February 18, 2005 is associated with the passage of the airmass over ocean. In contrast, though the ion size distributions were not much different, the aerosol size distributions did not show a dominant peak for the formation and growth of nucleation mode particles on January 17. More measurements are needed before the conclusion of this case study is generalized.</p>

				<title>Analysis on MM5 predictions at Sriharikota during northeast monsoon 2008</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0755-0771</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian northeast monsoon is inherently chaotic in nature as the rainfall realised in the peninsular India depends substantially on the formation and movement of low-pressure systems in central and southwest Bay of Bengal and on the convective activity which is mainly due to the moist north-easterlies from Bay of Bengal. The objective of this study is to analyse the performance of the PSU-NCAR Mesoscale Model Version 5 (MM5), for northeast monsoon 2008 that includes tropical cyclones â Rashmi, Khai-Muk and Nisha and convective events over Sriharikota region, the rocket launch centre. The impact of objective analysis system using radiosonde observations, surface observations and Kalpana-1 satellite derived Atmospheric Motion Wind Vectors (AMV) is also studied. The performance of the model is analysed by comparing the predicted parameters like mean sea level pressure (MSLP), intensity, track and rainfall with the observations. The results show that the model simulations could capture MSLP and intensity of all the cyclones reasonably well. The dependence of the movement of the system on the environmental flow is clearly observed in all the three cases. The vector displacement error and percentage of improvement is calculated to study the impact of objective data analysis on the movement and intensity of the cyclone.</p>

				<title>Meso-scale atmospheric events promote phytoplankton blooms in the coastal Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0773-0782</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Bay of Bengal is considered to be a low productive region compared to the Arabian Sea based on conventional seasonal observations. Such seasonal observations are not representative of a calendar year since the conventional approach might miss episodic high productive events associated with extreme atmospheric processes. We examined here the influence of extreme atmospheric events, such as heavy rainfall and cyclone \textit {Sidr}, on phytoplankton biomass in the western Bay of Bengal using both \textit {in situ} time-series observations and satellite derived Chlorophyll \textit {a} (Chl \textit {a}) and sea surface temperature (SST). Supply of nutrients through the runoff driven by episodic heavy rainfall (234 mm) on 4â5 October 2007 caused an increase in Chl \textit {a} concentration by four times than the previous in the coastal Bay was observed within two weeks. Similar increase in Chl \textit {a}, by 3 to 10 times, was observed on the right side of the cyclone \textit {Sidr} track in the central Bay of Bengal after the cyclone \textit {Sidr}. These two episodic events caused phytoplankton blooms in the western Bay of Bengal which enhanced $\sim 40%$ of fishery production during OctoberâDecember 2007 compared to that in the same period in 2006.</p>

				<title>Anomalous behaviour of the Indian summer monsoon 2009</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0783-0794</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian subcontinent witnessed a severe monsoon drought in the year 2009. India as a whole received 77% of its long period average during summer monsoon season (1 June to 30 September) of 2009, which is the third highest deficient all India monsoon season rainfall year during the period 1901â2009. Therefore, an attempt is made in this paper to study the characteristic features of summer monsoon rainfall of 2009 over the country and to investigate some of the possible causes behind the anomalous behaviour of the monsoon.</p>
					<p>Presence of El Ni$\tilde{n} $o like conditions in the Pacific and warming over the equatorial Indian Ocean altered the circulation patterns and produced an anomalous low level convergence and ascending motion over the Indian Ocean region and large scale subsidence over the Indian landmass. Furthermore, the crossequatorial flow was weak, the monsoon was dominated by the slower 30â60 day mode, and the synoptic systems, which formed over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, did not move inland. All the above features resulted in less moisture supply over the Indian landmass, resulting in subdued rainfall activity leading to a severe monsoon drought during 2009.</p>

				<title>Multi-model ensemble schemes for predicting northeast monsoon rainfall over peninsular India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0795-0805</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The northeast (NE) monsoon season (October, November and December) is the major period of rainfall activity over south peninsular India. This study is mainly focused on the prediction of northeast monsoon rainfall using lead-1 products (forecasts for the season issued in beginning of September) of seven general circulation models (GCMs). An examination of the performances of these GCMs during hindcast runs (1982â2008) indicates that these models are not able to simulate the observed interannual variability of rainfall. Inaccurate response of the models to sea surface temperatures may be one of the probable reasons for the poor performance of these models to predict seasonal mean rainfall anomalies over the study domain. An attempt has been made to improve the accuracy of predicted rainfall using three different multi-model ensemble (MME) schemes, \textit {viz}., simple arithmetic mean of models (EM), principal component regression (PCR) and singular value decomposition based multiple linear regressions (SVD). It is found out that among these three schemes, SVD based MME has more skill than other MME schemes as well as member models.</p>

				<title>Long-term variations in outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR), convective available potential energy (CAPE) and temperature in the tropopause region over India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0807-0823</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relationship of outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) with convective available potential energy (CAPE) and temperature at the 100-hPa pressure level is examined using daily radiosonde data for a period 1980â2006 over Delhi ($28.3^\circ N, 77.1^\circ E$) and Kolkata ($22.3^\circ N, 88.2^\circ E$), and during 1989â2005 over Cochin ($10^\circ N, 77^\circ E$) and Trivandrum ($8.5^\circ N, 77.0^\circ E$), India. Correlation coefficient (\textit {R_xy}) between monthly OLR and CAPE shows a significant ($\sim â0.45$) anti-correlation at Delhi and Kolkata suggesting low OLR associated with high convective activity during summer (seasonal variation). Though, no significant correlation was found between OLR and CAPE at Cochin and Trivandrum (low latitude region); analysis of OLR and temperature (at 100-hPa) association suggests that low OLR peaks appear corresponding to low temperature at Delhi (\textit {R_xy} $\sim 0.30$) and Kolkata (\textit {R_xy} $\sim 0.25$) during summer. However, \textit {R_xy} between OLR and temperature becomes opposite as we move towards low latitudes ($\sim 8^\circ â10^\circ N$) due to strong solar cycle influence. Large scale components mainly ENSO and quasi-biennial oscillaton (QBO) that contributed to the 100-hPa temperature variability were also analyzed, which showed that ENSO variance is larger by a factor of two in comparison to QBO over Indian region. ENSO warm conditions cause warming at 100-hPa over Delhi and Darwin. However, due to strong QBO and solar signals in the equatorial region, ENSO signal seems less effective. QBO, ENSO, and solar cycle contribution in temperature are found location-dependent (latitudinal variability) responding in consonance with shifting in convective activity regime during El Ni$\tilde{n} $o, seasonal variability in the tropical easterly jet, and the solar irradiance.</p>

				<title>Study of vertical wind profiles in an urban area with complex terrain (Tehran)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0825-0841</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper monthly trends of vertical wind profiles within and above an urban area with complex topography (Tehran) have been investigated using data from a Sodar, a 100-m and two 28-m towers and some surface stations. It includes the occurrence, evolution, dissipation time, peak time and maximum height for katabaticâanabatic winds due to topography, return flow and urban circulation. Vertical distributions of wind and the heat and momentum fluxes up to 600 m were also considered.</p>
					<p>The vertical wind profiles which have diurnal and seasonal variations show southwesterly daily anabatic wind and northeasterly nocturnal katabatic wind. Daily vertical wind profile structure which has two layers and two jets contains a decrease approximately at 300â400 m which may be due to the return flow and a daily thermal convective flow in the urban convergent terrain. At night the nocturnal wind profile structure, in the majority of months, has two layers and sometimes three layers containing northeasterly flows. In two layers structure, a decrease can be seen between two layers. In three layers structure, the middle layer has a different direction that indicates the return flow and urban circulation more clearly. Katabatic flows also develop in successive phases varying from 1 to 3 phases in different months. Investigation on surface wind demonstrates that in cold months a drainage flow from a valley located in the west of the station can affect wind speed and direction especially at evening transition time. These flow patterns can influence the way air pollutants disperse in this area.</p>

				<title>New particle formation by ion-induced nucleation during dissipation stage of thunderstorm</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0843-0850</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A case of new particle formation observed during dissipation stage of a thunderstorm at a tropical station, Pune, India on 3 June 2008 is reported. The flash rate and rainfall intensity increased as high as 110 flashes per 5 minutes and 150 mm $hour^{â1}$ respectively during the active stage of thunderstorm, and then gradually decreased during the dissipation stage. The number concentration of particles in the size range of 10â100 nm sharply increased from 350 particles $cm^{â3} to \sim 8000$ particles $cm^{â3}$ during the dissipation stage of a thunderstorm and grew to larger diameter subsequently. Observations suggest that the atmospheric conditions such as (i) reduced background aerosol concentration after heavy rain, (ii) high humidity condition, and (iii) increased ion concentration during the dissipation stage by corona discharges, favoured generation of new particles by ion-induced nucleation (IIN). Observations also suggest that generation of unipolar ions by corona discharges may be more favourable for IIN and subsequent growth of the particles.</p>

				<title>GPS based TEC measurements for a period August 2008âDecember 2009 near the northern crest of Indian equatorial ionospheric anomaly region</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0851-0858</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, measurements of total electron content (TEC) have gained importance with increasing demand for the GPS-based navigation applications in trans-ionospheric communications. To study the variation in ionospheric TEC, we used the data obtained from GPS Ionospheric Scintillation and TEC monitoring (GISTM) system which is in operation at SVNIT, Surat, India ($21.16^\circ N, 72.78^\circ E$) located at the northern crest of equatorial anomaly region. The data collected (for the low sunspot activity period from August 2008âDecember 2009) were used to study the diurnal, monthly, seasonal semi-annual and annual variations of TEC at Surat. It was observed that the diurnal variation at the region reaches its maximum value between 13:00 and 16:00 IST. The monthly average diurnal variations showed that the TEC maximizes during the equinox months followed by the winter months, and are lowest during the summer months. The ionospheric range delay to TEC for the primary GPS signal is 0.162 m per TECU. The diurnal variation in TEC shows a minimum to maximum variation of about 5 to 50 TECU (in current low sunspot activity periods). These TEC values correspond to range delay variations of about 1 to 9 m at Surat. These variations in the range delay will certainly increase in high sunspot activity periods. Detected TEC variations are also closely related to space weather characterizing quantities such as solar wind and geomagnetic activity indices.</p>

				<title>Impact of GangesâBrahmaputra interannual discharge variations on Bay of Bengal salinity and temperature during 1992â1999 period</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0859-0872</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study investigates the impact of monthly GangesâBrahmaputra river discharge variations on  Bay of Bengal salinity and temperature during the period 1992â1999. The GangesâBrahmaputra river discharge is characterized by a well-defined seasonal cycle with strong interannual variations. The highest/lowest yearly peak discharge occurs in summer 1998/summer 1992, with 1998 value amounting to twice that of 1992. This river discharge is then used to force an ocean general circulation model. Our main result is that the impact of these rivers on the variability of Bay of Bengal sea surface salinity is strong in the northern part, with excess run-off forcing fresh anomalies, and \textit {vice versa}. Most of the years, the influence of the interannual variability of river discharge on the Bay salinity does not extend south of $\sim 10^\circ N$. This stands in contrast with the available observations and is probably linked to the relatively coarse resolution of our model. However, the extreme discharge anomaly of 1998 is exported through the southern boundary of the Bay and penetrates the south-eastern Arabian Sea a few months after the discharge peak. In response to the discharge anomalies, the model simulates significant mixed-layer temperature anomalies in the northern Bay of Bengal. This has the potential to influence the climate of the area. From our conclusions, it appears necessary to use a numerical model with higher resolution (both on the horizontal and vertical) to quantitatively investigate the upper Bay of Bengal salinity structure.</p>

				<title>Subsurface signatures and timing of extreme wave events along the southeast Indian coast</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0873-0883</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Written historyâs limitation becomes apparent when attempting to document the predecessors of extreme coastal events in the Indian Ocean, from 550â700 years in Thailand and 1000 years in Indonesia. Detailed ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys in Mahabalipuram, southeast India, complemented with sedimentological analyses, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and optical dating provide strong evidence of extreme wave events during the past 3700 years. The diagnostic event signatures include the extent and elevation of the deposits, as well as morphologic similarity of buried erosional scarps to those reported in northern Sumatra region. Optical ages immediately overlying the imaged discontinuities that coincides with high concentration of heavy minerals date the erosional events to $340 \pm 35, 350 \pm 20, 490 \pm 30, 880 \pm 40, 1080 \pm 60, 1175 \pm 188, 2193 \pm 266, 2235 \pm 881, 2489 \pm 293, 2450 \pm 130, 2585 \pm 609, 3710 \pm 200 $years ago. These evidences are crucial in reconstructing paleo extreme wave events and will pave the way for regional correlation of erosional horizons along the northern margin of Indian Ocean.</p>

				<title>Environmental magnetic and geochemical characteristics of Chennai coastal sediments, Bay of Bengal, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0885-0895</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, environmental magnetic, heavy metal and statistical analyses were conducted on 21 surface sediments collected from Chennai coast, India, to examine the feasibility of heavy metal pollution using magnetic susceptibility. The Chennai coastal sediment samples are dominated by ferrimagnetic minerals corresponding to magnetite-like minerals. The percentage of frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility reflects the presence of super-paramagnetic/single domain magnetic minerals in Chennai harbour, Cooum and Adayar rivers sediments. High pollution load index in sample E1, E2, CH7, C11, C12 and A16 is mainly due to anthropogenic activities such as, harbour activities, Cooum and Adayar rivers input and industrial effluent. Factor analysis shows that the magnetic concentration dependent parameters ($\chi , \chi_{ARM}$ and SIRM) covary with the heavy metal concentrations, suggesting that the input of magnetic minerals and heavy metals in Chennai coastal sediments are derived from the same anthropogenic sources. Strong correlation obtained between pollution load index (PLI) and concentration dependent parameters ($\chi , \chi_{ARM}$ and SIRM) for the polluted samples with magnetic susceptibility excess of $ 50\times 10^{â8} m^{3}kg^{â1}$. Significant correlations between heavy metals and magnetic susceptibility point out the potential of magnetic screening/monitoring for simple and rapid proxy indicator of heavy metal pollution in marine sediments.</p>

				<title>Significance of saturation index of certain clay minerals in shallow coastal groundwater, in and around Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu, India</title>

				<page>0897-0909</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The saturation index of clay minerals like Gibbsite, Kaolinite, Illite, Montmorillonite and Chlorite in groundwater were studied in detail by collecting 29 groundwater samples from the shallow coastal aquifers in and around Kalpakkam. The samples collected were analysed for major cations, anions and trace elements by using standard procedures. The study reveals that pH has a significant role in the saturation index (SI) of minerals. It also shows that the relationship of electrical conductivity to the SI of these minerals is not significant than that of the ionic strength, log $pCO_2$ values, and alumina silica ratio have significant relation to the SI of these clay minerals. The SI of these clay minerals was spatially distributed to identify the areas of higher SI. Silica has good correlation to SI of Kaolinite, Gibbsite and Montmorillonite and Al has good correlation to SI of all the minerals except to that of Chlorite.</p>

				<title>Spatial and temporal variation of uranium in a shallow weathered rock aquifer in southern India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0911-0920</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Uranium occurs naturally in groundwater and surface water. The objective of this study is to understand the causes for the occurrence of uranium and its spatio-temporal variation in groundwater in a part of Nalgonda district, Andhra Pradesh, south India. Uranium deposits occur in the southeastern part of this area. Groundwater samples were collected from 44 wells every two months from March 2008 to January 2009. The samples were analyzed for pH, ORP and uranium concentration. The uranium concentration in groundwater varies from 0.2 ppb to a maximum of 68 ppb with a mean of 18.5 ppb. About 21.6% of the samples were above the drinking water limit of 30 ppb set by USEPA. The uranium concentration varied with fluctuation in groundwater level, pH and ORP. Uranium concentration in groundwater changes depending on lithology, degree of weathering and rainfall recharge.</p>

				<title>Geochemical characterization of surface water and spring water in SE Kashmir Valley, western Himalaya: Implications to waterârock interaction</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0921-0932</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Water samples from precipitation, glacier melt, snow melt, glacial lake, streams and karst springs were collected across SE of Kashmir Valley, to understand the hydrogeochemical processes governing the evolution of the water in a natural and non-industrial area of western Himalayas. The time series data on solute chemistry suggest that the hydrochemical processes controlling the chemistry of spring waters is more complex than the surface water. This is attributed to more time available for infiltrating water to interact with the diverse host lithology. Total dissolved solids (TDS), in general, increases with decrease in altitude. However, high TDS of some streams at higher altitudes and low TDS of some springs at lower altitudes indicated contribution of high TDS waters from glacial lakes and low TDS waters from streams, respectively. The results show that some karst springs are recharged by surface water; Achabalnag by the Bringi stream and Andernag and Martandnag by the Liddar stream. Calcite dissolution, dedolomitization and silicate weathering were found to be the main processes controlling the chemistry of the spring waters and calcite dissolution as the dominant process in controlling the chemistry of the surface waters. The spring waters were undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite in most of the seasons except in November, which is attributed to the replenishment of the $CO_2$ by recharging waters during most of the seasons.</p>

				<title>Palynofacies characterization for hydrocarbon source rock evaluation in the Subathu Formation of Marhighat, Sirmaur district, Himachal Pradesh</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0933-0938</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with the hydrocarbon source rock evaluation of the Subathu Formation exposed at Marhighat on SarahanâNarag road in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh. Hydrocarbon potential of these sediments is estimated on the basis of palynofacies analysis and thermal alteration index (TAI) values based on the fossil spores/pollen colouration. The analyses are based on the classification and hydrocarbon generation potential of plant derived dispersed organic matter present in the sediments. The palynofacies analysis of Subathu Formation in the area reveal moderate to rich organic matter, with amorphous organic matter constituting the bulk of the total organic matter, followed by charcoal, biodegraded organic matter, fungal remains, spores/pollen and structured terrestrial organic matter. The TAI value for the organic matter in these sediments has been ascertained as 3.00. A dominance of the sapropelic facies (amorphous organic matter) and the measured TAI values for the Subathu sediments in the Marhighat area suggests a good source-rock potential for the hydrocarbon generation.</p>

				<title>Kink bands in thrust regime: Examples from SrinagarâGarhwal area, Uttarakhand, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0939-0948</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deciphers the late stress systems involved in the development of kink bands in the perspective of thrust regime. In kink bands, the correlation coefficient for $\alpha--\beta $ plots is positive near thrusts and negative away from thrusts. The plots show nearly linear relationship near thrusts and non-linear relationship away from thrusts. The rotation was prominent mechanism of kink band formation near thrusts and rotation coupled with shearing, along the kink planes away from thrusts. Along thrusts $\sigma _1$ is horizontal EâW trend and it rotates to horizontal NâS trend away from the thrust. The proposed model establishes that (1) the shearing along kink planes led to angular relationship, $\beta $ &mt; $\alpha $ and (2) the kink planes of conjugate kinks could be used for paleostress analysis even in those cases where shearing along these planes has occurred.</p>

				<title>A decision support system-based procedure for evaluation and monitoring of protected areas sustainability for the Mediterranean region</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0949-0961</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Despite common acknowledgement of the value of protected areas as instruments in ensuring sustainability, and their promotion for the achievement of policies on halting the loss of biodiversity, there is no common approach today for monitoring and evaluating them. This paper presents a novel integrated nature conservation management procedure developed to monitor and evaluate the sustainability of Mediterranean protected areas. This procedure was successfully implemented and formally evaluated by protected area managers in six  Mediterranean countries, results of which are presented here together with an overview of the web-based Decision Support System (DSS) developed to facilitate its wide adoption. The DSS and procedure has been designed and evaluated by managers as a useful tool, which facilitates and provides needed procedural guidance for protected area monitoring whilst minimizing input requirements to do so. The procedure and DSS were developed following a review of existing protected area assessment tools and a detailed primary investigation of the needs and capacity of its intended users. Essentially, the procedure and DSS guides provide the facilities for protected area managers, in following a participatory approach to develop a context-specific sustainability monitoring strategy, for their protected area. Consequently, the procedure is, by design, participatory, context specific, holistic and relevant to protected area management and institutional procedures. The procedure was piloted and formally evaluated in Greece, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, Malta and Cyprus. Feedback collected from the pilot evaluations is also summarised herein.</p>

				<title>Numerical study of mechanism of fold formation in a laminated rock</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0965-0978</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A set of large deformation experiments are presented to simulate folding pattern at various energy states during formation. In order to numerically simulate this phenomenon, a rectangular layer of shale is generated and compressed at various strain rates. The results reveal the variation in distribution of stress along the length of the bed. The stress distribution during elastic behaviour of shale bed at low compression rate and the change in stress distribution leading to rupture at high compression rates is discussed. Wavelength, limb length, bulk shortening, stress distribution, displacement of particles along the length of the bed is considered for comparative study of the fold pattern generated at various compression rates. The nature and position of crack generated during the formation of fold is also explained. After rupture in shale bed, the generation of fault and stress distribution in limbs of fold sliding over one another is also described.</p>

				<title>Lithostratigraphic development and neotectonic significance of the Quaternary sediments along the Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF) zone, western India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0979-0999</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF) is a major EâW trending seismically active fault of the Kachchh palaeorift basin whose neotectonic evolution is not known. The present study deals with the eastern part of the KMF zone where the fault is morphologically expressed as steep north facing scarps and is divisible into five morphotectonic segments. The Quaternary sediments occurring in a narrow zone between the EâW trending KMF scarps and the flat Banni plain to the north are documented. The sediments show considerable heterogeneity vertically as well as laterally along the KMF zone. (The Quaternary sediments for a northward sloping and are exposed along the north flowing streams which also show rapid decrease in the depth of incision in the same direction.) The deposits, in general, comprise coarse as well as finer gravelly deposits, sands and aeolian and fluvial miliolites. The Quaternary sediments of the KMF zone show three major aggradation phases. The oldest phase includes the colluvio-fluvial sediments occurring below the miliolites. These deposits are strikingly coarse grained and show poor sorting and large angular clasts of Mesozoic rocks. The sedimentary characteristics indicate deposition, dominantly by debris flows and sediment gravity flows, as small coalescing alluvial fans in front of the scarps. These deposits suggest pre-miliolite neotectonic activity along the KMF. The second aggradation phase comprises aeolian miliolites and fluvially reworked miliolites that have been previously dated from middle to late Pleistocene. The youngest phase is the post-miliolite phase that includes all deposits younger than miliolite. These are represented by comparatively finer sandy gravels, gravelly sands and sand. The sediment characteristics suggest deposition in shallow braided stream channels under reduced level of neotectonic activity along the KMF during post-miliolite time evidenced by vertical dips of miliolites and tilting of gravels near the scarps. The tectonically controlled incision and dissection of the Quaternary deposits is the result of neotectonic activity that continues at present day. The overall nature, sedimentary characteristics and geomorphic setting of the sediments suggest that the KMF remained neotectonically active throughout the Quaternary period.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear genetic-based simulation of soil shear strength parameters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1001-1022</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New nonlinear solutions were developed to estimate the soil shear strength parameters utilizing linear genetic programming (LGP). The soil cohesion intercept (\textit {c}) and angle of shearing resistance ($\phi $) were formulated in terms of the basic soil physical properties. The best models were selected after developing and controlling several models with different combinations of influencing parameters. Comprehensive experimental database used for developing the models was established upon a series of unconsolidated, undrained, and unsaturated triaxial tests conducted in this study. Further, sensitivity and parametric analyses were carried out. \textit {c} and $\phi $ were found to be mostly influenced by the soil unit weight and liquid limit. In order to benchmark the proposed models, a multiple least squares regression (MLSR) analysis was performed. The validity of the models was proved on portions of laboratory results that were not included in the modelling process. The developed models are able to effectively learn the complex relationship between the soil strength parameters and their contributing factors. The LGP models provide a significantly better prediction performance than the regression models.</p>

					<p>The present topography of the F$\breve{a} g\breve{a} raÅ$ Mountains is a snapshot of the long-term evolution that brought about significant alterations of the landscape, and especially of the relief, which has acquired different features depending on the intensity of the relationship between the exogenous and endogenous agents. At present, relief shaping in the study area is controlled by the orographic and climatic features. However, the climate of the high and middle-height mountains is the main cause that determines the mechanism, the intensity and the spatial distribution of the shaping processes. The considerable height of the F$\breve{a} g\breve{a} raÅ$ Mountains, which exceeds 2500 m altitude is responsible for the vertical zonation of climate and vegetation which implicitly induce the setting of the systems of relief modelling, too.</p>

				<page>1033-1041</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mawpyut igneous suite in Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya plateau comprises differentiated suite of ultramaficâmafic rocks. The complex differs from other ultramaficâalkalineâcarbonatite igneous emplacements of Shillong plateau and Mikir Hills like Jesra, Sung, Samchampi complexes, by the absence of alkalineâcarbonatite rocks as major litho-units. Melanite garnet-bearing nepheline syenite, occurs as late phase minor intrusion in Mawpyut igneous complex, posseses alkaline character and shows inubiquitous relation with the host ultramaficâmafic rocks. On the other hand, this alkaline intrusive bodies of the Mawpyut igneous complex shows chemico-mineralogical resemblance with garnet-bearing nepheline syenite, ijolite litho-members of Jesra, Sung, Samchampi complexes of the region. It is interpreted that melanite garnet-bearing nepheline syenite intrusion in Mawpyut is contemporaneous with Jesra, Sung, Samchampi ultramaficâalkalineâcarbonatite complexes and the host rocks of Mawpyut complex is an earlier magmatic activity possibly from a comparatively least enriched source.</p>

					<p>This paper provides first report of silica-rich anthropogenic spherules of varying colour, shape, size, surface texture and chemical composition found in road-deposited sediments (RDS) of Allahabad city, Uttar Pradesh, India. Morphological details and lithophile elemental composition of the silica-rich spherules are compared to microtektites and impact spherules from India to demonstrate their striking morphological similarities and chemical variability. This study suggests the need to use spherule data carefully while assigning an impact origin to spherule-finds or spherule-bearing lithological horizons.</p>

				<page>1055-1066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new analytical solution is developed for describing groundwater level fluctuations in a coupled leaky confined aquifer system which consists of an unconfined aquifer, confined aquifer, and an aquitard in between. The aquifer system has a tidal boundary at the seashore, a no flow boundary at remote inland side, and a confined aquifer extending under the sea and terminated with an outlet-capping. This new solution has shown to be a generalisation of most existing analytical solutions for a tidal aquifer system which includes single confined and leaky confined aquifers. In addition, the solution is used to explore the influences of the dimensionless leakance of the outlet-capping, the dimensionless hydraulic diffusivities, and the leakages of the inland and offshore aquitards on the head responses in the leaky confined aquifer.</p>

				<title>Intermittent reservoir daily-inflow prediction using lumped and distributed data multi-linear regression models</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1067-1084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, multi-linear regression (MLR) approach is used to construct intermittent reservoir daily inflow forecasting system. To illustrate the applicability and effect of using lumped and distributed input data in MLR approach, Koyna river watershed in Maharashtra, India is chosen as a case study. The results are also compared with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. MLR attempts to model the relationship between two or more independent variables over a dependent variable by fitting a linear regression equation. The main aim of the present study is to see the consequences of development and applicability of simple models, when sufficient data length is available. Out of 47 years of daily historical rainfall and reservoir inflow data, 33 years of data is used for building the model and 14 years of data is used for validating the model. Based on the observed daily rainfall and reservoir inflow, various types of time-series, cause-effect and combined models are developed using lumped and distributed input data. Model performance was evaluated using various performance criteria and it was found that as in the present case, of well correlated input data, both lumped and distributed MLR models perform equally well. For the present case study considered, both MLR and ARIMA models performed equally sound due to availability of large dataset.</p>

				<title>A comparative study on isotopic composition of precipitation in wet tropic and semi-arid stations across southern India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1085-1094</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Isotopic composition of monthly composite precipitation samples from Kozhikode (\textit {n} = 31), a wet tropic station and Hyderabad (\textit {n} = 25), a semi-arid station across southern India were studied for a period of four years from 2005 to 2008. During the study period, the Kozhikode station recorded an average rainfall of 3500 mm while the Hyderabad station showed an average rainfall of 790 mm. The average stable isotope values in precipitation at the Kozhikode station were $\delta ^{18}O= â3.52â°$, d-excess = 13.72â°; $\delta ^{18}O = â2.94â°$, d-excess = 10.57â°; and $\delta ^{18}O = â7.53â°$, d-excess = 13.79â°, respectively during the pre-monsoon (MarchâMay), monsoon (JuneâSeptember) and post-monsoon (OctoberâFebruary) seasons. For the Hyderabad station, the average stable isotope values were $\delta ^{18}O = â5.88â°$, d-excess = 2.34â°; $\delta ^{18}O = â4.39â°$, d-excess = 9.21â°; and $\delta ^{18}O = â8.69â°$, d-excess = 14.29â°, respectively for the three seasons. The precipitation at the two stations showed distinctive isotopic signatures. The stable isotopic composition of precipitation at the Hyderabad station showed significant variations from the global trend while the Kozhikode station almost followed the global value. These differences are mainly attributed to the latitudinal differences of the two stations coupled with the differences in climatic conditions.</p>

				<title>Impact of gridpoint statistical interpolation scheme over Indian region</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1095-1112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An analysis system experiment was conducted for the month of June 2008 with Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) analysis scheme using NCMRWFâs (National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting) T254L64 model. Global analyses were carried out for all days of the month and respective forecast runs are made up to 120-hr. These analyses and forecasts are inter-compared with the operational T254L64 model outputs which uses Spectral Statistical Interpolation (SSI) analysis scheme. The prime objective of this study is to assess the impact of GSI analysis scheme with special emphasis on Indian summer monsoon as compared to SSI.</p>
					<p>GSI analysis scheme do have positive impact over India and its surrounding regions. Though not for all but for some fields it is in edge over Spectral Statistical Analysis Scheme. Patterns for the forecast mean error; anomaly correlation and $S_1$ scores with respect to the respective analyses are same for both GSI and SSI. Both have increasing $S_1$ scores, decreasing mean errors and anomaly correlation with the advance of forecast days. The vector wind RMSE of the model forecasts with respect to the analyses is lower for GSI at 850 hPa and higher at 250 hPa. But over tropics GSI is better at both levels. The temperature field of GSI has higher correlation and lower RMSE at both 850 and 250 hPa pressure levels. There are improvements in systematic errors for 850 and 200 hPa temperature field in GSI compared to that in SSI. The depression centre in GSI analysis is closer to observation but has produced more intense depression compared to that of SSI. Rainfall forecast of SSI is better at day-1 whereas GSI is closer to the observation at day-5 forecasts valid at the same day.</p>

				<title>Development of regional wheat VI-LAI models using Resourcesat-1 AWiFS data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1113-1125</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The time of forcing of spatial LAI to crop models at single or multiple stages is important to simulate crop biomass and yield in varying agro-climatic conditions and scales. The high temporal resolution (5-day) by Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) on-board Resourcesat-1 Satellite IRS-P6 with 56 m spatial resolution and large swath (740 km) has substantially increased the availability of regional clear sky optical remote sensing data. The present study aimed at developing empirical vegetation index VI-LAI models for wheat using AWiFS optical data in four bands and \textit {in-situ} measurements sampled over five different agro-climatic regions (ACRs) during 2005â2006 followed by validation during 2006â2007. While nonlinear relations exist for all the three normalized indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and Green NDVI, linear relation was the best fit for ratio vegetation index (RVI). Both NDVI and RVI models generally showed better correlation ranges (0.65â0.84 for NDVI and 0.37â0.76 for RVI) than other indices. The common NDVI-LAI model was found to produce lower root mean square errors (RMSE) between 0.5 and 1.1 from pooled model than those between 0.5 and 1.32 from regional models. The rate of substantial increase in errors from NDVILAI model (RMSE of modelled LAI: 0.85 to 1.28) as compared to RVI-LAI model (RMSE of modeled LAI: 1.12 to 1.17) at LAI greater than 3, than below 3 revealed the early saturation of NDVI than RVI. It is therefore recommended that LAI estimates can be used to force crop simulation model up to early vegetative stage based on NDVI and maximum vegetative to reproductive stages based on RVI.</p>

				<title>Trace fossils from Bhuban Formation, Surma Group (Lower to Middle Miocene) of Mizoram India and their palaeoenvironmental significance</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1127-1143</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed ichnological study performed on the Bhuban Formation, Surma Group (Lower to Middle Miocene) of Mizoram, India reveals the occurrence of rich and diverse trace fossils. These have been collected from the two localities in Aizawl, i.e., Bawngkawn and Ropaiabawk, where sandstone-shale sequence is well exposed. Total 20 ichnospecies of 14 ichnogenera have been identified which include \textit {Arenicolites} isp., \textit {Cochlichnus anguineus, Helminthopsis abeli, Laevicyclus mongraensis, Ophiomorpha borneensis, Palaeophycus tubularis, Palaeophycus heberti, Palaeophycus sulcatus, Palaeophycus alternatus, Pholeus abomasoformis, Pholeus bifurcatus, Planolites beverleyensis, Planolites annularis, Polykladichnus irregularis, Rhizocorallium isp., Skolithos linearis, Taenidium satanassi, Teichichnus rectus, Thalassinoides horizontalis} and \textit {Thalassinoides paradoxicus}. Ethologically these ichnogenera display dwelling and feeding activities of the infaunal organisms. \textit {Arenicolites, Ophiomorpha, Polykladichnus} and \textit {Skolithos} are the members of the \textit {Skolithos} ichnofacies while \textit {Palaeophycus, Planolites, Rhizocorallium} and \textit {Thalassinoides} are the members of the \textit {Cruziana} ichnofacies. The presence of \textit {Skolithos} ichnofacies indicates sandy shifting substrate and high energy conditions in foreshore zone while the \textit {Cruziana} ichnofacies indicate unconsolidated, poorly sorted soft substrate and low energy condition in the shoreface/offshore zone. These ichnogenera indicate foreshore to shoreface-offshore zone of shallow marine environment for the deposition of the rocks of the Bhuban Formation of Mizoram.</p>

				<title>Identification of non-indigenous phytoplankton species dominated bloom off Goa using inverted microscopy and pigment (HPLC) analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1145-1154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An unusual phytoplankton bloom dominated by unidentified green coloured spherical algal cells ($\sim 5 \mu m$ diameter) and dinoflagellates (\textit {Heterocapsa, Scripsiella} and \textit {Gymnodinium}) was encountered along the coast of Goa, India during 27 and 29 January, 2005. Pigment analysis was carried out using both fluorometric and HPLC methods. Seawater samples collected from various depths within the intense bloom area showed high concentrations of Chl \textit {a} (up to 106 mg $m^{â3}$) associated with low bacterial production (0.31 to 0.52 mg C $m^{â3} h^{â1}$) and mesozooplankton biomass (0.03 ml $m^{â3}$). Pigment analyses of the seawater samples were done using HPLC detected marker pigments corresponding to prasinophytes, dinoflagellates and diatoms. Chlorophyll \textit {b} (36â56%) followed by peridinin (15â30%), prasinoxanthin (11â17%) and fucoxanthin (7â15%) were the major diagnostic pigments while pigments of cryptophytes and cyanobacteria including alloxanthin and zeaxanthin formed &mt; 10%. Although microscopic analysis indicated a decline in the bloom, pheaophytin concentrations in the water column measured by both techniques were very low, presumably due to fast recycling and/or settling rate. The unique composition of the bloom and its probable causes are discussed in this paper.</p>

				<title>Petrotectonic framework of granulites from northern part of Chilka Lake area, Eastern Ghats Belt, India: Compressional vis-$\grave{a}$-vis transpressional tectonics</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Granulite-facies rocks occurring north-east of the Chilka Lake anothosite (Balugan Massif) show a complex metamorphic and deformation history. The $M_{1}âD_{1}$ stage is identified only through microscopic study by the presence of $S_1$ internal foliation shown by the $M_1$ assemblage sillimaniteâquartzâplagioclaseâbiotite within garnet porphyroblasts of the aluminous granulites and this fabric is obliterated in outcrop to map-scale by subsequent deformations. $S_2$ fabric was developed at peak metamorphic condition ($M_2{}âD_{2}$Â­) and is shown by gneissic banding present in all lithological units. $S_3$ fabric was developed due to $D_3$ deformation and it is tectonically transposed parallel to $S_2$ regionally except at the hinge zone of the $F_3$ folds. The transposed $S_{2}/S_{3}$ fabric is the regional characteristic structure of the area. The $D_4$ event produced open upright $F_4$ folds, but was weak enough to develop any penetrative foliation in the rocks except few spaced cleavages that developed in the quartzite/garnetâsillimanite gneiss. Petrological data suggest that the $M_{4}âD_{4}$ stage actually witnessed reactivation of the lower crust by late distinct tectonothermal event. Presence of transposed $S_{2}/S_{3}$ fabric within the anorthosite arguably suggests that the pluton was emplaced before or during the $M_{3}âD_{3}$ event. Field-based large-scale structural analyses and microfabric analyses of the granulites reveal that this terrain has been evolved through superposed folding events with two broadly perpendicular compression directions without any conclusive evidence for transpressional tectonics as argued by earlier workers. Tectonothermal history of these granulites spanning in Neoproterozoic time period is dominated by compressional tectonics with associated metamorphism at deep crust.</p>

				<title>Temporal and spatial variations in the magnitude of completeness for homogenized moment magnitude catalogue for northeast India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0019-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Northeast India region is one of the most seismically active areas in the world. Events data for the period 1897â2010, used in this study has been largely compiled from global ISC, NEIC and GCMT databases. Historical seismicity catalogue of Gupta \textit {et al} (1986) and some events data from the bulletins of India Meteorological Department are also used. Orthogonal regression relations for conversion of body and surface wave magnitudes to \textit {M}_{w,HRVD} based on events data for the period 1978â2006 have been derived. An Orthogonal Standard Regression (OSR) relationship has also been obtained for scaling of intensity estimates to \textit {M}_{w,NEIC} using 126 global intensity events with intensity VI or greater during the period 1975â2010.</p>
					<p>Magnitude of completeness and GutenbergâRichter (GR) recurrence parameter values have been determined for the declustered homogenized catalogue pertaining to four different time periods namely, 1897â1963, 1964â1990, 1964â2000 and 1964â2010. The \textit {M_c} and â\textit {b}â values are observed to decrease and increase, respectively, with addition of newer data with time. The study region has been subdivided into nine seismogenic zones keeping in view the spatial variations in earthquake occurrence and prevalent tectonics. \textit {M_c}, â\textit {b}â and â\textit {a}â values have been estimated with respect to each zone, and the variations in the values of these parameters have been analysed.</p>

				<title>Fluidârock interaction across the South Tibetan Detachment, Garhwal Himalaya (India): Mineralogical and geochemical evidences</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0029-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Malari Leucogranite in the Garhwal Himalaya is cut across by a continental-scale normal fault system called the South Tibetan Detachment (STD). A mineralogical, geochemical and fluid inclusion study of samples from the fault zone of the Malari Granite was performed to reveal the imprints of fluidârock interaction. Fluid inclusion assemblages observed in the alteration zone indicate the presence of NaCl-dominated aqueous fluids with varied salinity of 6 â16 wt.% of NaCl equivalent. Mineralogical changes include the alteration of feldspar to muscovite and muscovite to chlorite. This alteration took place at temperatures of $275^\circ â335^\circ C$ and pressures between 1.9 and 4.2 kbars as revealed by the application of chlorite thermometry, fluid isochores, and presence of K-feldspar+muscovite+chlorite+quartz mineral assemblage. Geochemical mass-balance estimates predict 32% volume loss during alteration. An estimated fluid/rock ratio of 82 is based on loss of silica during alteration, and reveals presence of a moderately low amount of fluid at the time of faulting.</p>
					<p>Results of fluid inclusion and alteration mineralogy indicate that the Malari Leucogranites were exhumed due to normal faulting along the STD and erosion from mid-crustal levels. Most of the leucogranites in the Himalayas occur along the STD and possibly a regional-scale fluid flow all along the STD might have caused similar alteration of leucogranites along this tectonic break. Regional fluid flow was probably concentrated along the STD and channelized through mesoscopic fractures, microcracks and grain boundaries.</p>

				<title>A genetic algorithm approach for assessing soil liquefaction potential based on reliability method</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0045-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deterministic approaches are unable to account for the variations in soilâs strength properties, earthquake loads, as well as source of errors in evaluations of liquefaction potential in sandy soils which make them questionable against other reliability concepts. Furthermore, deterministic approaches are incapable of precisely relating the probability of liquefaction and the factor of safety (FS). Therefore, the use of probabilistic approaches and especially, reliability analysis is considered since a complementary solution is needed to reach better engineering decisions. In this study, Advanced First-Order Second-Moment (AFOSM) technique associated with genetic algorithm (GA) and its corresponding sophisticated optimization techniques have been used to calculate the reliability index and the probability of liquefaction. The use of GA provides a reliable mechanism suitable for computer programming and fast convergence. A new relation is developed here, by which the liquefaction potential can be directly calculated based on the estimated probability of liquefaction (\textit {P_L}), cyclic stress ratio (CSR) and normalized standard penetration test (SPT) blow counts while containing a mean error of less than 10% from the observational data. The validity of the proposed concept is examined through comparison of the results obtained by the new relation and those predicted by other investigators. A further advantage of the proposed relation is that it relates \textit {P_L} and FS and hence it provides possibility of decision making based on the liquefaction risk and the use of deterministic approaches. This could be beneficial to geotechnical engineers who use the common methods of FS for evaluation of liquefaction. As an application, the city of Babolsar which is located on the southern coasts of Caspian Sea is investigated for liquefaction potential. The investigation is based primarily on \textit {in situ} tests in which the results of SPT are analysed.</p>

				<title>Suspended sediment concentration and particle size distribution, and their relationship with heavy metal content</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0063-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper aims at assessing the feasibility of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) estimation by using predictor variables of heavy metal concentration (HMC, viz., iron, chromium, zinc and nickel) transported in solution and solid. The study was conducted in the Research and Educational Forest Watershed of the Tarbiat Modares University (Kojour) which comprises an area of ca. 50000 ha. For this study, suspended sediment samples were collected from the left bank of the Kojour River twice a week, as well as during runoff events from November 2007 to June 2008. The samples were then prepared through direct digestion and finally analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The relationship between SSC and particle size distribution (PSD) were correlated with HMC by using bivariate and multivariate regression models. Proposed models were then selected based on statistical criteria. The results showed high correlation between dissolved and particulate chromium content with efficiency coefficients beyond 77% (\textit {P} &mt; 0.001). However, a lower relationship was found between SSC and nickel content. From these results, it is clearly shown that the HMC can practically be estimated by SSC in watersheds with different accuracy and vice versa. It is also understood that heavy metal pollution can be easily managed by controlling SSC.</p>

				<title>Depositional environment and provenance of Middle Siwalik sediments in Tista valley, Darjiling District, Eastern Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0073-0089</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The frontal part of the active, wedge-shaped Indo-Eurasian collision boundary is defined by the Himalayan fold-and-thrust belt whose foreland basin accumulated sediments that eventually became part of the thrust belt and is presently exposed as the sedimentary rocks of the Siwalik Group. The rocks of the Siwalik Group have been extensively studied in the western and Nepal Himalaya and have been divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Subgroups. In the DarjilingâSikkim Himalaya, the Upper Siwalik sequence is not exposed and the Middle Siwalik Subgroup exposed in the Tista river valley of Darjiling Himalaya preserves a $\sim 325$ m thick sequence of sandstone, conglomerate and shale. The Middle Siwalik section has been repeated by a number of north dipping thrusts. The sedimentary facies and facies associations within the lithostratigraphic column of the Middle Siwalik rocks show temporal repetition of sedimentary facies associations suggesting oscillation between proximal-, mid- and distal fan setups within a palaeo-alluvial fan depositional environment similar to the depositional setup of the Siwalik sediments in other parts of the Himalaya. These oscillations are probably due to a combination of foreland-ward movement of Himalayan thrusts, climatic variations and mountain-ward shift of fanapex due to erosion. The Middle Siwalik sediments were derived from Higher- and Lesser Himalayan rocks. Mineral characteristics and modal analysis suggest that sedimentation occurred in humid climatic conditions similar to the moist humid climate of the present day Eastern Himalaya.</p>

				<title>Mineral chemistry of lava flows from Linga area of the Eastern Deccan Volcanic Province, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0091-0108</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several basaltic lava flows have been identified in the study area in and around Linga, in the Eastern Deccan Volcanic Province (EDVP) on the basis of distinctly developed structural zones defined by primary volcanic structures such as columnar joints and vesicles. These basaltic lava flows are spatially distributed in four different sectors, viz., (i) BargonaâGadarwara (BG) sector (ii) ShikarpurâLinga (SL) sector (iii) ArjunvariâSurvir Hill (AS) sector and (iv) KukrachimanâMorand Hill (KM) sector. A threetier classification scheme has been adopted for the characterization and classification of individual lava flows. Each lava flow consists of a Lower Colonnade Zone (LCZ) overlain by the Entablature Zone (EZ) and Upper Colonnade Zone (UCZ). The LCZ and UCZ grade into a distinct/indistinct Lower Vesicular Zone (LVZ) and Upper Vesicular Zone (UVZ), respectively. The LCZ and UCZ of the flows are characterized by columnar joints while the EZ is marked by multi-directional hackly jointing. The geometry of different joint patterns corresponds to different styles of cooling during solidification of lava flows. Detailed petrographic studies of the investigated lava flows reveal inequigranular phenocrystal basalts characterized by development of phenocrystal phases including plagioclase, clinopyroxene and olivine, whereas groundmass composition is marked by tiny plagioclase, clinopyroxene, opaque mineral and glass. Electron microprobe analyses indicate that the olivine has a wide range $\sim Fo_{22} to Fo_{66}$ revealing a wide spectrum of compositional variation. Pyroxene compositions are distinctly designated as Quad pyroxenes. Phenocrystal pyroxenes are mostly diopsidic, while the groundmass pyroxenes mainly correspond to augite with a minor pigeonite component. Pyroxene phenocrysts are characterized by a prominent Tienrichment. Phenocrystal plagioclase grains are calcic ($An_{52.7}âAn_{72.9}$), whereas groundmass plagioclase are relatively sodic ($An_{39.2}âAn_{61.6}$). Groundmass opaque minerals are characteristically found to be Tiâmagnetite/ilmenite/pyrophanite. Pyroxene thermometry reveals a temperature span of $850^\circ to 1280^\circ C$ for the studied lavas while olivineâclinopyroxene thermometry yields a temperature range from $1040^\circ â1160^\circ C$. The variation of temperature for the lava flows is ascribed to their normal cooling history after eruption.</p>

				<title>Hydrochemistry of surface water and groundwater from a fractured carbonate aquifer in the Helwan area, Egypt</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0109-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Groundwater is an important water resource in the Helwan area, not only for drinking and agricultural purposes, but also because several famous mineral springs have their origin in the fractured carbonate aquifer of the region. The area is heavily populated with a high density of industrial activities which may pose a risk for groundwater and surface water resources. The groundwater and surface water quality was investigated as a basis for more future investigations. The results revealed highly variable water hydrochemistry. High values of chloride, sulphate, hardness and significant mineralization were detected under the industrial and high-density urban areas. High nitrate contents in the groundwater recorded in the southern part of the study area are probably due to irrigation and sewage infiltrations from the sewage treatment station. The presence of shale and marl intercalation within the fissured and cavernous limestone aquifer promotes the exchange reactions and dissolution processes. The groundwater type is sodium, sulphate, chloride reflecting more mineralized than surface water. The results also showed that water in the study area (except the Nile water) is unsuitable for drinking purposes, but it can be used for irrigation and industrial purposes with some restrictions.</p>

					<p>This paper evaluates the performance of three soft computing techniques, namely Gene-Expression Programming (GEP) (Zakaria \textit {et al} 2010), Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) (Ab Ghani \textit {et al} 2011), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) in the prediction of total bed material load for three Malaysian rivers namely Kurau, Langat and Muda. The results of present study are very promising: FFNN (\textit {R}^{2} = 0.958, RMSE = 0.0698), ANFIS (\textit {R}^{2} = 0.648, RMSE = 6.654), and GEP (\textit {R}^{2} = 0.97, RMSE = 0.057), which support the use of these intelligent techniques in the prediction of sediment loads in tropical rivers.</p>

				<title>Holocene climatic fluctuations from Lower Brahmaputra flood plain of Assam, northeast India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0135-0147</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Pollen analysis of a 3.2-m deep sedimentary profile cored from the Dabaka Swamp, Nagaon District, Lower Brahmaputra flood plain, Assam has revealed persistent fluvial activity during 14,120â12,700 cal years BP which may be attributed to the paucity of pollen and spores with encounterance of fluvial marker taxa like \textit {Ludwigia octavalvis} and \textit {Botryococcus}. Later, fluvial activity was succeeded by the tropical tree savanna under cool and dry climate between 12,700 and 11,600 cal years BP corresponding to that of global Younger Dryas. Between 11,600 and 8310 cal years BP, relatively less cool and dry climate prevailed with inception of tropical mixed deciduous taxa like \textit {Shorea robusta} and \textit {Lagerstroemia parviflora}. This phase is further followed by a fluvial activity between 8310 and 7100 cal years BP as evidenced by trace values of pollen and spores. Fluvial activity was further succeeded by enrichment of tropical mixed deciduous forest under warm and humid climatic regime between 7100 and 1550 cal years BP which is well-matched with the peak period of the Holocene climatic optimum. However, during 1550â768 cal years BP, final settlement of tropical mixed deciduous forest occurred under increased warm and humid climate followed by deterioration in tropical mixed deciduous forest under warm and relatively dry climatic regime since 768 cal years BP onwards due to acceleration in human settlement as evidenced by Cerealia. Increase in \textit {Melastoma, Ziziphus} and \textit {Areca catechu} imply forest clearance at this phase. The occurrence of degraded pollen-spore along with adequate fungal elements especially, \textit {Xylaria, Nigrospora} and Microthyriaceous fruiting body is suggestive of aerobic microbial digenesis of rich organic debris during sedimentation.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0149-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Field geomorphology and remote sensing data, supported by Optical Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating from the Mandakini river valley of the Garhwal Himalaya enabled identification of four major glacial events; Rambara Glacial Stage (RGS) ($13 \pm 2 ka$), Ghindurpani Glacial Stage (GhGS) ($9 \pm 1 ka$), Garuriya Glacial Stage (GGS) ($7 \pm 1 ka$) and Kedarnath Glacial Stage (KGS) ($5 \pm 1 ka$). RGS was the most extensive glaciation extending for $\sim 6$ km down the valley from the present day snout and lowered to an altitude of 2800 m asl at Rambara covering around $\sim 31 km^2$ area of the Mandakini river valley. Compared to this, the other three glaciations (viz., GhGS, GGS and KGS) were of lower magnitudes terminating around $\sim 3000, \sim 3300$ and $\sim 3500$ m asl, respectively. It was also observed that the mean equilibrium line altitude (ELA) during RGS was lowered to 4747 m asl compared to the present level of 5120 m asl. This implies an ELA depression of $\sim 373$ m during the RGS which would correspond to a lowering of $\sim 2^\circ C$ summer temperature during the RGS. The results are comparable to that of the adjacent western and central Himalaya implying a common forcing factor that we attribute to the insolation-driven monsoon precipitation in the western and central Himalaya.</p>

				<title>Late Quaternary fine silt deposits of Jammu, NW Himalaya: Genesis and climatic significance</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0165-0182</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fine silt deposits of Jammu (J & K State, India) stretch all along the Siwalik foothills from Jammu to the Potwar Plateau in Pakistan. The post-Siwalik deposits, first discussed by de Terra and Paterson (1939), are attributed to wind action. The deposits termed as âPotwar loessic siltâ comprising sandy silt are essentially of late Quaternary age (75â18 ka) and are re-looked herein from the point of view of genesis and climatic significance. The sorting, skewness and kurtosis parameters of fine silts of Jammu suggest fluvial environment of the deposits wherein the water budget fluctuated. The weak pedogenesis of fine silts at certain intervals corroborate to periods of less or no sedimentation. The bivariant plot studies further suggest fluvial environment of deposition for the fine silt at Jammu, with regular fluctuations in the budget of river water that was perhaps in consonance with oscillations in the climate of the region.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new fossil fruit wing of \textit {Shorea} Roxb. belonging to the family Dipterocarpaceae is described from the Early Miocene sediments of Kachchh, Gujarat. It resembles best the extant species \textit {Shorea macroptera} Dyer, which is a prominent member of the tropical evergreen forests of the Malayan Peninsula. The present finding, along with the other megafossil records described from the same area, indicates a  typical tropical vegetation with a warm and humid climate at the time of deposition in contrast to the present day xeric vegetation in the area. As the family Dipterocarpaceae no longer exists in western India, it is essential to discuss the time of its extinction and possible causes, which may include drastic changes in the climate of the region. The present finding also supports the theory of a Malaysian origin for the family in contrast to the hypothesis of a Gondwanan origin.</p>

				<title>Impact of global warming on cyclonic disturbances over south Asian region</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0203-0210</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A state-of-the-art regional climate modelling system, known as PRECIS (Providing REgional Climates for Impacts Studies) developed by the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, UK is applied over the Indian domain to investigate the impact of global warming on the cyclonic disturbances such as depressions and storms. The PRECIS simulations at $50 \times 50$ km horizontal resolution are made for two time slices, present (1961â1990) and the future (2071â2100), for two socioeconomic scenarios A2 and B2. The model simulations under the scenarios of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and sulphate aerosols are analysed to study the likely changes in the frequency, intensity and the tracks of cyclonic disturbances forming over north Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) and the Indian landmass during monsoon season. The model overestimates the frequency of cyclonic disturbances over the Indian subcontinent in baseline simulations (1961â1990). The change is evaluated towards the end of present century (2071â2100) with respect to the baseline climate. The present study indicates that the storm tracks simulated by the model are southwards as compared to the observed tracks during the monsoon season, especially for the two main monsoon months, viz., July and August. The analysis suggests that the frequency of cyclonic disturbances forming over north Indian Ocean is likely to reduce by 9% towards the end of the present century in response to the global warming. However, the intensity of cyclonic disturbances is likely to increase by about 11% compared to the present.</p>

				<title>Audible thunder characteristic and the relation between peak frequency and lightning parameters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0211-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent summers, some natural lightning optical spectra and audible thunder signals were observed. Twelve events on 15 August 2008 are selected as samples since some synchronizing information about them are obtained, such as lightning optical spectra, surface E-field changes, etc. By using digital filter and Fourier transform, thunder frequency spectra in observation location have been calculated. Then the two main propagation effects, finite amplitude propagation and attenuation by air, are calculated. Upon that we take the test thunder frequency spectra and work backward to recalculate the original frequency spectra near generation location. Thunder frequency spectra and the frequency distribution varying with distance are researched. According to the theories on plasma, the channel temperature and electron density are further calculated by transition parameters of lines in lightning optical spectra. Pressure and the average ionization degree of each discharge channel are obtained by using Saha equations, charge conservation equations and particle conservation equations. Moreover, the relationship between the peak frequency of each thunder and channel parameters of the lightning is studied.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric aerosol characteristics retrieved using ground based solar extinction studies at Mohal in the Kullu valley of northwestern Himalayan region, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0221-0235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aerosol parameters are measured using a ground-based Multi-wavelength Radiometer (MWR) at Mohal ($31.90^\circ N, 77.11^\circ E, 1154 m$ amsl) in the Kullu valley during clear sky days of a seasonal year. The study shows that the values of spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) at 500 nm and the Ãngstrom turbidity coefficient â$\beta $â (a measure of columnar loading in atmosphere) are high ($0.41 \pm 0.03, 0.27 \pm 0.01$) in summer, moderate ($0.30 \pm 0.03, 0.15 \pm 0.03$) in monsoon, low ($0.19 \pm 0.02, 0.08 \pm 0.01$) in winter and lowest ($0.18 \pm 0.01, 0.07 \pm 0.01$) in autumn, respectively. The Ãngstrom wavelength exponent â$\alpha $â (indicator of the fraction of accumulation-mode particles to coarse-mode particles) has an opposite trend having lowest value ($0.64 \pm 0.06$) in summer, low ($0.99 \pm 0.10$) in monsoon, moderate ($1.20 \pm 0.15$) in winter and highest value ($1.52 \pm 0.03$) in autumn. The annual mean value of AOD at 500 nm, â$\alpha $â and â$\beta $â are $0.24 \pm 0.01, 1.06 \pm 0.09$ and $0.14 \pm 0.01$, respectively. The fractional asymmetry factor is more negative in summer due to enhanced touristsâ arrival and also in autumn months due to the monthlong International Kullu Dussehra fair. The AOD values given by MWR and satellite-based moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer have good correlation of 0.76, 0.92 and 0.97 on diurnal, monthly and seasonal basis, respectively. The AODs at 500 nm as well as â$\beta $â are found to be highly correlated, while â$\alpha $â is found to be strongly anti-correlated with temperature and wind speed suggesting high AODs and turbidity but low concentration of fine particles during hot and windy days. With wind direction, the AOD and â$\beta $â are found to be strongly anti-correlated, while â$\alpha $â is strongly correlated.</p>

				<page>0237-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has been established that radon and its airborne decay products can present serious radiation hazards. A long term exposure to high concentration of radon causes lung cancer. Besides, it is also known that out of the total radiation dose received from natural and man-made sources, 60% of the dose is due to radon and its progeny. Taking this into account, an attempt has been made to estimate radon concentration in dwellings in and around Guwahati using aluminium dosimeter cups with CR-39 plastic detectors. Results of preliminary investigation presented in this paper show that the mean concentration is 21.31 Bq $m^{â3}$.</p>

				<page>0241-0250</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study was carried out to evaluate the seasonal variations of seaweed biomass and species composition at six different sites along the coastal areas in Bushehr Province. Sampling depths varied among sites, from 0.3 to 2.0 m below mean sea level. A total of 37 (i.e., 10 Chlorophyta, 12 Phaeophyta and 15 Rhodophyta) seaweed species were collected. Studies were conducted for quantifying the seaweeds during four seasons from October 2008 until July 2009. During present research, \textit {Ulva intestinalis} and \textit {Cladophora nitellopsis} of green, \textit {Polycladia myrica, Sirophysalia trinodis} and \textit {Sargassum angustifolium} of brown and \textit {Gracilaria canaliculata} and \textit {Hypnea cervicornis} of red seaweeds showed highest biomass in coastal areas of Bushehr Province. The Cheneyâs ratio of 2.1 indicated a temperate algal flora to this area. All sites exhibited more than 50% similarity of algal species, indicating a relatively homogenous algal distribution. Total biomass showed the highest value of $3280.7 \pm 537.8$ g dry wt $m^{â2}$ during summer and lowest value of $856.9 \pm 92.0$ g dry wt $m^{â2}$ during winter. During this study, the highest and lowest seaweed biomass were recorded on the site 2 ($2473.7 \pm 311.0 g$ dry wt $m^{â2}$) and site 5 ($856.7 \pm 96.8 g$ dry wt $m^{â2}$), respectively.</p>

				<title>Altimeter data assimilation in the tropical Indian Ocean using water property conserving scheme</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0251-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Altimeter data have been assimilated in an ocean general circulation model using the water property conserving scheme. Two runs of the model have been conducted for the year 2004. In one of the runs, altimeter data have been assimilated sequentially, while in another run, assimilation has been suppressed. Assimilation has been restricted to the tropical Indian Ocean. An assessment of the strength of the scheme has been carried out by comparing the sea surface temperature (SST), simulated in the two runs, with \textit {in situ} derived as well as remotely sensed observations of the same quantity. It has been found that the assimilation exhibits a significant positive impact on the simulation of SST. The subsurface effect of the assimilation could be judged by comparing the model simulated depth of the $20^\circ C$ isotherm (hereafter referred to as D20), as a proxy of the thermocline depth, with the same quantity estimated from ARGO observations. In this case also, the impact is noteworthy. Effect on the dynamics has been judged by comparison of simulated surface current with observed current at a moored buoy location, and finally the impact on model sea level forecast in a free run after assimilation has been quantified in a representative example.</p>

				<title>Impact of continental meteorology and atmospheric circulation in the modulation of Aerosol Optical Depth over the Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0263-0272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time series analysis of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) derived from NOAA-AVHRR data during the period 1996â1999 and the MODIS data during 2000â2009 over the Arabian Sea revealed a systematic biennial variability in the high AOD during summer months. The variability is more prominent over the northern and central parts of the Arabian Sea and became less significant towards southern latitudes. The possible mechanisms for these are examined by estimating the source strength over coastal Arabia and AOD flow rate through the western boundary of the Arabian Sea. Both these show clear signatures of biennial variability with same phase as AOD for most of the years. This result indicates that the observed biennial variability in AOD is likely to be the outcome of combined effects of biennial variability in wind generated sea-salt aerosols and dust transported from Arabia.</p>

				<title>Development of multimodel ensemble based district level medium range rainfall forecast system for Indian region</title>
				<feature></feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>India Meteorological Department has implemented district level medium range rainfall forecast system applying multimodel ensemble technique, making use of model outputs of state-of-the-art global models from the five leading global NWP centres. The pre-assigned grid point weights on the basis of anomaly correlation coefficients (CC) between the observed values and forecast values are determined for each constituent model at the resolution of $0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ $ utilizing two season datasets (1 Juneâ30 September, 2007 and 2008) and the multimodel ensemble forecasts (day-1 to day-5 forecasts) are generated at the same resolution on a real-time basis. The ensemble forecast fields are then used to prepare forecasts for each district, taking the average value of all grid points falling in a particular district. In this paper, we describe the development strategy of the technique and performance skill of the system during summer monsoon 2009. The study demonstrates the potential of the system for improving rainfall forecasts at five days time scale over Indian region. Districtwise performance of the ensemble rainfall forecast reveals that the technique, in general, is capable of providing reasonably good forecast skill over most states of the country, particularly over the states where the monsoon systems are more dominant.</p>

				<title>Rainfall and temperature scenarios for Bangladesh for the middle of 21st century using RegCM</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0287-0295</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Regional Climate Model of version 3 (RegCM3) was driven with Emissions Scenarios A2 of ECHAM4 at $0.54^\circ \times 0.54^\circ $ horizontal grid resolution in two parameterizations: Grell scheme with ArakawaâSchubert (GAS) and FritchâChappell (GFC) assumptions. The simulated rainfall and mean surface air temperature were calibrated and validated against ground-based observed data in Bangladesh during the period 1961â1990. The Climate Research Unit (CRU) data is also used for understanding the model performance. Better performance of RegCM3 obtained through validation process, made it confident in utilizing it in rainfall and temperature projection for Bangladesh in the middle of 21st century. Rainfall and mean surface air temperature projection for Bangladesh is experimentally obtained for 2050 and 2060. This work discloses that simulated rainfall and temperature are not directly useful in application-oriented tasks. However, after calibration and validation, reasonable performance can be obtained in estimating seasonal and annual rainfall, and mean surface air temperature in Bangladesh. The projected change of rainfall for Bangladesh is about +35% for monsoon season (JJAS), â67% for pre-monsoon (MAM), â12% for post-monsoon (ON) and 107% for winter (DJF) for 2050. On an average, rainfall may be less by more than 50% for all seasons for the year 2060. Similarly, change of mean surface air temperature in different months is projected about $0.5^\circ â2.1^\circ C$ and $0.9^\circ â3.5^\circ C$ for the year 2050 and 2060, respectively.</p>

				<title>The diagnosis of severe thunderstorms with high-resolution WRF model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0297-0316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thunderstorm, resulting from vigorous convective activity, is one of the most spectacular weather phenomena in the atmosphere. A common feature of the weather during the pre-monsoon season over the Indo-Gangetic Plain and northeast India is the outburst of severe local convective storms, commonly known as âNorâwestersâ(as they move from northwest to southeast). The severe thunderstorms associated with thunder, squall lines, lightning and hail cause extensive losses in agricultural, damage to structure and also loss of life. In this paper, sensitivity experiments have been conducted with the Non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM) to test the impact of three microphysical schemes in capturing the severe thunderstorm event occurred over Kolkata on 15 May 2009. The results show that the WRF-NMM model with Ferrier microphysical scheme appears to reproduce the cloud and precipitation processes more realistically than other schemes. Also, we have made an attempt to diagnose four severe thunderstorms that occurred during pre-monsoon seasons of 2006, 2007 and 2008 through the simulated radar reflectivity fields from NMM model with Ferrier microphysics scheme and validated the model results with Kolkata Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) observations. Composite radar reflectivity simulated by WRF-NMM model clearly shows the severe thunderstorm movement as observed by DWR imageries, but failed to capture the intensity as in observations. The results of these analyses demonstrated the capability of high resolution WRF-NMM model in the simulation of severe thunderstorm events and determined that the 3 km model improve upon current abilities when it comes to simulating severe thunderstorms over east Indian region.</p>

				<title>The performance of different cumulus parameterization schemes in simulating the 2006/2007 southern peninsular Malaysia heavy rainfall episodes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0317-0327</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The performance of four different cumulus parameterization schemes (CPS) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for simulating three heavy rainfall episodes over the southern peninsular Malaysia during the winter monsoon of 2006/2007 were examined. The modelled rainfall was compared with the 3-hourly satellite observation and objectively scored using a verification technique called the acuityâfidelity. The technique is based on minimization of a cost function that is calculated from four parameters taking into account errors in distance, time, intensity, and missed events. All simulations were made for 72 hours for the three episodes starting at 1200 UTC 17 December 2006, 1200 UTC 24 December 2006 and 1200 UTC 11 January 2007, respectively. The four different CPSs used are the new KainâFritsch scheme (KF2), the BettsâMillerâJanjic scheme (BMJ), the GrellâDevenyi ensemble scheme (GD) and the older KainâFritsch scheme (KF1). While the BMJ scheme shows some success in the second and third episodes, it shows high location errors in the first episode, leading to high acuity errors. The GD, KF2 and KF1 schemes performed poorly, although both the BMJ and GD schemes simulated the observed drastic increase of rainfall at 2100 UTC 18 December 2006 during the first episode. Overall, the KF1 and KF2 schemes produced positive biases in terms of coverage, while the GD scheme showed persistent location bias, producing a scattered line of precipitation over the eastern coastline of peninsular Malaysia. Although the BMJ scheme has better results, its poor performance for the first episode suggests that suitability of CPS may be case dependent.</p>

				<title>Wintertime land surface characteristics in climatic simulations over the western Himalayas</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0329-0344</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wintertime regional climate studies over the western Himalayas with ICTP-RegCM3 simulations through 22 years has shown systematic biases in precipitation and temperature fields. The model simulated precipitation shows systematically wet bias. In surface temperature simulations, positive and negative biases of $2^\circ â4^\circ C$ occurred. Experiment without (CONT) and with subBATS (SUB) shows that later scheme performs better, especially for precipitation. Apart from the role of topography and model internal variability, land surface characteristics also have profound impact on these climatic variables. Therefore, in the present study, impacts of land surface characteristics are investigated through cool/wet and warm/dry winter climate by CONT and SUB simulations to assess systematic biases. Since SUB experiment uses detailed land-use classification, systematic positive biases in temperature over higher elevation peaks are markedly reduced. The change has shown reduced excessive precipitation as well. Most of the surface characteristics show that major interplay between topography and western disturbances (WDs) takes place along the foothills rather than over the higher peaks of the western Himalayas.</p>

				<title>Ionospheric irregularities at Antarctic using GPS measurements</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0345-0353</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The purpose of this work is to study the behaviour of the ionospheric scintillation at high latitude during geomagnetically quiet and disturbed conditions which is one of the most relevant themes in the space weather studies. Scintillation is a major problem in navigation application using GPS and in satellite communication at high latitudes. Severe amplitude fading and strong scintillation affect the reliability of GPS navigational system and satellite communication. To study the effects of the ionospheric scintillations, GPS receiver installed at Antarctic station Maitri (Geog. $70.76^\circ S; 11.74^\circ E$) was used. The data is collected by using GISTM 4004A, NOVATELâS GPS receiver during March 2008. Studies show that percentage occurrence of phase scintillation is well correlated with geomagnetic activity during the observation period. The result also shows that very intense scintillations can degrade GPS based location determination due to loss of lock of satellites. These findings indicate that the dependence of scintillations and irregularity occurrence on geomagnetic activity is associated with the magnetic local time (MLT). Large number of patches are reported and their activity depends on the magnetic activity index.</p>

				<title>Development of a perfect prognosis probabilistic model for prediction of lightning over south-east India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0355-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A prediction model based on the perfect prognosis method was developed to predict the probability of lightning and probable time of its occurrence over the south-east Indian region. In the perfect prognosis method, statistical relationships are established using past observed data. For real time applications, the predictors are derived from a numerical weather prediction model. In the present study, we have developed the statistical model based on Binary Logistic Regression technique. For developing the statistical model, 115 cases of lightning that occurred over the south-east Indian region during the period 2006â2009 were considered. The probability of lightning (yes or no) occurring during the 12-hour period 0900â2100 UTC over the region was considered as the predictand. The thermodynamic and dynamic variables derived from the NCEP Final Analysis were used as the predictors. A three-stage strategy based on Spearman Rank Correlation, Cumulative Probability Distribution and Principal Component Analysis was used to objectively select the model predictors from a pool of 61 potential predictors considered for the analysis. The final list of six predictors used in the model consists of the parameters representing atmospheric instability, total moisture content in the atmosphere, low level moisture convergence and lower tropospheric temperature advection. For the independent verifications, the probabilistic model was tested for 92 days during the months of May, June and August 2010. The six predictors were derived from the 24-h predictions using a high resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model initialized with 00 UTC conditions. During the independent period, the probabilistic model showed a probability of detection of 77% with a false alarm rate of 35%. The Brier Skill Score during the independent period was 0.233, suggesting that the prediction scheme is skillful in predicting the lightning probability over the south-east region with a reasonable accuracy.</p>

				<title>Surface ozone scenario at Pune and Delhi during the decade of 1990s</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0373-0383</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Data on surface ozone concentration compiled for a 10-year period from 1990 to 1999 for Pune and Delhi are analyzed in terms of its frequency distribution, annual trend, diurnal variation and its relation with various meteorological and chemical parameters. It is found that the surface ozone concentration range showing highest frequency of occurrence at Pune is 0â5 ppb during winter and post-monsoon seasons and 15â20 ppb and 5â10 ppb during summer and monsoon seasons, respectively. It is 0â5 ppb at Delhi during all the seasons. The surface ozone concentration has shown a decreasing trend at Pune during the observational period with an average rate of decrease of 1.54 ppb/year. On the other hand, there is no trend whatsoever in the variation of surface ozone concentration at Delhi. Minimum value of surface ozone occurs before sunrise and maximum in the afternoon hours. Regression analyses of surface ozone with maximum temperature (\textit {r} = 0.46 for Pune and 0.51 for Delhi, significant at more than 0.1%) and $NO_2$ at respective locations indicate that surface ozone at these locations is mainly produced by photochemistry. Transport mechanism is also understood to have contributed significantly to the total concentration of ozone. Inverse relationship obtained between surface ozone concentration and relative humidity indicates that major photochemical paths for removal of ozone become effective when humidity increases at these locations.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0385-0392</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wave prediction and hindcast studies are important in ocean engineering, coastal infrastructure development and management. In view of sparse and infrequent \textit {in-situ} observations, model derived hindcast wave data can be used for the assessment of wave climate in offshore and coastal areas. In the present study, MIKE 21 SW Model has been used to carry out wave hindcast experiments in the Indian Ocean. Model runs have been made for the year 2005 using QuickSCAT scatterometer winds blended with ECMWF model winds. In order to study the impact of southern ocean swells, the model has been run in two different domains, with the southern boundary being shifted far south for the Domain 60S model. The model simulated wave parameters have been validated by comparing with buoy and altimeter data and various statistical yardsticks have been employed to quantify the validation. Possible reason for the poorer performance of the model in the Arabian Sea has also been pointed out.</p>

				<title>Variations in nearshore waves along Karnataka, west coast of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0393-0403</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wind wave spectra were recorded simultaneously at three shallow (water depth 7â9 m) locations (Malpe, Honnavar and Karwar) along the 200 km stretch of the state of Karnataka in 2009 during 27 Aprilâ24 May (representing conditions prior to onset of the Indian summer monsoon), 12 Juneâ8 July (monsoon), and 1â31 October (post-monsoon). Each spectrum was based on data recorded for half an hour using a waverider buoy. The paper describes characteristics of the spectra and the wave parameters derived from the spectra. Both reveal the dramatic changes that occur in the wave field due to the summer monsoon. The changes were virtually identical at all the three locations suggesting that the wave characteristics described here are representative of the conditions that exist along the coast of Karnataka State, west coast of India.</p>

				<title>Lower Oligocene bivalves of Ramanian Stage from Kachchh, Gujarat, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0405-0438</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Marine Oligocene sequences in India outcrop only in western part of Kachchh. Earlier researchers have recognized the Oligocene strata under the Nari Series (Nagappa 1959; Chatterji and Mathur 1966). The Nari Series has a type area in Pakistan. It has two subdivisions â the Lower Nari (Lower Oligocene) and the Upper Nari (Upper Oligocene). It seems that there is no valid proof about the age of the Lower Nari due to lack of proper fauna (Eames 1975), and according to Pascoe (1962), the Upper Nari slightly transgress into Aquitanian (Lower Miocene), therefore, one has to be very cautious. Biswas and Raju (1971) reclassified the Oligocene strata of Kachchh and lithostratigraphically clubbed them as the Maniyara Fort Formation with type section along the Bermoti stream. This Formation has four members. The lower three members correspond to the Ramanian Stage (Lower Oligocene, Biswas 1971, 1973) while the uppermost to the Waiorian Stage (Upper Oligocene, Biswas 1965, 1971, 1973). The Ramanian Stage is characterized by large forams especially \textit {Nummulites fichteli, Nummulites fichteli intermedius, Lepidocyclina (Eulepidina) dialata} and \textit {Operculina} sp. Several ostracods are also known to occur. Megafauna include bivalves, gastropods, echinoids, corals, mammals and reptiles. Concerning bivalves earlier researchers have recorded a few taxa namely \textit {Trisidos semitorta} (Lamarck), \textit {Cubitostrea angulata} (J de C Sowerby), \textit {Pecten (Amussiopecten) labadyei} dâArchiac and Haime, \textit {Periglypta puerpera} (Linneâ) var. \textit {aglaurae} Brongniart, \textit {Ostrea fraasi} Mayer Eymer and listed \textit {Pecten laevicostatus} J de C Sowerby, \textit {Callista pseudoumbonella} Vredenburg and \textit {Clementia papyracea} (Gray) from Kachchh as against overall 42 forms from the Nari Series as a whole (Vredenburg 1928). This tempted us to make an attempt to collect bivalve fauna systematically which are occurring prolifically in the Ramanian Stage. In the present work, for this purpose, sections are worked out around Lakhpat ($23^\circ 50^\prime N; 68^\circ 47^\prime ^\prime E$), Maniyara Fort ($23^\circ 28^\prime 05^\prime ^\prime N; 68^\circ 37^\prime E$) Rakhdi Dam ($23^\circ 27^\prime 26^\prime ^\prime N; 68^\circ 40^\prime 10^\prime ^\prime E$) and Waior ($23^\circ 25^\prime 05^\prime ^\prime N;: 68^\circ 41^\prime 37^\prime ^\prime E$) with a view to highlight the entombed bivalve taxa. Authors have encountered 53 species of which 23 are restricted to the Ramanian Stage.</p>

				<title>Spatial variation of the aftershock activity across the Kachchh Rift Basin and its seismotectonic implications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0439-0451</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyzed 3365 relocated aftershocks with magnitude of completeness (\textit {Mc}) $\geq 1.7$ that occurred in the Kachchh Rift Basin (KRB) between August 2006 and December 2010. The analysis of the new aftershock catalogue has led to improved understanding of the subsurface structure and of the aftershock behaviour. We characterized aftershock behaviour in terms of \textit {a}-value, \textit {b}-value, spatial fractal dimension (\textit {D_s}), and slip ratio (ratio of the slip that occurred on the primary fault and that of the total slip). The estimated \textit {b}-value is 1.05, which indicates that the earthquake occurred due to active tectonics in the region. The three dimensional \textit {b}-value mapping shows that a high \textit {b}-value region is sandwiched around the 2001 Bhuj mainshock hypocenter at depths of 20â25 km between two low \textit {b}-value zones above and below this depth range. The \textit {D_s}-value was estimated from the double-logarithmic plot of the correlation integral and distance between hypocenters, and is found to be $2.64 \pm 0.01$, which indicates random spatial distribution beneath the source zone in a two-dimensional plane associated with fluid-filled fractures. A slip ratio of about 0.23 reveals that more slip occurred on secondary fault systems in and around the 2001 Bhuj earhquake (\textit {Mw} 7.6) source zone in KRB.</p>

				<title>Analysis of lineament swarms in a Precambrian metamorphic rocks in India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0453-0462</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Addressing the geologic significance of lineaments and their correlation with joints/fractures is still unclear. The present study attempts to analyse the lineament swarms developed in a Precambrian metamorphic terrain in India using both unfiltered and filtered techniques. The unfiltered analysis technique shows that the major lineament and fracture trends are oriented along EW and NS directions respectively, thus failing to provide any correlation between them. The application of domain-based filtering techniques identifies a highly predominant fracture-correlated lineaments in mica schist constituting the EW trending shear zone in the area. This correlation is not evident in the areas north and south of the shear zone, where the lineaments are consistently oriented along the foliation planes of the rocks and are designated as âfoliation correlatedâ. The present analysis indicates that the fracture frequency and the strain history may have played significant roles for the formation of fracture-correlated lineaments in the metamorphic terrain.</p>

				<title>Statistical models of interoccurrence times of Iranian earthquakes on the basis of information criteria</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0463-0474</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By analyzing the seismic catalogue of Iran, the probability distributions of interoccurrence times of earthquakes were investigated for different seismotectonic settings. Several probability distributions were applied to data from major seismotectonic provinces in different cut-off magnitudes and the distribution parameters were determined through the method of maximum likelihood. With the help of goodness-of-fit tests (AIC and BIC criteria based on information theory, KolmogorovâSmirnov test) and the coefficient of determination, we have found that the gamma statistics and generalized normal statistics coexist in interoccurrence time statistics. Our results imply that a transition from a generalized normal regime to a gamma regime occurs if the threshold magnitude in certain seismotectonic regions (AlborzâAzarbayejan, Zagros, and Central-East Iran) is changed.</p>

				<title>A study on seismicity and seismic hazard for Karnataka State</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0475-0490</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a detailed study on the seismic pattern of the state of Karnataka and also quantifies the seismic hazard for the entire state. In the present work, historical and instrumental seismicity data for Karnataka (within 300 km from Karnataka political boundary) were compiled and hazard analysis was done based on this data. Geographically, Karnataka forms a part of peninsular India which is tectonically identified as an intraplate region of Indian plate. Due to the convergent movement of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate, movements are occurring along major intraplate faults resulting in seismic activity of the region and hence the hazard assessment of this region is very important. Apart from referring to seismotectonic atlas for identifying faults and fractures, major lineaments in the study area were also mapped using satellite data. The earthquake events reported by various national and international agencies were collected until 2009. Declustering of earthquake events was done to remove foreshocks and aftershocks. Seismic hazard analysis was done for the state of Karnataka using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches incorporating logic tree methodology. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) at rock level was evaluated for the entire state considering a grid size of $0.05^\circ \times 0.05^\circ $. The attenuation relations proposed for stable continental shield region were used in evaluating the seismic hazard with appropriate weightage factors. Response spectra at rock level for important Tier II cities and Bangalore were evaluated. The contour maps showing the spatial variation of PGA values at bedrock are presented in this work.</p>

				<title>Identifying key processes in the hydrochemistry of a basin through the combined use of factor and regression models</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0491-0507</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An innovative technique of measuring the intensities of major sources of variation in the hydrochemistry of (ground) water in a basin has been developed. This technique, which is based on the combination of R-mode factor and multiple regression analyses, can be used to measure the degrees of influence of the major sources of variation in the hydrochemistry without measuring the concentrations of the entire set of physico-chemical parameters which are often used to characterize water systems. R-mode factor analysis was applied to the data of 13 physico-chemical parameters and 50 samples in order to determine the major sources of variation in the hydrochemistry of some aquifers in the western region of Ghana. In this study, three sources of variation in the hydrochemistry were distinguished: the dissolution of chlorides and sulfates of the major cations, carbonate mineral dissolution, and silicate mineral weathering. Two key parameters were identified with each of the processes and multiple regression models were developed for each process. These models were tested and found to predict these processes quite accurately, and can be applied anywhere within the terrain. This technique can be reliably applied in areas where logistical constraints limit water sampling for whole basin hydrochemical characterization. Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) applied to the data revealed three major groundwater associations distinguished on the basis of the major causes of variation in the hydrochemistry. The three groundwater types represent $NaâHCO_{3}, CaâHCO_{3}$, and NaâCl groundwater types. Silicate stability diagrams suggest that all these groundwater types are mainly stable in the kaolinite and montmorillonite fields suggesting moderately restricted flow conditions.</p>

				<title>Geochemical characteristics of Mesoproterozoic metabasite dykes from the Chhotanagpur Gneissic Terrain, eastern India: Implications for their emplacement in a plate margin tectonic environment</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0509-0523</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A number of mafic intrusive bodies (mostly dykes) are exposed in the Chhotanagpur Gneissic Terrain (CGT). Most dykes trend in ENEâWSW to EâW following major structural trends of the region. These metabasite dykes show granoblastic to grano-nematoblastic textures and contain hornblende, plagioclase, chlorite, quartz and epidote which suggest their metamorphism under amphibolite grade PâT conditions. Although no radiometric age is available for the metabasite dykes, field relationships with host rock and available geochronology on granitoids suggest their emplacement during Mesoproterozoic. Geochemical characteristics of these dykes classify them as low-K tholeiite to medium-K calcalkaline type. At least two types of metabasite dykes are recognized on the basis of their HFSE contents; one group shows entirely calc-alkaline nature, whereas the other group has rocks of tholeiite-calc-alkaline series. High Mg# observed in a number of samples indicates their derivation from primary melt. Multielement spidergrams and rare-earth element patterns observed in these samples also corroborate their derivation from different magma batches. Trace element patterns observed for NbâTa, HfâZr, Sr and Y suggesting involvement of subduction related processes in the genesis of CGT metabasite dykes. Perceived geochemical characteristics suggest that metamorphism did not affect much on the chemistry of metabasites but source region, responsible for the generation of CGT metabasites, was possibly modified during subduction process. This study suggests that magma generated in a destructive plate setting fed the Mesoproterozoic mafic dykes of the CGT.</p>

				<title>Mineral chemistry of Pangidi basalt flows from Andhra Pradesh</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0525-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper elucidates the compositional studies on clinopyroxene, plagioclase, titaniferous magnetite and ilmenite of basalts of Pangidi area to understand the geothermometry and oxybarometry conditions. Petrographic evidence and anorthite content (up to 85%) of plagioclase and temperature estimates of clinopyroxene indicate that the clinopyroxene is crystallized later than or together with plagioclase. The higher An content indicates that the parent magma is tholeiitic composition. The equilibration temperatures of clinopyroxene ($1110â1190^\circ C$) and titaniferous magnetite and ilmenite coexisting mineral phases ($1063â1103^\circ C$) are almost similar in lower basalt flow and it is higher for clinopyroxene ($900â1110^\circ C$) when compared to titaniferous magnetite and ilmenite coexisting mineral phases ($748â898^\circ C$) in middle and upper basalt flows. From this it can be inferred that the clinopyroxene is crystallized earlier than FeâTi oxide phases reequilibration, which indicates that the clinopyroxene temperature is the approximate eruption temperature of the present lava flows. The wide range of temperatures ($900â1190^\circ C$) attained by clinopyroxene may point out that the equilibration of clinopyroxene crystals initiated from depth till closer to the surface before the melt erupted. Pangidi basalts follow the QFM buffer curve which indicates the more evolved tholeiitic composition. This suggests the parent tholeiitic magma suffered limited fractionation at high temperature under increasing oxygen fugacity in lower basalt flow and more fractionation at medium to lower temperatures under decreasing oxygen fugacity conditions during cooling of middle and upper basalt flows. The variation of oxygen fugacity indicates the oxidizing conditions for lower basalt flow (9.48â10.3) and extremely reducing conditions for middle (12.1â15.5) and upper basalt (12.4â15.54) flows prevailed at the time of cooling. Temperature \textit {vs.} $(FeO+Fe_{2}O_{3})/(FeO+Fe_{2}O_{3}+MgO)$ data plots for present basalts suggested the lower basaltic flow is formed at higher temperatures while the middle and upper basalt flows at medium to lower temperatures. The lower basalt flow is represented by higher temperatures which shows high modal values of opaques and glass whereas the medium to lower temperatures of middle and upper flow are caused by vesicular nature which contain larger content of gases and humid to semi-arid conditions during cooling.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The palynostratigraphic data given here are based on the explored borecores (TRBD-2, TRBD-3 and TROD-1), by Geological Survey of India. The Permian strata worked-out is about 1174.00 m thick and comprises from base to top â Talchir, Barakar and Barren Measures formations. The palynological content enables delimitation of five palynological assemblages. (i) \textit {Scheuringipollenites barakarensis}, (ii) \textit {Faunipollenites varius}, (iii) \textit {Gondisporites raniganjensis}, (iv) \textit {Densipollenites magnicorpus}, and (v) \textit {Krempipollenites indicus} in ascending order from the subsuface rock strata. The lithologically identified strata Talchir Formation in borecores TRBD-2 and TRBD-3 is palynologically dated late Early Permian in having the \textit {Scheuringipollenites barakarensis} and the \textit {Faunipollenites varius} palynozones. Subsequently, the part of Barakar strata in these borecores corroborates with Barakar Formation. In borecore TRBD-3, the Barren Measures rocks do not match with the palynological dates, and are affiliated with the palynoflora of the Raniganj Formation. In TROD-1, the strata identified as Barakar Formation is dated Late Permian in having \textit {Gondisporites ranigangensis} Palynozone; while that of Barren Measures Formation is palynologically dated Early Triassic having \textit {Krempipollenites indicus} Palynozone. The palynology has helped in the precise dating of the Lower Gondwana succession of Odari and Bartikhurd blocks in TatapaniâRamkola Coalfield of South Rewa Gondwana Basin.</p>

				<title>A new atlas of temperature and salinity for the North Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0559-0593</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The most used temperature and salinity climatology for the world ocean, including the Indian Ocean, is the \textit {World Ocean Atlas} (WOA) (Antonov \textit {et al} 2006, 2010; Locarnini \textit {et al} 2006, 2010) because of the vast amount of data used in its preparation. The WOA climatology does not, however, include all the available hydrographic data from the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), leading to the potential for improvement if the data from this region are included to prepare a new climatology. We use all the data that went into the preparation of the WOA (Antonov \textit {et al} 2010; Locarnini \textit {et al} 2010), but add considerable data from Indian sources, to prepare new annual, seasonal, and monthly climatologies of temperature and salinity for the Indian Ocean. The addition of data improves the climatology considerably in the Indian EEZ, the differences between the new \textit {North Indian Ocean Atlas} (NIOA) and WOA being most significant in the Bay of Bengal, where the patchiness seen in WOA, an artifact of the sparsity of data, was eliminated in NIOA. The significance of the new climatology is that it presents a more stable climatological value for the temperature and salinity fields in the Indian EEZ.</p>

				<title>How good are the simulations of tropical SSTârainfall relationship by IPCC AR4 atmospheric and coupled models?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0595-0610</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The failure of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) forced by prescribed SST to simulate and predict the interannual variability of Indian/Asian monsoon has been widely attributed to their inability to reproduce the actual sea surface temperature (SST)ârainfall relationship in the warm Indo-Pacific oceans. This assessment is based on a comparison of the observed and simulated correlation between the rainfall and local SST. However, the observed SSTconvection/rainfall relationship is nonlinear and for this a linear measure such as the correlation is not an appropriate measure. We show that the SSTârainfall relationship simulated by atmospheric and coupled general circulation models in IPCC AR4 is nonlinear, as observed, and realistic over the tropical West Pacific (WPO) and the Indian Ocean (IO). The SSTârainfall pattern simulated by the coupled versions of these models is rather similar to that from the corresponding atmospheric one, except for a shift of the entire pattern to colder/warmer SSTs when there is a cold/warm bias in the coupled version.</p>

				<title>Characteristic features of winter precipitation and its variability over northwest India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0611-0623</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Northwestern parts of India receive considerable amount of precipitation during the winter months of DecemberâMarch. Although, it is only about 15% of the annual precipitation, the precipitation is very important for rabi crops and to maintain the glaciers extend in the Himalaya, which melt and supply water to the rivers during other seasons. The precipitation is mainly associated with the sequence of synoptic systems known as âwestern disturbancesâ. The precipitation has considerable spatial and temporal variability, with maximum precipitation occurring particularly over northern hilly regions, with decreasing influence southwards. The spatially coherent winter precipitation series has been prepared for the largest possible area comprising nine meteorological subdivisions of northwest India, which constitute about 32% of the total area of the country, having similar precipitation characteristics. The precipitation series has been statistically analysed to understand its characteristics and variability. The seasonal precipitation series is found to be homogeneous, Gaussian (normal) distributed and free from persistence. The precipitation variability has increased during the most recent three decades with more excess and deficient years.</p>

				<title>Chemical characterisation of meltwater draining from Gangotri Glacier, Garhwal Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0625-0636</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed analytical study of major cations ($Ca^{2+}, Mg^{2+}, Na^{+}, K^{+}$) and anions ($SO^{2â}_{4} , HCO^{â}_{3} , Cl^{â}, NO^{â}_{3}$ ) of meltwater draining from Gangotri Glacier was carried out to understand major ion chemistry and to get an insight into geochemical weathering processes controlling hydrochemistry of the glacier. In the meltwater, the abundance order of cations and anions varied as follows: $Ca^{2+} &lt; Mg^{2+} &lt; K^{+} &lt; Na^{+}$ and $SO^{2â}_{4} &lt; HCO^{â}_{3} &lt; Cl^{â} &lt; NO^{â}_{3}$ , respectively. Calcium and magnesium are dominant cations while sulphate and bicarbonate are dominant anions. Weathering of rocks is the dominant mechanism controlling the hydrochemistry of drainage basin. The relative high contribution of (Ca+Mg) to the total cations ($TZ^+$), high (Ca+Mg)/(Na+K) ratio (2.63) and low (Na+K)/$TZ^+$ ratio (0.29) indicate the dominance of carbonate weathering as a major source for dissolved ions in the glacier meltwater. Sulphide oxidation and carbonation are the main proton supplying geochemical reactions controlling the rock weathering in the study area. Statistical analysis was done to identify various factors controlling the dissolved ionic strength of Gangotri Glacier meltwater.</p>

				<title>Impact of climate change on flood characteristics in Brahmaputra basin using a macro-scale distributed hydrological model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0637-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Being the highest specific discharge river system in the world, the Brahmaputra river experiences a number of long-duration flood waves during the monsoon season annually. In order to assess the flood characteristics at the basin and tributary scales, a physically based macro-scale distributed hydrological model (DHM) has been calibrated and validated for 9 wet years. The model performance has been evaluated in terms of prediction of the flood characteristics such as peak discharge, flood duration, arrival time of flood wave, timing of the peak flow and number of flood waves per season. Future changes in the flood wave characteristics of the basin have been evaluated using the validated model with bias-corrected future-projected meteorological scenario from a regional climate model (RCM). Likelihood analysis of the simulated flow time series reveals that significant increase in both peak discharge and flood duration is expected for both the pre-monsoonal and monsoonal seasons in the basin, but the number of flood waves per season would be reduced. Under the projected climate change scenario, it is expected that there will be more catastrophic floods in the basin.</p>

				<title>Geoinformatics for assessing the morphometric control on hydrological response at watershed scale in the Upper Indus Basin</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0659-0686</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Five watersheds (W1, W2, W3, W4 and W5) in the upper Indus basin were chosen for detailed studies to understand the influences of geomorphology, drainage basin morphometry and vegetation patterns on hydrology. From the morphometric analysis, it is evident that the hydrologic response of these watersheds changes significantly in response to spatial variations in morphometric parameters. Results indicate that W1, W2 and W5 contribute higher surface runoff than W3 and W4. Further, the topographic and land cover analyses reveal that W1, W2 and W5 generate quick runoff that may result in flooding over prolonged rainy spells. A physically based semi-distributed hydrologic model (soil and water assessment tool, SWAT) was used for simulating the hydrological response from the watersheds. As per the simulations, W5 watershed produces the highest runoff of 11.17 mm/year followed by W1 (7.9 mm/year), W2 (6.6 mm/year), W4 (5.33 mm/year) and W3 (4.29 mm/year). Thus, W5 is particularly more vulnerable to flooding during high rain spells followed by W1, W2, W4 and W3, respectively. Synthetic unit hydrograph analysis of the five watersheds also reveals high peak discharge for W5. The simulated results on the hydrological response from the five watersheds are quite in agreement with those of the morphometric, topographic, vegetation and unit hydrograph analyses. Therefore, it is quite evident that these factors have significant impact on the hydrological response from the watersheds and can be used to predict flood peaks, sediment yield and water discharge from the ungauged watersheds.</p>

				<title>Optimising view angles for the estimation of leaf area index via entropy-difference analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0687-0695</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is important to evaluate the information content of remote sensing data in order to synthetically use multi-source remote sensing data to improve the accuracy and consistency of land surface parameter retrieval. This paper presents a technique for information content evaluation of multi-spectral/angular remote sensing data for the leaf area index (LAI) inversion, the method of entropy-difference analysis.The proposed method is based on a numerical evaluation of the entropy of the observed dataset to learn how much variation in observation is caused by the variation in LAI. The relationship between remote sensing information and the LAI inversion accuracy is validated based on the model-simulated canopy reflectance data and the experiment data. We make the following observation: the larger the entropydifference for canopy reflectance data, the higher the LAI inversion accuracy. That is, choosing a good combination of observation angles is sometimes more important than simply increasing the number of observations. The presented technique may be useful in designing and evaluating quantitative remote sensing algorithms and products.</p>

				<title>Seasonal variability in aerosol optical and physical characteristics estimated using the application of the $Ãngstr\ddot{o} m$ formula over Mohal in the northwestern Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0697-0710</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Investigations of aerosol optical and physical characteristics using the application of $Ãngstr\ddot{o} m$ formula and second order polynomial fit were carried out from April 2006 to March 2009 at Mohal in the Kullu valley. The measurements of spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) were conducted using multiwavelength radiometer (MWR). The AOD at $0.5 \mu m$ wavelength on daily basis (mean $\pm $ standard deviation) for the entire three-year study period is obtained as 0.24 $\pm $ 0.08. Seasonal variations show the highest AOD at $0.5 \mu m$ wavelength with $\sim 0.34 \pm 0.08$ during pre-monsoon (AprilâJuly), followed by $\sim 0.26 \pm 0.08$ during monsoon (AugustâSeptember), $\sim 0.21 \pm 0.05$ during post-monsoon (OctoberâNovember) and $\sim 0.20 \pm 0.07$ during winter (DecemberâMarch). The seasonal values indicate that the AOD at $0.5 \mu m$ wavelength is decreasing from pre-monsoon to winter with a notable reduction around 41%. The $Ãngstr\ddot{o} m$ parameters using least square method is not found appropriate for size distribution particularly when coarse mode aerosols dominate. The coefficients of second order polynomial fit are more appropriate for the discrimination of aerosol size or irrespective to the dominance of either of the aerosols size. The difference in coefficient of polynomial fit is used to get confirmation on the dominant mode during different seasons. Study reveals that about 93%, 72% and 59% of AOD spectra are dominated by a wide range of fine mode fractions or mixture of modes during post-monsoon, winter and monsoon, respectively. On the other hand, during pre-monsoon, 72% of AOD spectra are found to be dominated by coarse mode aerosols.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0711-0722</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presents the nature of annual cycles of tropospheric ozone, cloud occurrences, $NO_2$, rainfall, $SO_2$, SPM, CO, non-methane hydrocarbon and surface solar radiation for the period October 2004 to June 2009 over Alipore ($22.52^\circ N, 88.33^\circ E$), India. Annual cycle of low-level cloud occurrences depicts that the low-level cloud over Alipore had been noticed to occur for many days and nights, particularly from June to September. The low-level cloud occurrences were found in winter months and post-monsoon period. The effect of cloud occurrences on tropospheric ozone concentration has been critically analysed and explained. It has been observed that the concentration of ozone is oscillatory with cloud occurrences and has a slight linear decreasing trend with the increase of cloud occurrences and vice versa. The concentration of tropospheric ozone attained higher value at moderate cloud occurrences and comparatively lower value at both of the lower and higher cloud occurrences. The related possible chemical and physical explanation for role of cloud occurrences on tropospheric ozone has been offered.</p>

				<title>Temporal geoelectric behaviour of dyke aquifers in northern Deccan Volcanic Province, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0723-0732</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Vertical electrical resistivity soundings (VES) were carried out over four major dykes of Nandurbar district in the northern Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) of Maharashtra to investigate the subsurface geological conditions, with an aim of identifying zones with groundwater resource potential. Dykes can act as pathways or barrier to the groundwater flow depending upon the intensity of fracturing in the dyke rock. Whether the dykes act as water conduits or as barriers depends on their structure, location and orientation with respect to the groundwater flow. The Nandurbar district is known for occurrence of dykes and dyke swarms. A total of 33 dykes were demarcated in the study region and four major dykes (D4, D5, D6, and D7) from these were chosen for detailed VES studies. Data were acquired over these four dykes during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods to observe the seasonal variation in groundwater movement. These studies revealed changes in field characters, their attitudes, thickness and structure of the dykes. Longitudinal geoelectrical sections along these dykes demonstrated carrier as well as barrier stretches which identified potential aquifers up to depths of 25â30m below which hard and compact rock exists. These studies also indicated that dykes with sufficient width, length and favourable hydrogeological structure form potential aquifers for the occurrence and movement of groundwater in the study area.</p>

				<title>Diagenesis of Holocene reef and associated beachrock of certain coral islands, Gulf of Mannar, India: Implication on climate and sea level</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0733-0745</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reef and associated beachrock from certain Gulf of Mannar islands (Rameswaram, Kurusadai, Shingle and Appa Island) were studied to assess the diagenetic evidences. Sixty samples were collected from marine terraces and reef platforms. The samples comprised of coral rubbles, shell fragments and lithic fractions. The presence of corals in the form of framework or isolated patches on the reef flat suggests the rapid increase of accommodation and probably absence of terrigenous and siliciclastic inputs. Moreover, the massive coral heads above the transgressive phase suggest the maximum flooding and relatively deepest facies. The freshwater dissolution, association of marine and meteoric cements suggest the semiarid climatic condition with marine diagenesis during sea level lowstands and recharge of freshwater lenses during periodic rainfalls. In addition, the interaction of these mixed carbonate, siliciclastic sediments results in silicification of carbonate components. The reef associated beachrock were deposited in low energy environment with some amount of terrigenous matters derived from Precambrian basement rocks and transported into reef area by ephemeral streams and longshore sediment transport. The incorporation of coral fragments within the siliciclastic sediments are most probably due to the erosion and re-deposition of the sediments.</p>

				<title>Occurrence of helically coiled microfossil \textit {Obruchevella} in the Owk Shale of the Kurnool Group and its significance</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0755-0768</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study reports occurrence of helically coiled microfossil \textit {Obruchevella} Reitlinger from the Owk Shale of the Kurnool Group from the peninsular India. The age of the Kurnool Group is poorly constrained due to the absence of direct radiometric dating and meager palaeobiological data. Occurrence of \textit {Obruchevella} is considered as a typical Vendian marker genus recorded mostly from close to the PrecambrianâCambrian boundary successions. Hence, the present assemblage is important to ascertain the age of the basin. In the Owk Shale, four species of \textit {Obruchevella}, viz., \textit {{O. delicata, O. parva, O. minor} and \textit {O. valdaica} are recorded as organic walled microfossils. Among them \textit {O. valdaica} is the largest in terms of size parameters. On the global scale, the recovered species occur in the Late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian sediments. Therefore, the occurrence of microfossil \textit {Obruchevella} in the Owk Shale and known burrow structures in the Narji Limestone suggest Ediacaran age close to the Cambrian for the Kurnool Basin and challenges the recently assigned esoproterozoic age of the basin.</p>

				<title>Lime muds and their genesis off-Northwestern India during the late Quaternary</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0769-0779</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two sediment types were found in five gravity cores collected from water depths between 56 m and 121 m along the northwestern continental margin of India: lime muds were abundant in the lower section while siliciclastic sediments dominated the upper section. Lime mud-dominated sediments in shelf cores contained 60%â75% carbonate, 0.3%â0.6% Sr and terrigenous minerals, whereas those at the shelf break were found to have &lt; 90% carbonate, 0.6%â0.8% Sr and traces of terrigenous minerals. Aragonite needles showing blunt edges, jointed needles and needles wrapped in smooth aragonite cement were found to be common. Stable (O and C) isotopes of lime mud indicate a potentially freshwater contribution for shelf cores and purely marine contribution for those at the shelf break. Calibrated radiocarbon ages of the lime muds ranged from 17.6â11.9 ka in different cores. The results reported here suggest that the lime muds in the shallow shelf are probably reworked from the Gulf of Kachchh, whereas those at the shelf break were biodetrital, initially formed on the carbonate platform during low stands of sea level and then exported. The change in lime mud-dominated to siliciclastic-dominated sediments in the cores may be due to climate change and rapid rise in sea level during the early Holocene.</p>

				<title>Provenance of the Late Neogene Siwalik sandstone, Kumaun Himalayan Foreland Basin: Constraints from the metamorphic rank and index of detrital rock fragments</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0781-0792</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An understanding about lithology, tectonics and unroofing history of provenance is mostly drawn from the compositional and textural parameters of the detrital fragments. We here use different metamorphic ranks (Rm) and metamorphic index (MI) values of rock fragments present in Late Neogene Siwalik sandstone of the Ramganga sub-basin to infer the provenance history. The study indicates maximum contribution from metamorphic ranks 1 and 2 (Rm1 and Rm2; meta-sedimentary and very low grade metamorphic rocks) and minimum from metamorphic rank 4 (Rm4; high metamorphic grade rocks). The metamorphic index (MI) values range from 118 to 224, with an average of 186. The meta-sedimentary and very low-grade metamorphic rock fragments are derived from the Lesser Himalayan domain. The medium-to-high grade metamorphic fragments are derived from the Lesser Himalayan Crystalline bodies. The abundance of Rm2 and Rm3 detrital modes suggest the exhumation of crystalline bodies of the Ramgarh and Almora most likely occurred prior to 7 Ma and subsequently the source area shifted and resulted abundant supply of Rm1 fragments due to the upliftment along Main Boundary Thrust around 5.55 Ma.</p>

				<title>Petrology, geochemistry of hornblende gabbro and associated dolerite dyke of Paharpur, Puruliya, West Bengal: Implication for petrogenetic process and tectonic setting</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0793-0812</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Paharpur gabbroic intrusive is an arcuate body running eastâwest paralleling the foliation of Chhotanagpur Granite Gneiss which acts as country rock. The main gabbroic body is intruded by a number of dolerite dykes running northâsouth. It is composed of clinopyroxene ($Wo_{48}En_{40}Fs_{12}âWo_{51}En_{40}Fs_{09}$, mg no. 72â82), plagioclase ($An_{52}âAn_{90}$), hornblende (magnesian hornblende to ferro-tschermackite), orthopyroxene ($En_{76}âEn_{79}$) and ilmenite. Hornblende occurs as large poikilitic grain and constitutes around 60% of the rock. Both gabbro and associated dolerite dykes, show relatively primitive character (mg no. 65â73). Primitive mantle-normalized and MORB-normalized spider diagrams indicate enrichment in Rb, Ba, Th, La, Sr and depletion in Nb, Zr, Y, Ti and Nd. The LILE enrichment and Nb, Ti, Zr, Y depletion suggest arc like geochemical signature for the gabbroic and doleritic rocks of Paharpur. Flat to slightly LREE fractionated pattern and variable degree of REE enrichment is observed. An early stage fractionation of clinopyroxene, plagioclase, orthopyroxene, ilmenite and late stage reaction of cumulate pile and evolved melt/hydrous fluid is suggested for magmatic evolution of gabbro. Associated dolerite dykes, which are geochemically similar to the gabbro, have tholeiitic with boninitic character. The mineralogical and chemical compositions of intrusive rocks also have some similarity with mafic rocks of ophiolite complex of subduction zone.</p>

				<title>Gravity anomalies, crustal structure and rift tectonics at the Konkan and Kerala basins, western continental margin of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0813-0822</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Litho-stratigraphic variation of sedimentary units constructed from seismic sections and gravity anomaly in the Konkan and Kerala basins of the western continental margin of India (WCMI) have been used to model processes such as lithospheric rifting mechanism, its strength, and evolution of flank uplift topography that led to the present-day Western Ghats escarpment. Based on the process-oriented approach, two lithospheric models (necking and magmatic underplating) of evolution of the margin were tested. Both, necking and underplating models suggest an effective elastic thickness (Te) of 5 km and 10 km along Konkan and Kerala basins, respectively and a deep level of necking at 20 km at both basins. Model study suggests that the necking model better explains the observed gravity anomalies in the southern part of the WCMI. A synthesis of these results along with the previously published elastic thickness estimates along the WCMI suggests that a low-to-intermediate strength lithosphere and a deeper level of necking explains the observed flank-uplift opography of the Western Ghats. Process-oriented gravity modeling further suggests that the lateral variations in the lithospheric strength, though not very significant, exist from north to south within a distance of 600 km in the Konkan and Kerala basins along the WCMI at the time of rifting. A comparison with previous Te estimates from coherence analysis along the WCMI indicates that the lithospheric strength did not change appreciably since the time of rifting and it is low both onshore and offshore having a range of 5â15 km.</p>

				<title>Spectral evaluation of Earth geopotential models and an experiment on its regional improvement for geoid modeling</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0823-0835</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As the number of Earth geopotential models (EGM) grows with the increasing number of data collected by dedicated satellite gravity missions, CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE, measuring the differences among the models and monitoring the improvements in gravity field recovery are required. This study assesses the performance of recent EGMs derived from CHAMP, GRACE, and other data in comparison to the earlier two models in Turkish territory. Also the improvement capacities of these EGMs using local terrestrial data are inspected with two different approaches. In the first approach, the spherical harmonic coefficients of EGMs are modified depending on the local gravity data. In the second part, the original EGMs with their maximum harmonic expansions are employed in Remove Compute Restore algorithm for high resolution local geoid modelling. The assessment results with the local terrestrial data exhibited large disagreements among the models in Turkey. The outputs from regional improvements of EGMs using the gravity observations clarified the important role of the ground truth data contribution in geopotential models. The validations of the computed high resolution geoids rely on the EGMs at the GNSS/levelling networks, having 451 and 309 benchmarks, provided an absolute accuracy by means of standard deviations of the geoid height differences around 20 cm. These results from the final stage of the case study provide a comparison among the EGMs by means of their fit to the local gravity field.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Narmada South Fault in the Indian peninsular shield region is associated with moderate-to-strong earthquakes. The prevailing hazard evidenced by the earthquake-related fatalities in the region imparts significance to the investigations of the seismogenic environment. In the present study, the prevailing seismotectonic conditions specified by parameters associated with source, path and site conditions are appraised. Stochastic finite-fault models are formulated for each scenario earthquake. The simulated peak ground accelerations for the rock sites from the possible mean maximum earthquake of magnitude \textit {M_W} 6.8 goes as high as 0.24 g while fault-rupture of magnitude \textit {M_W} 7.1 exhibits a maximum peak ground acceleration of 0.36 g. The results suggest that present hazard specification of Bureau of Indian Standards as inadequate. The present study is expected to facilitate development of ground motion models for deterministic and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis of the region.</p>

				<title>Detection of Mg spinel lithologies on central peak of crater Theophilus using Moon Mineralogy Mapper ($M^3$) data from Chandrayaan-1</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0847-0853</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spectral reflectance data derived from Moon Mineralogy Mapper ($M^3$) onboard Indiaâs Chandrayaan-1 has revealed Fe bearing Mg-spinel-rich lithology on central peaks of the crater Theophilus. These newly identified Fe bearing Mg-spinel-rich rock types are defined by their strong 2-$\mu $m absorption and lack of 1-$\mu $m absorptions in spectral reflectance response. Such lithology has been reported previously along the inner ring of Moscoviense Basin on the lunar far side. The Modified Gaussian Modeling (MGM) analysis of the Fe bearing Mg-spinel reflectance spectra has been done and the results of the analysis clearly bring out a strong spectral absorption at 1872 nm with no significant absortion around 1000 nm. The presence of spinel group of minerals in the Theophilus central peak and the fact that central peaks mostly represent uplifted mass of deep crustal material confirm that central peaks can be used as a window to study the deep crustal and/or upper mantle composition and may lead to a fresh perspective about the crustal composition of Moon.</p>

				<title>Monitoring of Gangotri glacier using remote sensing and ground observations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0855-0866</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, Gangotri glacier was monitored using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS-III sensor data in combination with field collected snow-meteorological data for a period of seven years (2001â2008). An overall decreasing trend in the areal extent of seasonal snow cover area (SCA) was observed. An upward shifting trend of wet snow line was observed in the beginning of melt period, i.e., in May and dominant wet snow conditions were observed between May and October. Snow meteorological parameters collected in the Gangotri sub-basin suggest reduction in fresh snowfall amount during winter, increase in rainfall amount during summer, decrease in snowfall days, increase in rainfall days and rising trend of average temperature. The prevailing wet snow condition on glacier has caused scouring of slopes which led the excessive soil/debris deposition on the glacier surface. This was observed as one of the major factor for activating fast melting and affecting the glacier health significantly. Apart from climatic conditions, terrain factors were observed for changing the glacio-morphology. The significant changes on the glacier surface were observed in the regions of abrupt slope change. The above factors affecting the Gangotri glacier health were also validated using high resolution satellite imageries and field visit. A deglaciation of 6% in overall area of Gangotri glacier was observed between the years 1962 and 2006.</p>

				<title>Monsoon sensitivity to aerosol direct radiative forcing in the community atmosphere model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0867-0889</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aerosol forcing remains a dominant uncertainty in climate studies. The impact of aerosol direct radiative forcing on Indian monsoon is extremely complex and is strongly dependent on the model, aerosol distribution and characteristics specified in the model, modelling strategy employed as well as on spatial and temporal scales. The present study investigates (i) the aerosol direct radiative forcing impact on mean Indian summer monsoon when a combination of quasi-realistic mean annual cycles of scattering and absorbing aerosols derived from an aerosol transport model constrained with satellite observed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is prescribed, (ii) the dominant feedback mechanism behind the simulated impact of all-aerosol direct radiative forcing on monsoon and (iii) the relative impacts of absorbing and scattering aerosols on mean Indian summer monsoon. We have used CAM3, an atmospheric GCM (AGCM) that has a comprehensive treatment of the aerosolâradiation interaction. This AGCM has been used to perform climate simulations with three different representations of aerosol direct radiative forcing due to the total, scattering aerosols and black carbon aerosols. We have also conducted experiments without any aerosol forcing. Aerosol direct impact due to scattering aerosols causes significant reduction in summer monsoon precipitation over India with a tendency for southward shift of Tropical Convergence Zones (TCZs) over the Indian region. Aerosol forcing reduces surface solar absorption over the primary rainbelt region of India and reduces the surface and lower tropospheric temperatures. Concurrent warming of the lower atmosphere over the warm oceanic region in the south reduces the landâocean temperature contrast and weakens the monsoon overturning circulation and the advection of moisture into the landmass. This increases atmospheric convective stability, and decreases convection, clouds, precipitation and associated latent heat release. Our analysis reveals a defining negative moisture-advection feedback that acts as an internal damping mechanism spinning down the regional hydrological cycle and leading to significant circulation changes in response to external radiative forcing perturbations. When total aerosol loading (both absorbing and scattering aerosols) is prescribed, dust and black carbon aerosols are found to cause significant atmospheric heating over the monsoon region but the aerosol-induced weakening of meridional lower tropospheric temperature gradient (leading to weaker summer monsoon rainfall) more than offsets the increase in summer-time rainfall resulting from the atmospheric heating effect of absorbing aerosols, leading to a net decrease of summer monsoon rainfall. Further, we have carried out climate simulations with globally constant AODs and also with the constant AODs over the extended Indian region replaced by realistic AODs. Regional aerosol radiative forcing perturbations over the Indian region is found to have impact not only over the region of loading but over remote tropical regions as well. This warrants the need to prescribe realistic aerosol properties in strategic regions such as India in order to accurately assess the aerosol impact.</p>

This study reports the results of radiative transfer simulations for the multichannel infrared sounder of the proposed Indian satellite INSAT-3D due to be launched shortly. Here, the widely used community software k Compressed Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Algorithm (kCARTA) is employed for performing the radiative transfer simulations. Though well established and benchmarked, kCARTA is a line-by-line solver and hence takes enormous computational time and effort for simulating the multispectral radiances for a given atmospheric scene. This necessitates the development of a much faster and at the same time, equally accurate RT model that can drive a real-time retrieval algorithm. In the present study, a fast radiative transfer model using neural networks is proposed to simulate radiances corresponding to the wavenumbers of INSAT-3D. Realistic atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles have been used for training the network. Spectral response functions of GOES-13, a satellite similar in construction, purpose and design and already in use are used. The fast RT model is able to simulate the radiances for 1200 profiles in 18 ms for a 15-channel GOES profile, with a correlation coefficient of over 99%. Finally, the robustness of the model is tested using additional synthetic profiles generated using empirical orthogonal functions (EOF).</p>

				<title>Carbon dioxide and water vapour characteristics on the west coast of Arabian Sea during Indian summer monsoon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0903-0910</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbon dioxide, water vapour, air temperature and wind measurements at 10 Hz sampling rate were carried out over the coast of Arabian Sea, Goa ($15^\circ 21^\prime N, 73^\circ 51^\prime E$) in India. These observations were collected, in association with the surface layer turbulent parameters for the Arabian Sea  Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX). In the summer monsoon period, concentration of $CO_2$ was in the range of 550â790 mg $m^{â3}$ whereas the water vapour was in the range of 17.5â24.5 g $m^{â3}$. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis has been performed on these observations to investigate the spectral behaviour of $CO_2$ and water vapour. The relation between $CO_2$ and water vapour on various atmospheric scales has been proposed. $CO_2$ and water vapour observations confirmed the existence of periodicities of large (11, 8 days), meso (5 days) and micrometeorological (20 min) scales.</p>

				<title>Influences of the boundary layer evolution on surface ozone variations at a tropical rural site in India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0911-0922</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Collocated measurements of the boundary layer evolution and surface ozone, made for the first time at a tropical rural site (Gadanki $13.5^\circ N, 79.2^\circ E$, 375 m amsl) in India, are presented here. The boundary layer related observations were made utilizing a lower atmospheric wind profiler and surface ozone observations were made using a UV analyzer simultaneously in April month. Daytime average boundary layer height varied from 1.5 km (on a rainy day) to a maximum of 2.5 km (on a sunny day). Correlated day-to-day variability in the daytime boundary layer height and ozone mixing ratios is observed. Days of higher ozone mixing ratios are associated with the higher boundary layer height and \textit {vice versa}. It is shown that higher height of the boundary layer can lead to the mixing of near surface air with the ozone rich air aloft, resulting in the observed enhancements in surface ozone. A chemical box model simulation indicates about 17% reduction in the daytime ozone levels during the conditions of suppressed PBL in comparison with those of higher PBL conditions. On a few occasions, substantially elevated ozone levels (as high as 90 ppbv) were observed during late evening hours, when photochemistry is not intense. These events are shown to be due to southwesterly wind with uplifting and northeasterly winds with downward motions bringing ozone rich air from nearby urban centers. This was further corroborated by backward trajectory simulations.</p>

				<title>Sensitivity of tropical cyclone Jal simulations to physics parameterizations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0923-0946</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the sensitivity of numerical simulations of tropical cyclones to physics parameterizations is carried out with a view to determine the best set of physics options for prediction of cyclones originating in the north Indian Ocean. For this purpose, the tropical cyclone Jal has been simulated by the advanced (or state of science) mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model on a desktop mini super computer CRAY CX1 with the available physics parameterizations. The model domain consists of one coarse and two nested domains. The resolution of the coarse domain is 90 km while the two nested domains have resolutions of 30 and 10 km, respectively. The results from the inner most domain have been considered for analyzing and comparing the results. Model simulation fields are compared with corresponding analysis or observation data. The track and intensity of simulated cyclone are compared with best track estimates provided by the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) data. Two sets of experiments are conducted to determine the best combination of physics schemes for track and intensity and it is seen that the best set of physics combination for track is not suitable for intensity prediction and the best combination for track prediction overpredicts the intensity of the cyclone. The sensitivity of the results to orography and level of nesting has also been studied. Simulations were also done for the cyclone Aila with (i) best set of physics and (ii) randomly selected physics schemes. The results of the Aila case show that the best set of physics schemes has more prediction skill than the randomly selected schemes in the case of track prediction. The cumulus (CPS), planetary boundary layer (PBL) and microphysics (MP) parameterization schemes have more impact on the track and intensity prediction skill than the other parameterizations employed in the mesoscale model.</p>

				<title>Nature of light rain during presence and absence of bright band</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0947-0961</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the evolution of rain drop size distribution (DSD) during bright band (BB) and no-BB (NBB) conditions of low intensity rainfall events as observed by a vertically pointing Micro Rain Radar (MRR) over Pune ($18.58^\circ N, 73.92^\circ E$), India. The BB is identified by enhanced radar reflectivity factor \textit {Z} (dBZ) at the $0^\circ C$ isotherm. The gradient of hydrometeor fall velocity is found to be a good indicator in identifying the melting layer when enhanced radar reflectivity at melting layer is not prominent. The storm structures as observed by the MRR are compared with CloudSat observations that provide evidence of ice hydrometeor at $\sim â60^\circ C$ with clear indication of BB at $0^\circ C$. Storm heights at warmer than $0^\circ C$ are evident during NBB conditions from CloudSat. This suggests that warm rain processes are responsible for producing rain during NBB conditions. During BB conditions, bimodal DSDs below the melting layer are observed at lower altitudes. The DSDs of shallow warm precipitating systems of NBB conditions are monomodal at all the altitudes. Significantly, normalized DSDs are found to be bimodal for BB conditions, and monomodal for NBB conditions which confirm different dominant microphysical processes. It is found that the observed bimodal DSDs during BB conditions are mainly due to the collision, coalescence and break-up processes. During NBB conditions, number and size of large raindrops grow while reaching the ground without much breakup. The radar reflectivity and rainfall intensity \textit {R} ($mmh^{â1}$) relationship of the form \textit {Z} = \textit {aR^b} are found out for BB and NBB conditions. Existing different microphysical processes lead to large coefficient in the \textit {ZâR} relationship with small exponent during BB conditions while during NBB conditions the coefficients are small with large exponents.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric water budget over the western Himalayas in a regional climate model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0963-0973</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During winter months (December, January, February â DJF), the western Himalayas (WH) receive precipitation from eastward moving extratropical cyclones, called western disturbances (WDs) in Indian parlance. Winter precipitationâmoisture convergenceâevaporation (PâCâE) cycle is analyzed for a period of 22 years (1981â2002: 1980(D)â1981(J, F) to 2001(D)â2002(J, F)) with observed and modelled (RegCM3) climatological estimates over WH. Remarkable model skills have been observed in depicting the hydrological cycle over WH. Although precipitation biases exist, similar spatial precipitation with well marked two maxima is simulated by the model. As season advances, temporal distribution shows higher precipitation in simulation than the observed. However, PâCâE cycle shows similar peaks of moisture convergence and evaporation in daily climatologies though with varying maxima/minima. In the first half of winter, evaporation over WH is mainly driven by ground surface and 2 m air temperature. Lowest temperatures during mid-winter correspond to lowest evaporation to precipitation ratio as well.</p>

				<title>Offshore wind speed and wind power characteristics for ten locations in Aegean and Ionian Seas</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0975-0987</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper utilizes wind speed data measured at 3 and 10 m above water surface level using buoys at 10 stations in Ionian and Aegean Seas to understand the behaviour of wind and thereafter energy yield at these stations using 5 MW rated power offshore wind turbine. With wind power densities of 971 and 693 $W/m^2$ at 50 m above water surface level, Mykonos and Lesvos were found to be superb and outstanding windy sites with wind class of 7 and 6, respectively. Other locations like Athos, Santorini and Skyros with wind power density of more than 530 $W/m^2$ and wind class of 5 were found to be the excellent sites. Around 15â16% higher winds were observed at 10 m compared to that at 3 m. Lower values of wind speed were found during summer months and higher during winter time in most of the cases reported in the present work. Slightly decreasing ($\sim 2$% per year) linear trends were observed in annual mean wind speed at Lesvos and Santorini. These trends need to be verified with more data from buoys or from nearby onshore meteorological stations. At Athos and Mykonos, increasing linear trends were estimated. At all the stations the chosen wind turbine could produce energy for more than 70% of the time. The wind speed distribution was found to be well represented by Weibull parameters obtained using Maximum likelihood method compared to WAsP and Method of Moments.</p>

				<title>Calibration of regional ionospheric delay with uncombined precise point positioning and accuracy assessment</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0989-0999</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new method for the calibration of regional ionospheric delay based on uncombined precise point positioning (U-PPP) is proposed in this study. The performance of the new method was comparatively validated in terms of its accuracy and robustness with respect to the phase-smoothed pseudorange (PSP) method through two short-baseline experiments. Accuracy of the PPP-derived ionospheric delays was further assessed by interpolating them to a user station to perform single-frequency simulated kinematic PPP. Two 24-hr period datasets of four continuous operation reference system (CORS) stations were analyzed, collected during calm and disturbed ionospheric conditions, respectively. The single-frequency GPS observables from a user station, that were \textit {a-priori} corrected by the interpolated ionospheric delays, were utilized to implement single-frequency PPP (SF-PPP). The results show that interpolation accuracy is better than 1 dm and, with the proposed method, is less affected by the ionospheric activity; meanwhile, positioning accuracy of SF-PPP was $4\sim 5$ cm (horizontal) and better than 1 dm (vertical). For comparison, two reference SF-PPP solutions were also obtained, in which the ionospheric delays are eliminated either by forming semi-combination observations or by using global ionosphere maps (GIM) model values; in both cases the positioning accuracy was only $4\sim 7$ dm (horizontal) and 1 m (vertical). These results provide a further demonstration of the performance of PPP-based regional ionospheric calibration in the parameter domain.</p>

					<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and image processing are used to determine Total Electron Content (TEC) anomalies in the F-layer of the ionosphere relating to Typhoon Nakri for 29 May, 2008 (UTC). PCA and image processing are applied to the global ionospheric map (GIM) with transforms conducted for the time period 12:00â14:00 UT on 29 May, 2008 when the wind was most intense. Results show that at a height of approximately 150â200 km the TEC anomaly is highly localized; however, it becomes more intense and widespread with height. Potential causes of these results are discussed with emphasis given to acoustic gravity waves caused by wind force.</p>

				<title>Modelling and analyzing the watershed dynamics using Cellular Automata (CA)â Markov model â A geo-information based approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1011-1024</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Improper practices of land use and land cover (LULC) including deforestation, expansion of agriculture and infrastructure development are deteriorating watershed conditions. Here, we have utilized remote sensing and GIS tools to study LULC dynamics using \textit {Cellular Automata (CA)âMarkov} model and predicted the future LULC scenario, in terms of magnitude and direction, based on past trend in a hydrological unit, Choudwar watershed, India. By analyzing the LULC pattern during 1972, 1990, 1999 and 2005 using satellite-derived maps, we observed that the biophysical and socio-economic drivers including residential/industrial development, roadârail and settlement proximity have influenced the spatial pattern of the watershed LULC, leading to an accretive linear growth of agricultural and settlement areas. The annual rate of increase from 1972 to 2004 in agriculture land, settlement was observed to be 181.96, 9.89 ha/year, respectively, while decrease in forest, wetland and marshy land were 91.22, 27.56 and 39.52 ha/year, respectively. Transition probability and transition area matrix derived using inputs of (i) residential/industrial development and (ii) proximity to transportation network as the major causes. The predicted LULC scenario for the year 2014, with reasonably good accuracy would provide useful inputs to the LULC planners for effective management of the watershed. The study is a maiden attempt that revealed agricultural expansion is the main driving force for loss of forest, wetland and marshy land in the Choudwar watershed and has the potential to continue in future. The forest in lower slopes has been converted to agricultural land and may soon take a call on forests occurring on higher slopes. Our study utilizes three time period changes to better account for the trend and the modelling exercise; thereby advocates for better agricultural practices with additional energy subsidy to arrest further forest loss and LULC alternations.</p>

				<title>Gravimetric geoid of a part of south India and its comparison with global geopotential models and GPS-levelling data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1025-1032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Precise information of geoid undulations is essential for obtaining the orthometric heights from Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements over any region; apart from providing the information of subsurface density distribution. This paper presents computation of geoid undulations over a part of southern Indian region from terrestrial gravity and elevation data using removeârestore technique that involves spherical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute âStokesâ coefficients. Computed geoid undulations are compared with geoid obtained from global geopotential models such as EGM2008 and EIGENGRACE02S and measured GPS-levelling records at 67 locations. Statistical analysis of comparison suggests that the computed gravimetric geoid model has a good match with the geoid determined from GPS-levelling with rms of 0.1 m whereas EGM2008 has 0.46 m. The differences of GPS-levelling with EGM2008 at majority of stations fall in the range of $\pm 0.5$ m, which indicates that EGM2008 may be used for orthometric height determination with an accuracy of &mt; 0.5 m in the south Indian region and offers a reasonably good transformation platform from ellipsoid to local datum. However, local determination of geoid is necessary for better accuracy of orthometric height from GPS. The gravimetric geoid calculated from the available gravity data shows considerable improvement to the global model and can be used to achieve orthometric height with an accuracy of 0.1 m.</p>

				<title>Multifractal analysis of earthquakes in Kumaun Himalaya and its surrounding region</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1033-1047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Himalayan seismicity is related to continuing northward convergence of Indian plate against Eurasian plate. Earthquakes in this region are mainly caused due to release of elastic strain energy. The Himalayan region can be attributed to highly complex geodynamic process and therefore is best suited for multifractal seismicity analysis. Fractal analysis of earthquakes (mb $\geq 3.5$) occurred during 1973â2008 led to the detection of a clustering pattern in the narrow time span. This clustering was identified in three windows of 50 events each having low spatial correlation fractal dimension (\textit {D_C}) value 0.836, 0.946 and 0.285 which were mainly during the span of 1998 to 2005. This clustering may be considered as an indication of a highly stressed region. The Guttenberg Richter \textit {b}-value was determined for the same subsets considered for the \textit {D_C} estimation. Based on the fractal clustering pattern of events, we conclude that the clustered events are indicative of a highly stressed region of weak zone from where the rupture propagation eventually may nucleate as a strong earthquake. Multifractal analysis gave some understanding of the heterogeneity of fractal structure of the seismicity and existence of complex interconnected structure of the Himalayan thrust systems. The present analysis indicates an impending strong earthquake, which might help in better hazard mitigation for the Kumaun Himalaya and its surrounding region.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1049-1057</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To evaluate the conventional methods for mapping hydrothermal altered deposits by using Landsat 7 ETM+ image in and around Kuju volcano is the prime target of our study. The Kuju volcano is a mountainous composite which consists of hornblende-andesite lava domes and associated lava flows. We used the colour composite, band ratio, principal component analysis, least square fitting and reference spectra analysis methods. The colour composite and band ratio methods showed very clearly the hydrothermal altered deposits of clay minerals, iron oxides and ferric oxides around the fumaroles. The principal component analysis using the Crosta technique also enabled us to represent undoubtedly the altered hydroxyl and iron-oxide mineral deposits of this region concentrating around the fumaroles. Least square fitting method illustrated the goethite, hematite and clay alteration region. Finally the target detection method for reference spectral analysis by using ENVI 4.3 detected the representative hydrothermal altered minerals around Kuju volcano fumaroles area. Therefore, all the methods showed high efficiency for mapping hydrothermal altered deposits especially iron-oxide minerals such as hematite, goethite and jarosite, which are alteration products of hydrothermal sulfides around the fumaroles.</p>

				<title>Deciphering heavy metal contamination zones in soils of a granitic terrain of southern India using factor analysis and GIS</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1059-1070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Soil contamination by heavy metals has been a major concern for last few decades due to increase in urbanization and industrialization. The main objective of this research was to identify the heavy metal contaminated zones in the study area. Twenty five soil samples collected throughout the agriculture, residential and industrial areas were analysed by X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF) for trace metals and major oxides. These metals can affect the quality of soil and infiltrate through the soil, thereby causing groundwater pollution. Based on the chemical analysis of major oxides ($SiO_{2}, Al_{2}O_{3}, Fe_{2}O_{3}, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na_{2}O, K_{2}O, TiO_{2}$, and $P_{2}O_{5}$) and their distribution; it is observed that these soils are predominantly siliceous type with slight enrichment of alumina component in the study area. Correlation matrix (CM) and factor analysis (FA) is employed to the heavy metal variables, viz., Ba, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sr, V, Y, Zn and Zr of the soil to determine the dominant factors contributing to the soil contamination in the area. In the analysis, five factors emerged as significant contributors to the soil quality. The total contribution of these five factors is about 90%. The contribution of the first factor is about 45% and has significant positive loadings of Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn. The contribution of second factor is 22% and has significant positive loadings of Rb, Sr and Y. The contribution of third, fourth and fifth factors is 10, 8 and 5% and show positive loadings for lead, molybdenum and barium respectively to the soil contamination. The spatial variation maps deciphering different zones of heavy metal concentration in the soil were generated in a GIS (geographic information system) based environment using ArcGIS 9.3.1. The results reveal that heavy metal contamination in the area is mainly due to anthropogenic activities.</p>

					<p>In the study area, changes in the facies of sediments and spores-pollen content appear to be all causally linked with the depositional set-up. Here, the qualitative and quantitative changes observed in the spores-pollen assemblages have led to recognize 10 Assemblage-zones representing from that earliest Permian in the Talchir Formation to that latest Late Triassic in the Parsora Formation. These sporespollen assemblages are obtained from the wider parts in the Singrauli Gondwana Basin that includes (i) Moher sub-basin (boreholes SSM-1 and 2), and (ii) Singrauli main sub-basin (boreholes SMJS-2, 3 and SMBS-1). The progressively changing spores-pollen content infer the hiatuses of varied magnitude in the sedimentary sequences during the extended time interval of Permian and Triassic.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of the Holocene environmental changes of the southwest coast, India: A palaeopalynological approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1093-1103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The climatic variability and the influence of temperature and sea level fluctuations on the earthâs surface configuration during the Holocene are being discussed all over the world. The present study evaluates the palaeo-environmental conditions of western coast of India during this epoch through the analysis of pollen grains embedded in a carbonaceous clay formation ($\cong $0.4â0.6 m) found sandwiched within the palaeodeposit of sand of Meenachil River basin. The carbon dating revealed that the clay formation has an age of $5786 \pm 94 ^{14}C$ yr BP, while the embedded wood samples have the age varying in between $2888 \pm 78$ and $5780 \pm 95 ^{14}C$ yr BP. The overall analysis suggests that the southwestern margin of India had experienced high intensity rainfall during the earlier part of the Atlantic chronozone due to then strengthened Asiatic monsoon, while water stagnation and hydrological modifications were observed during the later part. The dominance of weeds and lesser number of tree elements suggested a drier climate during the end of the Atlantic period. Besides, the morphometric rearrangement of the Meenachil River contemporaneous to the geomorphological modifications of the southwestern coast of India shall be classified into three categories: (1) Pre-Vembanad Lake formation, (2) Contemporaneous to lake formation and (3) Post-Lake formation.</p>

				<title>Glacier fluctuation using Satellite Data in Beas basin, 1972â2006, Himachal Pradesh, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1105-1112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glaciers are widely recognized as sensitive indicators for regional climate change. Very few studies have been conducted to investigate the long term deglaciation status in the Himalaya. In the present study, glaciers in the Beas basin, Himachal Pradesh, India were mapped by interpretation of various glaciomorphological features using the Landsat and IRS images. The mapping of 224 glaciers during the period 1972â2006 reveals that the glacier cover reduced from 419 to 371 $km^2$, witnessing approximately 11.6% deglaciation in the Beas basin. A higher rate of retreat of the glaciers was observed during 1989â2006 as compared to the retreat during 1972â1989. Also, the loss has been more prominent in the glaciers with an areal extent of 2â5 $km^2$. The number of glaciers increased from 224 to 236 due to fragmentation in this period. The average elevation of the ablation zone basin showed an upward shift from 3898 m (1972) to 4171 m (2006) which may be a consequence of a shift in Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) reflecting imbalance.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of short-period rainfall estimates from Kalpana-1 satellite using MET software</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1113-1123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) technique for rainfall estimation, has recently been developed to meet the shortcomings of the Global Precipitation Index (GPI) technique of rainfall estimation from the data of geostationary satellites; especially for accurate short period rainfall estimates. This study evaluates the 3-hourly precipitation estimates by this technique as well as the rainfall estimates by the GPI technique using data of the Kalpana-1 satellite, over the Indian region for the south-west monsoon season of 2010 to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses in estimating short period rainfall. The gridded 3 hourly accumulated TRMM satellite (3B42 V6 product or TMPA product) and surface raingauge data for stations over the Indian region for the same period is used as the standard measure of rainfall estimates. The Method for Object-based Diagnostic Evaluation (MODE) utility of the METv3.0 software, has been used for the evaluation purpose. The results show that the new IMSRA technique is closer to the TMPA rainfall estimate, in terms of areal spread, geometric shape and location of rainfall areas, as compared to the GPI technique. The overlap of matching rainfall areas with respect to TMPA rainfall patches is also higher for the IMSRA estimates as compared to the GPI values. However, both satellite rainfall estimates are observed to be generally higher compared to the TMPA measurements. However, the values for the highest 10% of the rainfall rates in any rainfall patch, is generally higher for rainfall measured by the IMSRA technique, as compared to the estimates by the GPI technique. This may partly be due to the capping maximum limit of 3 mm/hr for rainfall measured by the GPI technique limits the total 3-hour accumulation to 9 mm even during heavy rainfall episodes. This is not so with IMSRA technique, which has no such limiting value. However, this general overestimation of the rainfall amount, measured by both techniques, and the greater error in case of IMSRA estimates, is also validated independently with respect to surface raingauge observations. Hence the observed overestimation by the IMSRA technique for the highest 10th percentile rainfall rates in rainfall episodes, is real. This overestimation by the latter technique may become a significant source of error, if the IMSRA estimate is used for monitoring very heavy rainfall episodes. In all other respects, since the IMSRA method shows significant improvement over the GPI, the rainfall estimates by the IMSRA method may be used for operational short period rainfall estimation.</p>

				<title>Implementation of Polar WRF for short range prediction of weather over Maitri region in Antarctica</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1125-1143</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>India Meteorological Department has implemented Polar WRF model for the Maitri (lat. $70^\circ 45^\prime S$, long. $11^\circ 44^\prime E$) region at the horizontal resolution of 15 km using initial and boundary conditions of the Global Forecast System (GFS T-382) operational at the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Main objective of this paper is to examine the performance skill of the model in the short-range time scale over the Maitri region. An inter-comparison of the time series of daily mean sea level pressure and surface winds of Maitri for the 24 hours and 48 hours forecast against the corresponding observed fields has been made using 90 days data for the period from 1 December 2010 to 28 February 2011. The result reveals that the performance of the Polar WRF is reasonable, good and superior to that of IMD GFS forecasts. GFS shows an underestimation of mean sea level pressure of the order of 16â17 hPa with root mean square errors (RMSE) of order 21 hPa, whereas Polar WRF shows an overestimation of the order of 3â4 hPa with RMSE of 4 hPa. For the surface wind, GFS shows an overestimation of 1.9 knots at 24 hours forecast and an underestimation of 3.7 knots at 48 hours forecast with RMSE ranging between 8 and 11 knots. Whereas Polar WRF shows underestimation of 1.4 knots and 1.2 knots at 24 hours and 48 hours forecast with RMSE of 5 knots. The results of a case study illustrated in this paper, reveal that the model is capable of capturing synoptic weather features of Antarctic region. The performance of the model is found to be comparable with that of Antarctic Meso-scale Prediction System (AMPS) products.</p>

				<title>Abnormally large magnetospheric electric field on 9 November 2004 and its effect on equatorial ionosphere around the world</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1145-1161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There was a solar event around 1850 UT on 9th November 2004, associated with an abnormally large solar wind flow pressure and large southward interplanetary magnetic field, causing an abnormally large prompt penetration electric field between 1850 and 2100 UT. Abnormally large vertical F-region drifts by Jicamarca backscatter radar were reported associated with the event. The F-region over Jicamarca, Peru (14â16 LT) and Sao Luis, Brazil (16â18 LT) was lifted upward, broken into two portions and the upper one was blown out of the range of the ionosonde. At Fortaleza, an off-equatorial station in Brazil, the F-region was also lifted up but later the $f_\circ F_2$ increased due to the flow of ionization from upper layer blown up over the equatorial region. The F-region at Ascension Island (19â21 LT), an off-equatorial station, was lifted up without any deformations till 1915 LT but descended at 1930 LT due to reversal of electric field polarity. At Indian stations, Trivandrum and Waltair (00â02 LT), the F-region was pushed down and later disappeared as a consequence of enhanced westward ionospheric electric field in the night sector. The ionosonde did not receive any echo for a couple of hours till the next sunrise. The F-region at Kototaban (03â05 LT), Indonesia also disappeared after a rapid descend. At Kwajelien (06â08 LT) there was no equatorial type of sporadic-E at 07 to 09 LT due to the westward electric field.</p>

				<title>Surface ozone variation at Bhubaneswar and intra-corelationship study with various parameters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1163-1175</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper summarizes the results of year long (December 2009 to January 2011) continuous measurements of daytime (0700â1745) ozone ($O_3$) in the ambient air and related meteorological parameters at Bhubaneswar ($21^\circ 15^\prime Nâ85^\circ 15^\prime E$), Odisha. The seasonal variation shows distinct daytime ozone maxima during winters with a peak in January ($\sim 85$ ppbv), a slight increase ($\sim 38$ ppbv) in June and lowest in August ($\sim 20$ ppbv). The backward trajectory analysis during winter months suggests long distance transport of airmass from mainly Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and western part of Indian peninsula, a major industrial hub. In other seasons, wind reaches the observation site from less polluted landmasses and the Bay of Bengal, thereby considerably reducing the pollution load. On the contrary, ozone build-up was found to be maximum and minimum in pre-monsoon and monsoon, respectively. An anti-weekend ozone effect ($\sim 5$ ppbv) was observed in winter. Paired t-test and F-test along with principal component analysis (PCA) were done to determine significance between various components (ozone, precursors and meteorological parameters). The t- and F-test showed significant monthly variation of ozone mixing ratio. The PCA showed that three components explained 79.1% of variances.</p>

				<title>Modelling near subsurface temperature with mixed type boundary condition for transient air temperature and vertical groundwater flow</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1177-1184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Near-subsurface temperatures have signatures of climate change. Thermal models of subsurface have been constructed by prescribing time dependent Dirichlet type boundary condition wherein the temperature at the soil surface is prescribed and depth distribution of temperature is obtained. In this formulation it is not possible to include the relationship between air temperatures and the temperature of soil surface. However, if one uses a Robin type boundary condition, a transfer coefficient relates the air and soil surface temperatures which helps to determine both the temperature at the surface and at depth given near surface air temperatures. This coefficient is a function of meteorological conditions and is readily available. We have developed such a thermal model of near subsurface region which includes both heat conduction and advection due to groundwater flows and have presented numerical results for changes in the temperatureâdepth profiles for different values of transfer coefficient and groundwater flux. There are significant changes in temperature and depth profiles due to changes in the transfer coefficient and groundwater flux. The analytical model will find applications in the interpretation of the borehole geothermal data to extract both climate and groundwater flow signals.</p>

				<title>Tomographic, hydrochemical and isotopic investigations of the salinization processes in the oasis shallow aquifers, Nefzaoua region, southwestern Tunisia</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1185-1200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An electrical imaging tomography survey was carried out to identify the lateral and vertical salinity distribution in the oasis shallow aquifers of the Nefzaoua region located in southwestern Tunisia. In addition, hydrochemical and isotopic data were examined to determine the main factors and mechanisms controlling the groundwater chemistry and salinity. Locally, with respect to salinization processes, electrical imaging tomography results show that the storage basins of irrigation excess-water contribute to the increase of the salinity for the major part of the oasis nearby these basins. Major elements distribution and saturation indices indicate that dissolution of evaporites (halite, anhydrite and gypsum) is the main process controlling the groundwater mineralization. Isotopic data highlighted the effect of evaporation in the salinization of these waters. The correlation between the oxygen 18 and the chlorides data confirms the importance of evaporation effect and dissolution as main processes controlling the groundwater mineralization.</p>

				<title>Simulation of suspended sediment transport initialized with satellite derived suspended sediment concentrations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1201-1213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Suspended sediment transport in the Gulf of Kachchh is simulated utilizing the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) derived from Oceansat OCM imagery, as the initial condition in MIKE-21 Mud Transport model. Optimization of the model mud parameters, like settling velocity and critical shear stress for erosion are realized with respect to the sediment size distribution and the bottom bed materials observed in the Gulf. Simulated SSCs are compared with alternate OCM derived SSC. The results are observed to be impetus where the model is able to generate the spatial dynamics of the sediment concentrations. Sediment dynamics like deposition, erosion and dispersion are explained with the simulated tidal currents and OCM derived sediment concentrations. Tidal range is observed as the important physical factor controlling the deposition and resuspension of sediments within the Gulf. From the simulation studies; maximum residual current velocities, tidal fronts and high turbulent zones are found to characterise the islands and shoals within the Gulf, which results in high sediment concentrations in those regions. Remarkable variability in the bathymetry of the Gulf, different bed materials and varying tidal conditions induces several circulation patterns and turbulence creating the unique suspended sediment concentration pattern in the Gulf.</p>

				<title>Behaviour of REEs in a tropical estuary and adjacent continental shelf of southwest coast of India: Evidence from anomalies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1215-1227</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The distribution and accumulation of the rare earth elements (REE) in the sediments of the Cochin Estuary and adjacent continental shelf were investigated. The rare earth elements like La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu and the heavy metals like Mg, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, U, Th were analysed by using standard analytical methods. The Post-Archean Australian Shale composition was used to normalise the rare earth elements. It was found that the sediments were more enriched with the lighter rare earth elements than the heavier ones. The positive correlation between the concentrations of REE, Fe and Mn could explain the precipitation of oxyhydroxides in the study area. The factor analysis and correlation analysis suggest common sources of origin for the REEs. From the Ce-anomalies calculated, it was found that an oxic environment predominates in all stations except the station No. 2. The Eu-anomaly gave an idea that the origin of REEs may be from the feldspar. The parameters like total organic carbon, U/Th ratio, authigenic U, Cu/Zn, V/Cr ratios revealed the oxic environment and thus the depositional behaviour of REEs in the region.</p>

				<title>Vegetation history and salinity gradient during the last 3700 years in Pichavaram estuary, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1229-1237</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Palaeoclimate, palaeoecological and palaeoshoreline studies were carried out for a 2.5 m deep sediment core deposited since $\sim 3700$ yrs BP in the central part of Pichavaram mangrove wetland, Cauvery river delta. Presently, the study area is dominated by \textit {Avicennia officinalis, A. marina and Suaeda} sp. with fringes of \textit {Rhizophora} sp. along the backwater channel. Based on sedimentology, palynological and thecamoebian analysis, it is inferred that since 2100 yrs BP the climate amelioration took place from warm and humid with strengthened monsoon to a dry and arid climate coupled with weakened monsoon condition inducing changes in ecology vulnerable for mangroves. Consequently, the vegetation too evolved from moist deciduous/evergreen forest to mixed deciduous forest and a reduction in mangrove diversity. The qualitative and quantitative study show a decline in the mangroves since the last millennium which may be attributed to the increased salinity along with enhanced anthropogenic activities in Pichavaram estuary. This is reflected by the dominance of salt tolerant mangrove associates since the last millennium.</p>

				<title>Stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental framework of the Early Permian sequence in the Salt Range, Pakistan</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1239-1255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Early Permian Gondwana regime succession of the Nilawahan Group is exposed only in the Salt Range of Pakistan. After a prolonged episode of non-deposition that spanned much of the Palaeozoic, the 350 m thick predominantly clastic sequence of the Nilawahan Group records a late glacial and post-glacial episode in which a range of glacio-fluvial, marine and fluvial environments evolved and accumulated. The Early Permian succession of the Salt Range has been classified into four formations, which together indicates a changing climatic regime during the Early Permian in the Salt Range region. The lower-most, Tobra Formation unconformably overlies a Cambrian sequence and is composed of tillite, diamictite and fresh water facies, which contain a floral assemblage (\textit {Gangamopteris} and \textit {Glossopteris}) that confirms an Asselian age. The Tobra Formation is overlain by marginal marine deposits of the Dandot Formation (Sakmarian), which contain an abundant brachiopods assemblage (\textit {Eurydesma} and \textit {Conularia}). Accumulation of the Dandot Formation was terminated by a regional sea-level fall and a change to the deposition of the fluvial deposits of the Warchha Sandstone (Artinskian). The Warchha Sandstone was deposited by high sinuosity meandering, avulsion prone river with well developed floodplains. This episode of fluvial sedimentation was terminated by a widespread marine transgression, as represented by the abrupt upward transition to the overlying shallow marine Sardhai Formation (Kungurian). The Early Permian Gondwana sequence represented by the Nilawahan Group is capped by predominantly shallow shelf carbonate deposits of the Tethyan realm. The sedimentologic and stratigraphic relationship of these four lithostratigraphic units in the Salt Range reveals a complex stratigraphic history for the Early Permian, which is mainly controlled by eustatic sea-level change due to climatic variation associated with climatic amelioration at the end of the major Gondwana glacial episode, and the gradual regional northward drift to a lower latitude of the Indian plate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Palynological investigations of five borecores, \textit {viz}., GAM-3, GAM-6, GAM-7, GAM-8 and GAM-10 from Mailaram area have suggested the occurrence of complete Lower Gondwana succession in Mailaram area. Total nine palynozones have been identified on the basis of dominance, sub-dominance and appearance of various palynotaxa. These palynozones belong to Talchir, Upper Karharbari and Barakar (Early Permian), Raniganj (Late Permian) and Panchet (Early Triassic) palynofloras of Indian Gondwana. The oldest Palynozone-1 demonstrated in borecore GAM-6 (331.4â500 m) and borecore GAM-10 (505.66â581.55 m), is characterized by the dominance of \textit {Parasaccites} and sub-dominance of \textit {Plicatipollenites} belongs to Talchir Palynoflora; Palynozone-2 identified in borecore GAM-7 (667â749 m) and borecore GAM-8 (89.75 m) is characterized by the dominance of \textit {Parasaccites} and sub-dominance of \textit {Scheuringipollenites} which belongs to Upper Karharbari Palynoflora. Palynozone-3, identified in borecore GAM-6 (149.7â240.05 m) and borecore GAM-8 (84.95 m), is characterized by the dominance of \textit {Scheuringipollenites} akin to \textit {Scheuringipollenites} zone of Barakar palynoflora; Palynozone-4, recorded in borecores GAM-3 (294â437.98 m), GAM-7 (453â640.5 m) and GAM-8 (35.35 m) is characterized by the dominance of \textit {Faunipollenites} and sub-dominance of \textit {Striatopodocarpites} along with certain stratigraphically significant taxa, \textit {viz., Weylandites, Guttulapollenites, Corisaccites, Aurangapollenites} and \textit {Osmundacidites}. Palynozone-5, demarcated in borecore GAM-3 (144.86â221.3 m) and borecore GAM-10 (35.35 m), is distinguished by the dominance of striate disaccates along with at least 30% pollen assigned to \textit {Striasulcites}; Palynozone-6, identified in borecore GAM-3 (35.1â73.08 m) and borecore GAM-7 (231â423 m), is characterized by the dominance of striate disaccates along with 20â30% of \textit {Densipollenites}; Palynozone-7, recorded in borecore GAM-7 (206 m), is distinguished by the dominance of \textit {Crescentipollenites} along with striate disaccates; Palynozone-8, identified in borecore GAM-7 (178.4 m), is characterized by the distinguished presence of taeniate pollen \textit {Guttulapollenites}. Palynozones 4â8 belong to Raniganj Palynoflora. Palynozone-9, identified in borecore GAM-7 (166 m), is discriminated by the dominance of trilete spore \textit {Verrucosisporites} and sub-dominance of taeniate pollen \textit {Lunatisporites} which belongs to Triassic palynoflora. On the basis of palynological data Palynozone-1 (= Talchir palynoflora), Palynozone-2 and Palynozone-3 have been assigned to Early Permian age; Palynozones 4â8 (= Raniganj palynoflora) have been assigned to Late Permian age and Palynozone-9 (= Triassic palynoflora) has been assigned to Early Triassic age. With the aim of correlating the Permian and Triassic sediments of Mailaram area palynological investigations of five borecores were carried out.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The entire 606 m-thick sedimentary sequence in borecore MCP-7 from Chintalapudi area, Chintalapudi sub-basin has been lithologically designated as Kamthi Formation. However, the palynological investigation revealed five distinct palynoassemblages, which essentially fall under two groups, one group (Palynoassemblage-I, II and III) having dominance of striate disaccates along with presence of some stratigraphically significant taxa, belongs to Late Permian (Raniganj) palynoflora, while the other group (Palynoassemblages IV and V) shows sharp decline in percentage of characteristic taxa of first group, i.e., striate disaccates, and consequent rise or dominance of taeniate and cingulate cavate spores, belongs to Early Triassic (Panchet) palynoflora. Palynoassemblage-I, II and III (Group I) are characterized by dominance of striate disaccates chiefly, \textit {Striatopodocarpites} spp. and \textit {Faunipollenites} spp. Along with presence of rare but stratigraphically significant taxa, viz., \textit {Gondisporites raniganjensis, Falcisporites nuthaliensis, Klausipollenites schaubergeri, Chordasporites} sp., \textit {Striomonosaccites, ovatus, Crescentipollenites multistriatus, Verticipollenites debiles, Strotersporites crassiletus, Guttulapollenites hannonicus, G. gondwanensis, Hamiapollenites insolitus, Corisaccites alutus, Lunatisporites ovatus, Weylandites} spp. and \textit {Vitreisporites pallidus}. Palynoassemblage-I is distinguished by significant presence of \textit {Densipollenites} spp. while Palynoassemblage-II shows significant presence of \textit {Crescentipollenites} spp. and Palynoassemblage-III differs from the above two assemblages in having significant presence of \textit {Guttulapollenites hannonicus}. Palynoassemblage-IV (Group II) is characterized by high percentage of taeniate disaccates chiefly \textit {Lunatisporites} spp., while Palynoassemblage-V (Group II) is characterized by cingulate-cavate trilete spores chiefly, \textit {Lundbladispora} spp. and \textit {Densoisporites} spp. Striate disaccates show a sharp decline in these two assemblages.</p>
					<p>In Chintalapudi area Late Permian and Early Triassic palynoflora has been recorded for the first time indicating existence of Raniganj and Panchet sediments as well. The study further supports the earlier studies of Jha and Srivastava (1996) that Kamthi Formation represents Early Triassic (=Panchet Formation) overlying Raniganj equivalent sediments with a gradational contact.</p>

				<title>Toxic gas emissions from the Kayseri peat deposit, central Anatolia, Turkey</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1305-1315</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Toxic gases evolving from the soil in urbanized peatland regions constitute a serious hazard since buildings may be subject to the direct ingress of volatiles into the structures. Peat formed in swamp and rarely exposed to subaerial conditions has been associated with the development of the folded foreland of the Quaternary Kayseri pull-apart basin. The peat deposit is extensively urbanized but so far no studies have evaluated the extent of the ground gas hazard. In this paper, the geology, petrography and chemical variation of the Kayseri peat deposit have been studied in order to predict the public health risk from the land gasesâ behaviour, especially in soil gases. The main volatile species detected are methane ($CH_4$), hydrogen sulphide ($H_{2}S$) and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), all of which are highly toxic. The primary means of gas entry is directly from the ground through the floors, walls, and especially subsurface telephone cable pipes. Indoor vents emit 1000â70,000 ppm $CH_4$, 330â49,000 ppm $CO_2$ and 3.8â6.5 ppm $H_{2}S$ in soil and subsurface pipes; concentrations high enough to present an acute respiratory hazard to persons close to the vents.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry of abyssal peridotites from the super slow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge near $65^\circ E$: Implications for magma source and seawater alteration</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1317-1336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The geochemical characteristics of abyssal peridotite samples from one dredge station ($27^\circ 49.74^\prime S, 65^\circ 02.14^\prime E$, water depth 4473 m) on the super slow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) near $65^\circ E$ were investigated. Abyssal peridotites recovered from this site were comprised mainly of lizardite, chlorite, carbonate and magnetite with minor amounts of talc, pyroxene phenocrysts and sparse olivines.</p>
					<p>Serpentinites exhibit talc veins and major serpentine derived from serpentinization with relict olivine granuloblasts. Olivine grains in serpentinites display exsolution lamellae, indicating the occurrence of talc reduction or decompression during seawaterârock interaction. Pyroxene shows clear cleavage in two directions, with clinopyroxene or orthopyroxene exsolution lamellae. By contrast, bulk rock trace element patterns of serpentinites reveal depletion in most incompatible elements, similarly to the depleted midocean ridge basalt mantle composition, indicating that the SWIR peridotites originated from a depleted mantle source magma and have experienced partial melting. Meanwhile, Rb, Ba, U, Pb, Sr, Li anomalies and the Ce/Pb ratio suggest that these serpentinites have been strongly altered by seawater.</p>

				<title>Landslide susceptibility analysis using Probabilistic Certainty Factor Approach: A case study on Tevankarai stream watershed, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1337-1350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the use of a GIS based Probabilistic Certainty Factor method to assess the geo-environmental factors that contribute to landslide susceptibility in Tevankarai Ar sub-watershed, Kodaikkanal. Landslide occurrences are a common phenomenon in the Tevankarai Ar sub-watershed, Kodaikkanal owing to rugged terrain at high altitude, high frequency of intense rainfall and rapidly expanding urban growth. The spatial database of the factors influencing landslides are compiled primarily from topographical maps, aerial photographs and satellite images. They are relief, slope, aspect, curvature, weathering, soil, land use, proximity to road and proximity to drainage. Certainty Factor Approach is used to study the interaction between the factors and the landslide, highlighting the importance of each factor in causing landslide. The results show that slope, aspect, soil and proximity to roads play important role in landslide susceptibility. The landslide susceptibility map is classified into five susceptible classes â low, very low, uncertain, high and very high â 93.32% of the study area falls under the stable category and 6.34% falls under the highly and very highly unstable category. The relative landslide density index (R index) is used to validate the landslide susceptibility map. R index increases with the increase in the susceptibility class. This shows that the factors selected for the study and susceptibility mapping using certainty factor are appropriate for the study area. Highly unstable zones show intense anthropogenic activities like high density settlement areas, and busy roads connecting the hill town and the plains.</p>

				<title>Deterministic seismic hazard macrozonation of India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1351-1364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Earthquakes are known to have occurred in Indian subcontinent from ancient times. This paper presents the results of seismic hazard analysis of India ($6^\circ â38^\circ N$ and $68^\circ â98^\circ E$) based on the deterministic approach using latest seismicity data (up to 2010). The hazard analysis was done using two different source models (linear sources and point sources) and 12 well recognized attenuation relations considering varied tectonic provinces in the region. The earthquake data obtained from different sources were homogenized and declustered and a total of 27,146 earthquakes of moment magnitude 4 and above were listed in the study area. The sesismotectonic map of the study area was prepared by considering the faults, lineaments and the shear zones which are associated with earthquakes of magnitude 4 and above. A new program was developed in MATLAB for smoothing of the point sources. For assessing the seismic hazard, the study area was divided into small grids of size $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ $ (approximately $10 \times 10$ km), and the hazard parameters were calculated at the center of each of these grid cells by considering all the seismic sources within a radius of 300 to 400 km. Rock level peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) and spectral accelerations for periods 0.1 and 1 s have been calculated for all the grid points with a deterministic approach using a code written in MATLAB. Epistemic uncertainty in hazard definition has been tackled within a logic-tree framework considering two types of sources and three attenuation models for each grid point. The hazard evaluation without logic tree approach also has been done for comparison of the results. The contour maps showing the spatial variation of hazard values are presented in the paper.</p>

				<title>Ninety million years of orogenesis, 250 million years of quiescence and further orogenesis with no change in PT: Significance for the role of deformation in porphyroblast growth</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1365-1399</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>\textit {In situ} dating of monazite grains preserved as inclusions within foliations defining FIAs (foliation inflection/intersection axes preserved within porphyroblasts) contained within garnet, staurolite, andalusite and cordierite porphyroblasts provides a chronology of ages that matches the FIA succession for the Big Thompson region of the northern Colorado Rocky Mountains. FIA sets 1, 2 and 3 trending NEâSW, EâW and SEâNW were formed at $1760.5 \pm 9.7, 1719.7 \pm 6.4$ and $1674 \pm 11$ Ma, respectively. For three samples where garnet first grew during just one of each of these FIAs, the intersection of Ca, Mg, and Fe isopleths in their cores indicate that these rocks never got above 4 kbars throughout the Colorado Orogeny. Furthermore, they remained around approximately the same depth for $\sim $250 million years to the onset of the younger Berthoud Orogeny at $1415 \pm 16$ Ma when the pressure decreased slightly as porphyroblasts formed with inclusion trails preserving FIA set 4 trending NNEâSSW. No porphyroblast growth occurred during the intervening $\sim $250 million years of quiescence, even though the PT did not change over this period. This confirms microstructural evidence gathered over the past 25 years that crenulation deformation at the scale of a porphyroblast is required for reactions to re-initiate and enable further growth.</p>

				<title>Metallogenic epoch of the Jiapigou gold belt, Jilin Province, China: Constrains from rare earth element, fluid inclusion geochemistry and geochronology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1401-1420</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Jiapigou gold belt is located on the northern margin of the North China Craton, and is one of the most important gold-mining and production regions in the circum-Pacific metallogenic zone. Research has been conducted in this area since the 1960s, however, the timing of the gold mineralisation is still unresolved, and an ideal metallogenic model has not been well established. To address these questions, a systematic geological, geochemical and geochronological investigation was conducted. The study revealed that (i) the gold-bearing quartz veins can be divided into two groups, earlier and later gold-bearing quartz veins according to their occurrence and the geochemical characteristics, (ii) the geochemical characteristics of the ore bodies, while similar to granite, are clearly different from the altered rock, and (iii) the geochemical characteristics of the later gold-bearing quartz veins have more similarity to the altered rock than the earlier gold-bearing quartz veins do. Therefore, we conclude that two independent stages of metallogenesis within the Jiapigou gold deposit area are related to magmatic activity in the Palaeoproterozoic and the Yanshanian stage of the Mesozoic, that the ore-forming fluids are mainly of magmatic origin, and that magma contamination by the altered rock was stronger in the Mesozoic. Zircon LAâICPâMS UâPb data show that the age of the Palaeoproterozoic granite is $\sim $2426.0 Ma and that of the Mesozoic granite is $\sim $166.2 Ma; these ages can be interpreted as the maximum ages of the two periods of gold mineralisation. In addition to investigating the geotectonic and regional structure of the Jiapigou gold belt, this study also proposes that the WNW-trending zone of gold mineralization is a result of a magmatic event within the basement in the early Palaeoproterozoic, and that largescale sinistral strike-slip displacements of the Huifahe and Liangjiang Faults in the late Middle Triassic (Yanshanian epoch) controlled the later tectono-magmatic event and the NNEâENE-trending zone of gold mineralisation.</p>

				<title>Simultaneous estimation of earthquake source parameters and crustal \textit {Q} value from broadband data of selected aftershocks of the 2001 \textit {M_w} 7.7 Bhuj earthquake</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1421-1440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the simultaneous estimation of source parameters and crustal Q values for small to moderate-size aftershocks (\textit {M_w} 2.1â5.1) of the \textit {M_w} 7.7 2001 Bhuj earthquake. The horizontal-component S-waves of 144 well located earthquakes (2001â2010) recorded at 3â10 broadband seismograph sites in the Kachchh Seismic Zone, Gujarat, India are analyzed, and their seismic corner frequencies, long-period spectral levels and crustal \textit {Q} values are simultaneously estimated by inverting the horizontal component of the S-wave displacement spectrum using the LevenbergâMarquardt nonlinear inversion technique, wherein the inversion scheme is formulated based on the $\omega $-square source spectral model. The static stress drops ($\Delta \sigma $) are then calculated from the corner frequency and seismic moment.</p>
					<p>The estimated source parameters suggest that the seismic moment (\textit {M_0}) and source radius (\textit {r}) of aftershocks are varying from $1.12 \times 10^{12} to 4.00 \times 10^{16}$ N-m and 132.57 to 513.20 m, respectively. Whereas, estimated stress drops ($\Delta \sigma $) and multiplicative factor (\textit {E_{mo}) values range from 0.01 to 20.0 MPa and 1.05 to 3.39, respectively. The corner frequencies are found to be ranging from 2.36 to 8.76 Hz. The crustal S-wave quality factor varies from 256 to 1882 with an average of 840 for the Kachchh region, which agrees well with the crustal \textit {Q} value of the seismically active New Madrid region, USA. Our estimated stress drop values are quite large compared to the other similar size Indian intraplate earthquakes, which can be attributed to the presence of crustal mafic intrusives and aqueous fluids in the lower crust as revealed by the earlier tomographic study of the region.</p>

				<title>Multivariate erosion risk assessment of lateritic badlands of Birbhum (West Bengal, India): A case study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1441-1454</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Each geomorphic hazard involves a degree of risk which incorporates quantification of the probability that a hazard will be harmful. At present, the categorization of sub-watersheds into erosion risk is considered as the fundamental step to conserve the soil loss. Development of badlands over the laterites of Birbhum district is an indicative of excessive soil loss in the monsoonal wet-dry type of climate. Slope erosion and channel erosion have generated huge amount of sediment from the small watersheds during intense monsoonal rainfall (JuneâSeptember). The adjoining areas of Rampurhat I Block, Birbhum (West Bengal) and Shikaripara Block, Dumka (Jharkhand) have lost the lateritic soil cover at a rate of 20â40 ton/ha/year (Sarkar \textit {et al}. 2005). In order to estimate the progressive removal of soil particles from the gully-catchments of the above-mentioned area, different morphometric parameters, soil parameters, hydrologic parameters and empirical models are employed. Side by side, the study is carried out to categorize the gully-catchments into different magnitude of erosion risk using several multivariate statistical techniques.</p>

				<page>1455-1468</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Characterization of the shear zone with poleâpole electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was carried out to explore deep groundwater potential zone in a water scarce granitic area. As existing field conditions does not always allow to plant the remote electrodes at sufficiently far of distance, the effect of insufficient distance of remote electrodes on apparent resistivity measurement was studied and shown that the transverse poleâpole array affects less compared to the collinear poleâpole array. Correction factor have been computed for transverse poleâpole array for various positions of the remote electrodes. The above results helped in exploring deep aquifer site, where a 270 m deep well was drilled. Temporal hydro-chemical samples collected during the pumping indicated the hydraulic connectivity between the demarcated groundwater potential fractures. Incorporating all the information derived from different investigations, a subsurface model was synthetically simulated and generated 2D electrical resistivity response for different arrays and compared with the field responses to further validate the geoelectrical response of deep aquifer set-up associated with lineament.</p>

In view of the importance of biomass estimates in the global carbon (C) cycle, the present study demonstrates the potential of the standwise tree outside forest inventory data and finer spatial resolution of IRS-P6 LISS-IV satellite data to classify TOF, to estimate above-ground TOF phytomass and the carbon content of TOF in a semiarid region of the southern Haryana, India. The study reports that above-ground TOF phytomass varied from 1.26 tons/ha in the scattered trees in the rural/urban area to 91.5 tons/ha in the dense linear TOF along the canal. The total above-ground TOF phytomass and carbon content was calculated as 367.04 and 174.34 tons/ha, respectively in the study area. The study results conclude that the classification of TOF and estimation of phytomass and carbon content in TOF can be successfully achieved through the combined approach of Remote Sensing and GIS based spatial technique with the supplement of field data. The present approach will help to find out the potential carbon sequestration zone in the semi-arid region of southern Haryana, India.</p>

				<title>An assessment of the FlowCapt acoustic sensor for measuring snowdrift in the Indian Himalayas</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1483-1491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wind caused snow drifting plays a dominant role in the redistribution of snow mass that restructures a snowpack. Strong wind activity at the mountain tops results in uneven distribution of snow with erosion on windward side and deposition on leeward areas. Such snowdrift events are responsible for the formation of cornices, increase in the loading of avalanche release zones on the leeward side and consequent increase in the level of avalanche hazard. In this paper, we present the results of snowdrift measurement using an acoustic snow-drift meter, the FlowCapt, built by IAV Engineering, which was used during winter seasons of 2007â2010 at a field research station of Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) in the western Himalayas. The aim of the study was to evaluate the suitability of the instrument in measuring snowdrift in the Himalayan weather conditions. Results proved the utility of the instrument as a useful tool to study drifting snow in remote areas. However, in the absence of conventional snow gauges for validation, the quality of the absolute snow flux data could not be ascertained.</p>

				<title>The assessment of geodiversity â a premise for declaring the geopark Buz$\breve{a} $ului County (Romania)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1493-1500</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The geopark Buz$\breve{a} $ului County does not belong to the Geoparks European Network, as there are numerous governmental, legislative and scientific initiatives in this respect. The geopark is situated in the central-south-eastern part of Romania (in Buzau county) and it has a special potential of geological, geomorphological, biogeographical and anthropic nature, a potential which has to be developed and brought into value. The idea of creating a geopark in this area is relatively recent and it was realized by a series of actions carried on by local authorities in partnership with several institutions, a partnership within which it was accomplished the proposal of a general development framework of the geopark, as well as the launching of a promotion campaign. The scope of this work is to evaluate the geodiversity existing in this space as an important starting point in declaring it as a European geopark, being known that it represents a real âopen air museumâ. The high values of geodiversity and biodiversity represent special strong points in this respect. The method we used was taken from the specialised literature, suffering a series of adjustments to the specifics of the studied area.</p>
					<p>In the present format, the method is applied for the first time in the Geography literature, so the values obtained cannot be compared with those obtained by other calculation formulas. Thus, values between 0.20 and 1.91 which resulted cover the entire scale of variables proposed.</p>

				<title>Prediction of monthly mean daily global solar radiation using Artificial Neural Network</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1501-1510</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, a multilayer feed forward (MLFF) neural network based on back propagation algorithm was developed, trained, and tested to predict monthly mean daily global radiation in Tamil Nadu, India. Various geographical, solar and meteorological parameters of three different locations with diverse climatic conditions were used as input parameters. Out of 565 available data, 530 were used for training and the rest were used for testing the artificial neural network (ANN). A 3-layer and a 4-layer MLFF networks were developed and the performance of the developed models was evaluated based on mean bias error, mean absolute percentage error, root mean squared error and Studentâs \textit {t}-test. The 3-layer MLFF network developed in this study did not give uniform results for the three chosen locations. Hence, a 4-layer MLFF network was developed and the average value of the mean absolute percentage error was found to be 5.47%. Values of global radiation obtained using the model were in excellent agreement with measured values. Results of this study show that the designed ANN model can be used to estimate monthly mean daily global radiation of any place in Tamil Nadu where measured global radiation data are not available.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Simultaneous photometric measurements of the OI 557.7 nm and OH (7, 2) band from a low latitude station, Kolhapur ($16.8^\circ N, 74.2^\circ E$) during the period 2004â2007 are analyzed to study the dominant waves present in the 80â100 km altitude region of the atmosphere. The nocturnal intensity variations of different airglow emissions are observed using scanning temperature controlled filter photometers. Waves having period lying between 2 and 12 hours have been recorded. Some of these waves having subharmonic tidal oscillation periods 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours propagate upward with velocity lying in the range 1.6â11.3 m/s and the vertical wave length lying between 28.6 and 163 kms. The other waves may be the upward propagating gravity waves or waves resulting from the interaction of inter-mode tidal oscillations, interaction of tidal waves with planetary waves and gravity waves. Some times, the second harmonic wave has higher vertical velocity than the corresponding fundamental wave. Application of these waves in studying the thermal structure of the region is discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A critical analysis made on the long-term monthly, seasonal, yearly variation and annual cycle of total column ozone (TCO) concentration at New Delhi ($29^\circ N, 77^\circ E$), India and Halley Bay ($76^\circ S, 27^\circ W$), a British Antarctic Service Station reveals more decline in yearly mean ozone concentration at Halley Bay than at New Delhi from 1979 to 2005. The nature of variations of monthly mean TCO during the months of August and September was the most identical with that of yearly mean ozone values at New Delhi and Halley Bay, respectively, for the same period. Annual cycles of TCO over these stations are completely different for the above period. The effect of $O_3$ depletion on night airglow emission of OH(8, 3) line at New Delhi and Halley Bay has been studied. Calculations based on chemical kinetics show that the airglow intensity of OH(8, 3) has also been affected due to the depletion of $O_3$ concentration. The yearly variations and annual cycle of intensities of OH(8, 3) line for the above two stations are depicted and compared. It has been shown that the rate of decrease of intensity of OH(8, 3) line was comparatively more at Halley Bay due to dramatic decrease of Antarctic $O_3$ concentration.</p>

				<title>Present and future water resources in India: Insights from satellite remote sensing and a dynamic global vegetation model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0013</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>India is a country of particular interest with regard to its future water resources, as it is expected to undergo continued rapid population growth while also being especially sensitive to climate change. The Land-surface Processes and eXchanges Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPX-DGVM) is used here to simulate present and future runoff in India using ClimGen pattern-scaled scenarios of $1^\circ , 2^\circ $ and $4^\circ C$ temperature increase (scaled to 2050) forced by six general circulation models (GCMs). As is the case with many DGVMs, groundwater storage is not simulated by LPX, so in order to form a more comprehensive understanding of water resources, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite estimates for north-west India are incorporated into this study and compared to LPX runoff simulations. Runoff is simulated to have increased slightly (1.5 mm/year) in this region during 2002â2006, while groundwater extractions appear to have been made at rates of $40 \pm 10$ mm/year.</p>
					<p>North-west India is simulated to experience considerable increases in runoff by 2070â2099, with a mean change of 189 mm/year for $2^\circ C$ climate change (although the range of model results, 247 mm/year, demonstrates high uncertainty among GCMs). Precipitation is shown to have an important bearing on runoff generation, while the degree of warming is shown to affect the magnitude of future runoff. This may subsequently influence the longevity of the local groundwater resource. However, at recent rates of depletion and in view of expected population growth, the long-term sustainability of groundwater reserves in north-west India is in doubt.</p>

				<title>Investigation of sulphate origins in the Jeffara aquifer, southeastern Tunisia: A geochemical approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0015-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chemical composition of groundwater within the multilayer Jeffara aquifer and the detailed analysis of saturation indices enables identification of the origin of mineralization and hydrogeochemical processes occurring in groundwater. It has been demonstrated that groundwater is mainly characterized by a CaâMgâSO4âCl water type. Geochemical pattern is controlled by the dissolution of evaporites, largely abundant in the study area and incongruent dissolution of dolomite. Gypsum, anhydrite, mirabilite and thenardite have been examined as potential sources of sulphate dissolved in groundwater. Since Jeffara groundwater is recharged by the Continental Intercalaire (CI) geothermal water, water temperature decreases from the CI to the Jeffara aquifer. Solubility of the majority of minerals is modified by this change in temperature and thus a mixing process of thermal and non-thermal waters was examined.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The region under investigation for groundwater exploration is a part of the eastern fringe of Deccan traps in Kalmeshwar Taluk of Nagpur district. In this region, groundwater is the main source of water supply for drinking and irrigation purposes. Presently, the known source of groundwater is the upper weathered mantle in the depth range of 8â15 m. This source of groundwater has been overexploited because of increasing demand of water supply and is unable to meet the present requirement. The present work deals with the delineation of new sources of groundwater at deeper levels concealed within and below the traps by using vertical electrical sounding surveys in order to meet the increasing demand of water supply.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0043-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Najafgarh drain is the biggest drain in Delhi and contributes about 60% of the total wastewater that gets discharged from Delhi into river Yamuna. The drain traverses a length of 51 km before joining river Yamuna, and is unlined for about 31 km along its initial stretch. In recent times, efforts have been made for limited withdrawal of groundwater from shallow aquifers in close vicinity of Najafgarh drain coupled with artificial recharge of groundwater. In this perspective, assessment of groundwater quality in shallow aquifers in vicinity of the Najafgarh drain of Delhi and hydrogeological characterization of adjacent areas were done. The groundwater quality was examined in perspective of Indian as well as World Health Organizationâs drinking water standards. The spatial variation in groundwater quality was studied. The linkages between trace element occurrence and hydrochemical facies variation were also established. The shallow groundwater along Najafgarh drain is contaminated in stretches and the area is not suitable for large-scale groundwater development for drinking water purposes.</p>

				<title>Geochemical assessment of light gaseous hydrocarbons in near-surface soils of KutchâSaurashtra: Implication for hydrocarbon prospects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0055-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Light hydrocarbons in soil have been used as direct indicators in geochemical hydrocarbon exploration, which remains an unconventional path in the petroleum industry. The occurrence of adsorbed soil gases, methane and heavier homologues were recorded in the near-surface soil samples collected from KutchâSaurashtra, India. Soil gas alkanes were interpreted to be derived from deep-seated hydrocarbon sources and have migrated to the surface through structural discontinuities. The source of hydrocarbons is assessed to be thermogenic and could have been primarily derived from humic organic matter with partial contribution from sapropelic matter. Gas chromatographic analyses of hydrocarbons desorbed from soil samples through acid extraction technique showed the presence of methane through \textit {n}-butane and the observed concentrations (in ppb) vary from: methane ($C_1$) from 4â291, ethane ($C_2$) from 0â84, propane ($C_3$) from 0â37, i-butane ($iC_4$) from 0â5 and \textit {n}-butane ($nC_4$) from 0â4. Carbon isotopes measured for methane and ethane by GC-C-IRMS, range between â42.9â° to â13.3â° (Pee Dee Belemnite â PDB) and â21.2â°_ to â12.4â° (PDB), respectively. The increased occurrence of hydrocarbons in the areas near Anjar of Kutch and the area south to Rajkot of Saurashtra signifies the area potential for oil and gas.</p>

The geochemical plot suggests that both dacite/rhyolite and andesite probably have a common origin as in many of the geochemical plots, these two groups form a similar trend. Volcanic rocks have a transitional geochemical character between tholeiite and calc alkaline on a Y versus Zr plot. $(La/Yb)_N$ versus La and $TiO_2$ versus Zr modelling show that the crystallization of both granitic and volcanic magmas are controlled by a different set of minerals. The rare earth elements (REE) patterns of some of the granite and volcanic samples have pronounced negative Eu anomaly indicating plagioclase fractionation. The difference between both profiles is that the granite samples show a concave shape profile which is consistent with liquids produced by partial melting of quartz feldspathic rocks containing amphibole among the residual phase. Both magmas were generated at a different time during the subduction of Sibumasu beneath the Indochina blocks.</p>

				<title>Platinum group elements geochemistry of ultramafic and associated rocks from Pindar in Madawara Igneous Complex, Bundelkhand massif, central India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0079-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ultramafic rocks comprising dunite, harburgite, lehzolite, olivine webserite and websterite occur as intrusives in the form of small hillocks at around Pindar into the graniteâgneisses of Bundelkhand Gneissic Complex (BnGC). The peridotites are dominated by olivine cumulates where chromite and precious metal-bearing sulphides crystallized along with pyroxenes, subsequent to crystallization of olivine into the interstitial spaces of cumulates during cooling. Ultramafic rocks of Pindar are characterized by high MgO (up to 46.0 wt%) and FeO (up to 5.8 wt%); low $SiO_2$ (40.8 to 48.0 wt%), $TiO_2$ (0.2 to 0.5 wt%), $Al_{2}O_{3} (\sim 3.2$ wt% av.), CaO ($\sim $ 2.7 wt% av.) and Cu (11 to 73 $\mu $g/g). Cr and Ni values range from 2297 to 3150 $\mu $g/g and 2434 to 2767 $\mu $g/g, respectively. Distribution of Ir (up to 20 ng/g), Ru (27 to 90 ng/g), Rh (3 to 14 ng/g), Pt (18 to 72 ng/g), Pd (10 to 27 ng/g) and Au (22 to 57 ng/g) indicate platinum group element (PGE) and associated gold mineralization in these ultramafic rocks. A mineral phase representing sperrylite ($PtAs_2$) was also identified within the sulphides in Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometer (SEMâEDS) studies. The primitive mantle-normalized siderophile elements pattern shows platinum group element PGE (PPGE) enrichment (Rh, Pt, Pd). Discrimination diagrams of Pd/Ir vs. Ni/Cu, Pd/Pt vs. Ni/Cu, Cu/Pd vs. Pd, and Cu vs. Pd for the peridotites of Pindar attribute to affinity towards komatiite magma, derived from high degree of partial melting of prolonged depleted mantle, and the sulphur saturation condition incurred during the crystallization of chromite which was favourable for PGE mineralization.</p>

				<title>A field technique for rapid lithological discrimination and ore mineral identification: Results from Mamandur Polymetal Deposit, India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0093-0106</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work illustrates the efficiency of field spectroscopy for rapid identification of minerals in ore body, alteration zone and host rocks. The adopted procedure involves collection of field spectra, their processing for noise, spectral matching and spectral un-mixing with selected library end-members. Average weighted spectral similarity and effective peak matching techniques were used to draw end-members from library. Constrained linear mixture modelling technique was used to convolve end-member spectra. Linear mixture model was optimized based on root mean square error between field- and modelled-spectra. Estimated minerals and their abundances were subsequently compared with conventional procedures such as petrography, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence for accuracy assessment. The mineralized zone is found to contain azurite, galena, chalcopyrite, bornite, molybdenite, marcacite, gahnite, hematite, goethite, anglesite and malachite. The alteration zone contains chlorite, kaolinite, actinolite and mica. These mineral assemblages correlate well with the petrographic measurements (\textit {R^2} = 0.89). Subsequently, the bulk chemistry of field samples was compared with spectroscopically derived cumulative weighted mineral chemistry and found to correlate well (\textit {R^2} = 0.91â0.98) at excellent statistical significance levels (90â99%). From this study, it is evident that field spectroscopy can be effectively used for rapid mineral identification and abundance estimation.</p>

				<title>Intensity attenuation relation at ChambaâGarhwal area in north-west Himalaya with epicentral distance and magnitude</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0107-0122</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seismic hazard assessment of any region depends on the attenuation relation which relates the seismological data with parameters of engineering interest. In the absence of sufficient strong motion data for northwest Himalayan region, isoseismal maps of previous earthquakes were the only source of information for computing the attenuation characteristics of that region. The northwest Himalayan region had experienced major and moderate earthquakes in the past and isoseismal maps had been developed by various authors for each of these earthquakes representing intensity pattern and decay of intensity in different directions. With this information, attenuation relations of intensity with distance can be obtained. The present study includes 10 moderate and major earthquakes (\textit {M_s} $\geq 4.9$) that had occurred during the last 100 years. These are primarily Kangra (1905), Chamba-1 (1945), Chamba-2 (1995), Kinnaur (1975), Dharamsala (1986), Uttar Kashi (1991), Garhwal-1 (1996), Garhwal-2 (1996), Sundarnagar (1997) and Chamoli (1999) earthquakes. Miezoseismal zones in majority of the isoseismal maps show two major directions, i.e., either the longest axis of these isoseismal maps which are aligned in NWâSE direction following the major longitudinal features or north-northwest to south-southeast direction, following the tectonic features which are transverse to the Himalayan trend. Isoseismal maps of Kangra (1905), Chamba (1945) and Uttar Kashi (1991) earthquakes are more symmetrical and elongated in south-east direction, but compressed in north-east and north-west directions, thus indicating fast attenuation characteristics in north-east and north-west directions reflecting lithological variation. On the other hand, Sundernagar (1997) and Kinnuar (1975) earthquakes show circular pattern of intensity distribution. Combining decay patterns from different magnitude earthquakes in different directions, two attenuation relationships have been developed using regression relationship (least square method).</p>

				<title>Microtremor measurements in the northern coast of $\dot{I} $zmir Bay, Turkey to evaluate site-specific characteristics and fundamental periods by \textit {H/V} spectral ratio method</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0123-0136</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seventy-two microtremor measurements were conducted in the northern coast of $\dot{I} $zmir Bay. The dataset has been processed using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio. The fundamental period contour map obtained showed that the fundamental period at rock sites of the northern coast of $\dot{I} $zmir Bay was between 0.15 and 0.35 s. However, the fundamental period increased towards the western direction where thick soft sediments exist, the fundamental period varied between 0.5 and 2.0 s. A soil classification map of the area was prepared based on the data estimated from SPT-\textit {N} values of 25 boreholes. It is seen that major portion of the study area, including the shore line of the northern coast had SPT-\textit {N} values lower than 15. The fundamental periods obtained by \textit {H/V} spectral ratio method and the periods derived from shear wave velocity data available in 11 of 25 boreholes were well-correlated. Fundamental period map obtained from \textit {H/V} spectral ratio method illustrated the characteristics of weak soil conditions and the presence of bedrock level under thick alluvial soils. Finally, microtremor investigations have proved to be an effective tool for assessment of local soil conditions in case of thick soft sediments in the northern coast of $\dot{I} $zmir Bay.</p>

				<title>Tectonic shortening and coeval volcanism during the Quaternary, Northeast Japan arc</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0137-0147</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Northeast Japan arc, a mature volcanic arc with a back-arc marginal basin (Japan Sea), is located on a convergent plate boundary along the subducting Pacific plate and the overriding North American plate. From a compilation and analysis of stratigraphy, radiometric age and data on erupted magma volumes, 176 eruptive episodes identified from 69 volcanoes so far, indicate that notable changes in eruption style, magma discharge rates and distribution of eruptive centres occurred around 1.0 Ma. Before ca.1.0 Ma, large-volume felsic eruptions were dominant, forming large calderas in the frontal arc, a region of low crustal strain rate. After ca. 1.0 Ma to the present, the calc-alkaline andesite magma eruptions in the frontal and rear arcs, synchronous with crustal shortening characterized by reverse faulting, resulted in stratovolcano development along narrow uplifted zones. Although, it is widely assumed that magma cannot rise easily in a compressional setting, some of the magma stored within basal sills could be extruded where NâS-trending uplifted mountains bounded by reverse faults formed since about ca.1.0 Ma.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Five species of \textit {Steginoporella} from the Palaeogene rocks of the Western Kachchh, Gujarat are described in this paper. Out of five steginoporellids, \textit {S. mathuri} n.sp., \textit {S. murachbanensis} n.sp. and \textit {S. chiplonkari} n.sp. are new to science; \textit {S. bhujensis} is already reported from this region; and \textit {Steginoporella} sp. indet is reported for the first time in these rocks. All these species show Indo-Pacific affinities. The occurrence of \textit {Steginoporella} from Middle Eocene to Early Miocene indicates that two stages of radiation had taken place in Kachchh. Phylogenetic analysis using PAST programme indicates that \textit {S. mathuri} is very distinct from other species of \textit {Steginoporella}; while \textit {S. murachbanensis} and \textit {S. bhujensis} form the same clade.</p>

				<title>Late Paleoceneâearly Eocene carbon isotope stratigraphy from a near-terrestrial tropical section and antiquity of Indian mammals</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0163-0171</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Late Paleocene to early Eocene ($\sim $56 to 51 Ma) interval is characterized by five distinct transient warming (hyperthermal) events (PaleoceneâEocene thermal maximum (PETM), H1/ETM2/ELMO, H2, I1 and I2) in a super greenhouse globe associated with negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs). Although well-documented marine records exist at different latitudes, terrestrial PETM sections are rare. In particular, almost no terrestrial records of either the PETM or early Eocene hyperthermals (EEHs) are yet available from the tropics. Further, evolution of modern order of mammals near the PETM has been recorded in many northern continents; however, the response of mammals in the tropics to these warming events is unknown. A tropical terrestrial record of these hyperthermal/CIE events, encompassing the earliest modern order mammal bearing horizon from India, can therefore be vital in understanding climatic and biotic evolution during the earliest Cenozoic time. Here, for the first time, we report high resolution carbon isotope ($\delta ^{13}C$) stratigraphy, nannofossil, and Sr isotope ratio of marine fossil carbonate from the Cambay Shale Formation of Western India. The record shows complete preservation of all the above CIE events, including the PETM, hitherto unknown from the equatorial terrestrial records. $\delta ^{13}C$ chemostratigraphy further suggests that at least the present early Eocene mammal-bearing horizon, recently discovered at Vastan, does not support the âout of Indiaâ hypothesis of earliest appearance of modern mammals and subsequent dispersal to the Holarctic continents.</p>

				<title>Paleoenvironmental significance of clay mineral assemblages in the southeastern Arabian Sea during last 30 kyr</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0173-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A gravity core SK-221 recovered from the southeastern Arabian Sea near LaccadiveâChagos Ridge was examined to identify the sources of detrital clay minerals and to decipher paleoenvironmental changes for the last 30 kyr. The clay mineral assemblages predominantly consist of illite, kaolinite and chlorite with small amounts of smectite. Quartz, feldspar and occasionally gibbsite are the clay-sized non-clay minerals present in the examined section. The detrital clay minerals primarily originated from the hinterland and were supplied to the present site by the numerous small rivers draining western India during preglacial and Holocene periods, and partly by the strong reworking of Indian continental shelf during glacial period. The low values of humidity proxies (kaolinite content, kaolinite to illite and smectite to illite ratios) and better illite crystallinity indicate relatively weak summer monsoon condition that resulted in reduced chemical weathering during glacial period, which was interrupted by a discrete event of winter monsoon intensification at $\sim $20â17 ka. The increased kaolinite content, higher values of humidity indices and poorer illite crystallinity reflect high humidity that resulted in strong hydrolysis activity during the preglacial and Holocene periods. The increased $CaCO_3$ during above periods also indicates less terrigenous dilution and intensified southwest monsoon-led upwelling which result in higher surface biogenic productivity. The characteristic clay mineral associations broadly suggest dry to semi-drier conditions during Heinrich Events H1, H2, and H3 and also during Younger Dryas. The low values of biogenic carbonate and organic carbon also indicate low productivity associated with weak summer monsoons during Heinrich Events. Abrupt increased humidity was recorded at 15â12.7 ka (BÃ¸lling/AllerÃ¸d Event) sandwiched between two lows of Heinrich Events. Cycles of millennial timescale variations 2300, 1800, 1300 and 1000 yr have been observed from the clay mineralogical data. All the cycles observed in the monsoonal climate appear to be part of global oscillations.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of OSCAR ocean surface current product in the tropical Indian Ocean using \textit {in situ} data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0187-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The OSCAR (ocean surface current analysis real-time),which is a product derived from various satellite observations,has been evaluated in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO)in two di ï¬erent ways.First,the OSCAR-derived monthly climatology has been compared with available drifter-derived climatology in the TIO.From the comparison of the two climatologies,one can infer that OSCAR product is able to capture the variabilities of the well-known surface current systems in the TIO reasonably well.Fourier analysis of the major current systems,as reproduced by OSCAR,shows that the dominant annual and semiannual periodicities,known to exist in these systems,have been faithfully picked up by OSCAR. Next,the evaluation has been carried out by comparing the OSCAR currents with currents measured by moored buoys.The zonal component of OSCAR-current is in good agreement with corresponding component of buoy-observed current with a correlation exceeding 0.7,while the match between the meridional components is poorer.The locations of the peaks of the mean and eddy kinetic energies are matching in both the climatologies,although the peak in the drifter climatology is stronger than the same in the OSCAR product.Finally,an important feature of Indian Ocean circulation,namely the reverse Wyrtki jet,occurring during anomalous dipole years,has been well-reproduced by OSCAR currents.</p>

				<title>AIRS observations of seasonal variability in meridional temperature gradient over Indian region at 100 hPa</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0201-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To investigate the temperature changes at 100 hPa over Indian region from Arabian Sea (AS) to Bay of Bengal (BOB), analysis is performed using Atmospheric Infra Red Sounder (AIRS) temperature and outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) data of 9 years (2003â2011). Fine-scale temperature variations have been studied and shown for summer (MarchâAprilâMay, MAM), summer monsoon (JuneâJulyâAugustâSeptember, JJAS) and winter (NovemberâDecemberâJanuaryâFebruary, NDJF) months. Similarities and differences in the latitudinal and longitudinal variation of temperature and the possible causes have been examined. During MAM and NDJF, the temperature increases latitudinally by $\sim $2â3 K and $\sim $4â5 K from $3.5^\circ to 20.5^\circ N$, respectively. However, the temperature decreases by $\sim $2.0â2.5 K during JJAS. A similar contrasting behaviour is observed in latitudinal temperature gradient. For MAM and NDJF, the gradient decreases from $\sim $0.18 to $\sim $0.14 K/deg and $\sim $0.25 to $\sim $0.18 K/deg, respectively, as we move longitudinally from $60^\circ to 90^\circ E$; however, for JJAS, it increases from $\sim $0.10 to $\sim $0.14 K/deg over the same longitudes. It is found that latitudinal temperature gradient for NDJF is larger by about a factor of 1.5. Analysis suggests latitudinal change in temperature occurs due to low OLR (proxy of convection) and its northward progression during summer monsoon. Correlation coefficient (\textit {R}_xy) between OLR and temperature is computed latitudinally ($3.5^\circ to 20.5^\circ N$) at different longitudes and during JJAS (monsoon months), \textit {R}_xy is negative ($\sim $â0.73) over $60^\circ $ and $70^\circ E$ longitudes, but it turns positive ($\sim $0.92) over $80^\circ $ and $90^\circ E$ longitudes (which is convectively active region), suggesting a close association between low temperature and low OLR. Landâsea contrast is also observed in temperature at 100 hPa with a slight increase ($\sim $0.5 K) from sea to land.</p>

				<title>Recent temperature trends at mountain stations on the southern slope of the central Himalayas</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0215-0227</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Insufficient long-term \textit {in situ} observations and complex topographic conditions pose major problems in quantifying the magnitude of climatic trends in mountainous regions such as Nepal. Presented here is three decades (1980â2009) of data on annual maximum, minimum and average temperature trends from 13 mountain stations on the southern slope of the central Himalayas. The stations are located at elevations between 1304 and 2566 m above sea level and with varied topography. Spatial analyses of the average temperature trend show warming in most of the stations. The magnitude of warming is higher for maximum temperatures, while minimum temperatures exhibit larger variability such as positive, negative or no change. These results are consistent with patterns reported in some parts of the Indian subcontinent and Upper Indus Basin, but different from conditions on the Tibetan Plateau (China), where the warming of minimum temperatures is more prominent than that of the maximum temperatures. From the temporal variations, a dramatic increase in temperature is observed in the latest decade, particularly in the average and maximum temperatures. The results from the cumulative sum chart analyses suggest that the thermal regime shifted in 1997. The dramatic enhancement of average temperature in the last decade is strongly consistent with the result of contemporary studies of the surrounding regions, where warming is attributed to an increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases. However, as in the western Himalayas and the Upper Indus Basin, the mountain stations on the southern slope of the central Himalayas show variability in temperature trends, particularly for the minimum temperature. This inhomogeneous trend is likely ascribed to the differences in topography and microclimatic regime of the observed stations.</p>

				<title>Air ion and pollution index variation for indoor and outdoor atmosphere at rural station Ramanandnagar ($17^\circ 4^\prime N,74^\circ 25^\prime $) India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0229-0237</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the observation of indoor air ion concentration at a rural site has been carried out for the first time. These indoor observations are compared with outdoor air ion concentration. Net charge can be introduced into the atmosphere by processes such as combustion, rainfall and ultraviolet radiation. As compared to indoors, average air ions of both the polarities at outdoors are higher. Moreover, the air ion concentrations, experience large fluctuations during daytime, as compared to nighttime values. Positive and negative air ion concentrations are lower and uniform throughout the night both for indoor and outdoor conditions. Pollution index is more or less unity for outdoors in all-the-time period, which is good for human health. Due to limited sources of air ions indoors, it is observed that pollution index decreases from 00:00â02:00 hours and minimum is reached during 12:00â14:00 hours for indoors. During 00:00â02:00 hours, the indoor pollution index is 1.55, which is very harmful to human health.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A critical analysis has been made on the contribution of CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, $CH_{3}Cl, CH_{3}Br, CCl_{4}, CH_{3}CCl_{3}$, HCFCs, halons, WMO (World Meteorological Organization) minor constituents, $CH_{4}, N_{2}O$ and water vapour to the variation of total column ozone (TCO) concentration at the station in Srinagar ($34^\circ N, 74.8^\circ E$), India from 1992 to 2003. With the implementation of Montreal Protocol, though the concentrations of CFC-11, CFC-113, $CH_{3}Cl, CH_{3}Br, CCl_{4}$ and $CH_{3}CCl_{3}$ had decreased, the concentrations of CFC-12, HCFCs, halons, WMO minor constituents, $CH_{4}, N_{2}O$ and water vapour had increased, as a result of which TCO had risen from 1992 to 2003 at the above station. The nature of yearly variations of concentrations of the above ozone depleting substances and greenhouse gases as well as ozone has been presented. Possible explanations for build-up of TCO have also been offered.</p>

				<title>Analysis of ENSO-based climate variability in modulating drought risks over western Rajasthan in India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0253-0269</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper investigates the role of El Ni$\tilde{n} $o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-based climate variability in modulating multivariate drought risks in the drought-prone region of Western Rajasthan in India. Droughts are multivariate phenomenon, often characterized by severity, duration and peak. By using multivariate ENSO index, annual drought events are partitioned into three climatic states â El Ni$\tilde{n} $o, La Ni$\tilde{n} $a and neutral phases. For multivariate probabilistic representation of drought characteristics, trivariate copulas are employed, which have the ability to preserve the dependence structure of drought variables under uncertain environment. The first copula model is developed without accounting the climate state information to obtain joint and conditional return periods of drought characteristics. Then, copula-based models are developed for each climate state to estimate the joint and conditional probabilities of drought characteristics under each ENSO state. Results of the study suggest that the inclusion of ENSO-based climate variability is helpful in knowing the associated drought risks, and useful for management of water resources in the region.</p>
