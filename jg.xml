				<title>Stationary-State Mutagenesis in \textit{Escherichia coli}: a Model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0007</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stationary-phase mutagenesis in nondividing \textit{E. coli} cells exposed to a nonlethal stress was, a few years ago, claimed to be a likely case of a Lamarckian mechanism capable of producing exclusively useful mutations in a directed manner. After a heated debate over the last decade it now appears to involve a Darwinian mechanism that generates a transient state of hypermutagenesis, operating on a large number of sites spread over the entire genome, at least in a proportion of the resting cells. Most of the studies that clarified this position were on the reversion of a frameshift mutation present in a \textit{lacI -- lacZ} fusion in \textit{E. coli} strain FC40. Several groups have extensively examined both the sequence changes associated with these reversions and the underlying genetic requirements. On the basis of our studies on the genomic sequence analysis, we recently proposed a model to explain the specific changes associated with the reversion hotspots. Here we propose a more detailed version of this model that also takes into account the observed genetic requirements of stationary-state mutagenesis. Briefly, G:T/U mismatches produced at methylatable cytosines are preferentially repaired in nondividing cells by the very short patch mismatch repair (VSPMR) mechanism which is itself mutagenic and can produce mutations in very short stretches located in the immediate vicinity of these cytosine methylation sites. This mechanism requires a homologous or homeologous strand invasion step and an error-prone DNA synthesis step and is dependent on RecA, RecBCD and a DNA polymerase. The process is initiated near sequences recognized by Dcm and Vsr enzymes and further stimulated if these sequences are a part of CHI or CHI-like sequences, but a double-strand-break-dependent recombination mediated by the RecBCD pathways proposed by others seems to be nonessential. The strand transfer step is proposed to depend on RecA, RuvA, RuvB and RuvC and is opposed by RecG and MutS. The model also gives interesting insights into the evolution of the \textit{E. coli} genome.</p>

				<title>Conditions for the Trivers-Willard Hypothesis to be Valid: a Minimal Population-Genetic Model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0009-0015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The very insightful Trivers-Willard hypothesis, proposed in the early 1970s, states that females in good physiological condition are more likely to produce male offspring when the variance of reproductive success among males is high. The hypothesis has inspired a number of studies over the last three decades aimed at its experimental verification, and many of them have found adequate supportive evidence in its favour. Theoretical investigations, on the other hand, have been few, perhaps because formulating a population-genetic model for describing the Trivers±Willard hypothesis turns out to be surprisingly complex. The present study is aimed at using a minimal population-genetic model to explore one specific scenario, namely how is the preference for a male offspring by females in good condition altered when $g$, the proportion of such females in the population, changes from a low to a high value. As expected, when the proportion of such females in good condition is low in the population, i.e. for low values of $g$, the Trivers-Willard (TW) strategy goes to fixation against the equal investment strategy. This holds true up to $g_\mathrm{max}$, a critical value of $g$, above which the two strategies coexist, but the proportion of the TW strategy steadily decreases as $g$ increases to unity. Similarly, when the effect of well-endowed males attaining disproportionately high number of matings is more pronounced, the TW strategy is more likely to go to fixation. Interestingly, the success of the TW strategy has a complex dependence on the variance of the physiological condition of females. If the difference in the two types of conditions is not large, TW strategy is favoured, and its success is more likely as the difference increases. However, beyond a critical value of the difference, the TW strategy is found to be less and less likely to succeed as the difference becomes larger. Possible reasons for these effects are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>During a study of deletions of Y-chromosomal DNA in infertile males, sY116, a Y-linked STS, showed different electrophoretic mobilities in three males, two infertile and one fertile. A study of this STS among 35 other normal males showed that this locus is polymorphic. sY116 has a poly A-rich stretch whose instability appears to be the most likely cause of this polymorphism. The possible usefulness of sY116 polymorphism in the detection of subtle genome-wide instabilities in some types of cancer is discussed.</p>

				<title>A spectrum of genes expressed during early stages of rice panicle and flower development</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0025-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To unravel gene expression patterns during rice inflorescence development, particularly at early stages of panicle and floral organ specification, we have characterized random cloned cDNAs from developmental-stage-specific libraries. cDNA libraries were constructed from rice panicles at the stage of branching and flower primordia specification or from panicles undergoing floral organogenesis. Partial sequence analysis and expression patterns of some of these random cDNA clones from these two rice panicle libraries are presented. Sequence comparisons with known DNA sequences in databases reveal that approximately sixtyeight per cent of these expressed rice genes show varying degrees of similarity to genes in other species with assigned functions. In contrast, thirtytwo per cent represent uncharacterized genes. cDNAs reported here code for potential rice homologues of housekeeping molecules, regulators of gene expression, and signal transduction molecules. They comprise both single-copy and multicopy genes, and genes expressed differentially, both spatially and temporally, during rice plant development. New rice cDNAs requiring specific mention are those with similarity to <i>COP1</i>, a regulator of photomorphogenesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>; sequence-specific DNA binding plant proteins like <i>AP2</i>-domain-containing factors; genes that specify positional information in shoot meristems like leucine-rich-repeat-containing receptor kinases; regulators of chromatin structure like Polycomb domain protein; and also proteins induced by abiotic stresses.</p>

				<title>The <i>p10</i> gene of <i>Bombyx mori</i> nucleopolyhedrosis virus encodes a 7.5-kDa protein and is hypertranscribed from a TAAG motif</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0033-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In baculovirus-based high-level expression of cloned foreign genes, the viral very late gene promoters of <i>polyhedrin (polh)</i> and <i>p10</i> are extensively exploited. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the <i>p10</i> gene from a local isolate of <i>Bombyx mori</i> nucleopolyhedrosis virus (BmNPV). The gene harbours a 213-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 70 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 7.5 kDa. The BmNPV <i>p10</i> showed deletion of a single A at +210 nucleotide compared to the prototype baculovirus, <i>Autographa californica</i> multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), <i>p10</i> gene, resulting in a translational frameshift to generate a termination codon and consequently a truncated polypeptide instead of the 10-kDa protein. This protein P7.5 from BmNPV has a putative leucine zipper dimerization motif towards the N-terminal end and the central nuclear disintegration domain but the carboxy-terminal domain implicated in protein association for fibrillar structure formation is absent. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <i>p10</i> is highly conserved among baculoviruses and the BmNPV strains are more closely related to AcMNPV than other baculoviruses. The transcription of <i>p10</i> is regulated in a temporal manner, reaching maximal levels by 72 h post-infection. RNAase protection and primer extension analysis mapped the transcription start sites at $-70$ and $-71$ nt with respect to the ATG, within the conserved baculovirus late gene motif T\underline{AA}G. The upstream region showed complete homology to the strong promoter of the AcMNPV <i>p10</i>, suggesting that this promoter from BmNPV could also be exploited for high-level expression of cloned foreign genes in silkworm cells or larvae.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh is home to a large number of tribal populations of diverse linguistic and ethnic backgrounds. With a view to examining how well genomic affinities among tribal populations of this state correspond with their ethnic and linguistic affinities, we analysed DNA samples of individuals drawn from five tribes with diverse, but reasonably well-documented, ethnohistorical and linguistic backgrounds. Each DNA sample was scored at 16 biallelic DNA marker loci. On the basis of these data, genomic affinities among these populations were estimated. We have found an extremely good correspondence between the genomic and ethnolinguistic affinities.</p>

				<title>An improved procedure of mapping a quantitative trait locus via the EM algorithm using posterior probabilities</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0047-0053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mapping a locus controlling a quantitative genetic trait (e.g. blood pressure) to a specific genomic region is of considerable contemporary interest. Data on the quantitative trait under consideration and several codominant genetic markers with known genomic locations are collected from members of families and statistically analysed to estimate the recombination fraction, $\theta$, between the putative quantitative trait locus and a genetic marker. One of the major complications in estimating $\theta$ for a quantitative trait in humans is the lack of haplotype information on members of families. We have devised a computationally simple two-stage method of estimation of $\theta$ in the absence of haplotypic information using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the first stage, parameters of the quantitative trait locus (QTL) are estimated on the basis of data of a sample of unrelated individuals and a Bayes's rule is used to classify each parent into a QTL genotypic class. In the second stage, we have proposed an EM algorithm for obtaining the maximum-likelihood estimate of $\theta$ based on data of informative families (which are identified upon inferring parental QTL genotypes performed in the first stage). The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether, instead of using genotypically `classified' data of parents, the use of posterior probabilities of QT genotypes of parents at the second stage yields better estimators. We show, using simulated data, that the proposed procedure using posterior probabilities is statistically more efficient than our earlier classification procedure, although it is computationally heavier.</p>

				<title>Negative regulation of <i>Ultrabithorax</i> expression by <i>engrailed</i> is required for proper specification of wing development in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0061-0070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In both vertebrates and invertebrates, homeotic selector genes confer morphological differences along the antero-posterior axis. However, insect wing development is independent of all homeotic gene functions, reflecting the ground plan of an ancestral pterygote, which bore wings on all segments. Dipteran insects such as <i>Drosophila</i> are characterized by a pair of wings in the mesothoracic segment. In all other segments, wing development is essentially repressed by different homeotic genes, although in the metathorax they are modified into a pair of halteres. This necessitates that during development all homeotic genes are to be maintained in a repressed state in wing imaginal discs. In this report we show that</p> 
					<ol type="roman">
						<li>the function of the segment polarity <i>gene engrailed</i> (en) is critical to keep the homeotic selector gene <i>Ultrabithorax</i> (<i>Ubx</i>) repressed in wing imaginal discs,</li>
						<li>normal levels of En in the posterior compartment of haltere discs, however, are not enough to completely repress <i>Ubx</i>, and</li>
						<li>the repression of <i>Ubx</i> by <i>en</i> is independent of Hedgehog signalling through which the long-range signalling of <i>en</i> is mediated during wing development.</li> 
					</ol>
					<p>Finally we provide evidence for a possible mechanism by which en represses <i>Ubx</i>. On the basis of these results we propose that <i>en</i> has acquired two independent functions during the evolution of dorsal appendages. In addition to its well-known function of conferring posterior fate and inducing long-range signalling to pattern the developing appendages, it maintains wing fate by keeping <i>Ubx</i> repressed.</p>

				<title>Expression of the gene for large subunit of m-calpain is elevated in skeletal muscle from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0077-0080</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Calpain is an intracellular nonlysosomal protease involved in essential regulatory or processing functions of the cell, mediated by physiological concentrations of Ca$^{2+}$. However, in an environment of abnormal intracellular calcium, such as that seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), calpain is suggested to cause degeneration of muscle owing to enhanced activity. To test whether the reported increase in calpain activity in DMD results from <i>de novo</i> synthesis of the protease, we have assessed the quantitative changes in mRNA specific for m-calpain. mRNA isolated from DMD and control muscle was analysed by dot blot hybridization using a cDNA probe for the large subunit of m-calpain. Compared to control a four-fold increase in specific mRNAwas observed in dystrophic muscle. This enhanced expression of the m-calpain gene in dystrophic condition suggests that the reported increase in m-calpain activity results from <i>de novo</i> synthesis of protease and underlines the important role of m-calpain in DMD.</p>

				<title>Identification of four genes involved in suppression of the pre-mRNA splicing defect in the <i>sng1-1/rhp6$^{-}$</i> mutant of fission yeast</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0083-0090</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Apart from the global regulators of silencing in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, namely <i>swi6, clr1, clr2, clr3, clr4</i> and <i>rik1</i>, the DNA repair gene <i>rhp6</i> plays a unique role in mating-type silencing. Recently, we showed that <i>sng1-1</i>, a mutation in the $5'$ splice junction of the second intron of the <i>rhp6</i> gene, leads to derepression of both the silent loci <i>mat2</i> and <i>mat3</i> in switching background. To address the mechanism of <i>rhp6</i> in silencing, we have isolated several extragenic suppressors of the <i>sng1-1/rhp6$^{-}$</i> mutation. These suppressors fall into four complementation groups and are referred to as suppressor of <i>rhp6: sur1, sur2, sur3</i> and <i>sur4</i>. Interestingly, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of the <i>rhp6</i> transcript shows that in contrast to about $\gt 50\%$ level of unspliced <i>rhp6</i> pre-mRNA in the <i>sng1-1/rhp6$^{-}$</i> mutant, there is a restoration of normal splicing to varying degrees in the suppressors. The <i>sur2</i> gene belongs to the AAA-ATPase family of proteins, with maximum homology to the SIN1-associated protein SAP1 of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We propose that <i>sur2</i>, along with <i>sur1, sur3</i> and <i>sur4</i>, may play an as yet uncharacterized role in pre-mRNA splicing.</p>

					<p>We have isolated a mutation in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisisae CDC28</i> gene that allows <i>cdc13</i> cells, carrying damaged DNA, to continue with the cell division cycle. While <i>cdc13</i> mutant cells are arrested as large-budded cells at the nonpermissive temperature 37$^{\circ}$C, the <i>cdc13 cdc28</i> double mutant culture showed cells with one or more buds, most of which showed apical growth. The additional buds emerged without the intervening steps of nuclear division and cell separation. We suggest that the <i>cdc28</i> mutation abrogates a checkpoint function and allows cells with damaged or incompletely replicated DNA an entry to another round of cell cycle and bypasses the mitotic phase of the cell cycle.</p>

				<title>Meiosis and speciation: a study in a speciating <i>Mus terricolor</i> complex</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0105-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The three chromosomal species of the <i>Mus terricolor</i> complex possess $2n = 40$ chromosomes. We show that their karyotypes differ in stable heterochromatin variations fixed in homozygous condition as prominent short arms in auto-somes 1, 3 and 6. The three chromosomal species exhibit a high incidence of polymorphisms for Robertsonian fusions and pericentric inversions. Breeding experiments and histological analysis of testis show that heterozygosity for pericentric inversions and Robertsonian fusions had no effect on fertility. Meiotic analysis shows normal overall progression of meiosis in the heterozygotes, which is consistent with their normal gametogenesis. Nevertheless, both the inversion and fusion heterozygotes had undergone some alterations in the regular process of homologous synapsis, and it appeared that certain features of the meiotic system circumvented the potential negative effects of these polymorphic chromosomal rearrangements. The results indicate that the attributes of the meiotic system in a given organism could modulate the potential of a chromosomal rearrangement as reproductive barrier. The meiotic modulation hypothesis offers an explanation for the contradictory effects of the similar kinds of chromosomal mutations reported in different species.</p>

				<title>Characterization of newly established colorectal cancer cell lines: correlation between cytogenetic abnormalities and allelic deletions associated with multistep tumorigenesis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0113-0123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have established a series of 20 colorectal cancer cell lines and performed cytogenetic and RFLP analyses to show that the recurrent genetic abnormalities of chromosomes 1, 5, 17 and 18 associated with multistep tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer, and frequently detected as recurrent abnormalities in primary tumours, are also retained in long-term established cell lines. Earlier studies by us and other investigators showed that allelic losses of chromosomes 1 and 17 in primary colorectal cancers predicted poorer survival for the patients $(P = 0.03)$. We utilized the cell lines to identify specific chromosomal sites or gene(s) on chromosomes 1 and 17 which confer more aggressive phenotype. Cytogenetic deletions of chromosome 1p were detected in 14 out of the 20 (70\%) cell lines, whereas allelic deletions for 1p using polymorphic markers were detected in 13 out of 18 (72\%) informative cell lines for at least one polymorphic marker. We have performed Northern blotting, immunohistochemical staining (p53 mRNA, protein) and RFLP analysis using several probes including p53 and nm23. RFLP analysis using a total of seven polymorphic markers located on 17p and 17q arms showed allelic losses around the <i>p53</i> locus in 16 out of the 20 cell lines (80\%), four of which were losses of the <i>p53</i> locus itself. In addition, seven cell lines (out of nine informative cases) also showed losses of the <i>nm23</i> gene, four with concurrent losses of the <i>p53</i> locus, while the remaining three were homozygous. In addition, five out of seven cell lines with <i>nm23</i> deletions were derived from hepatic metastatic tumours, and one cell line was obtained from recurrent tumour. A comparison between allelic deletions of 1p and functional loss of <i>nm23</i> gene revealed a close association between these two events in cell lines derived from hepatic metastasis. Following immunohistochemical staining, nine out of the twenty cell lines showed high levels (25–80\%) of mutant p53, four showed intermediate levels $(\lt 20\%)$, and seven had undetectable levels of the protein. Of these seven, four showed complete absence of mRNA. Of the remaining three cell lines one showed aberrant mRNA due to germline rearrangement of the <i>p53</i> gene, whereas in two cell lines normal levels of mRNA were present. Nineteen of the 20 cell lines had normal germline configurations for the <i>p53</i> gene, while one showed a rearrangement. These data suggest that functional loss of <i>p53</i> and <i>nm23</i> genes accomplished by a variety of mechanisms may be associated with poor prognosis and survival. In addition, concurrent deletions of chromosome regions 17p, 17q and 1p were closely associated with high-stage hepatic metastatic disease. These cell lines with well-characterized genetic alterations and known clinical history provide an invaluable source of material for various biological and clinical studies relating to multistep colorectal tumorigenesis.</p>

				<title>Understanding protein–protein interactions by genetic suppression</title>
				<feature>Review article</feature>
				<page>0125-0129</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein–protein interactions influence many cellular processes and it is increasingly being felt that even a weak and remote interplay between two subunits of a protein or between two proteins in a complex may govern the fate of a particular biochemical pathway. In a bacterial system where the complete genome sequence is available, it is an arduous task to assign function to a large number of proteins. It is possible that many of them are peripherally associated with a cellular event and it is very difficult to probe such interaction. However, mutations in the genes that encode such proteins (primary mutations) are useful in these studies. Isolation of a suppressor or a second-site mutation that restores the phenotype abolished by the primary mutation could be an elegant yet simple way to follow a set of interacting proteins. Such a reversion site need not necessarily be geometrically close to the primary mutation site.</p>

				<title>Evolution of faster development does not lead to greater fluctuating asymmetry of sternopleural bristle number in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0007</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Both strong directional selection and faster development are thought to destabilize development, giving rise to greater fluctuating asymmetry (FA), although there is no strong empirical evidence supporting this assertion. We compared FA in sternopleural bristle number in four populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> successfully selected for faster development from egg to adult, and in four control populations. The fraction of perfectly symmetric individuals was higher in the selected populations, whereas the FA levels did not differ significantly between selected and control populations, clearly indicating that directional selection for faster development has not led to increased FA in sternopleural bristle number in these populations. This may be because:</p>
					<ol type="roman">
						<li>development time and FA are uncorrelated,</li> 
						<li>faster development does result in FA, but selection has favoured developmentally stable individuals that can develop fast and still be symmetrical, or</li>
						<li>the increased fraction of symmetric individuals in the selected populations is an artifact of reduced body size.</li> 
					</ol>
					<p>Although we cannot discriminate among these explanations, our results suggest that the relationship between development time, FA and fitness may be far more subtle than often thought.</p>

				<title>Accelerated molecular evolution of insect orthologues of <i>ERG28/C14orf1</i>: a link with ecdysteroid metabolism?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have analysed the evolution of <i>ERG28/C14orf1</i>, a gene coding for a protein involved in sterol biosynthesis. While primary sequence of the protein is well conserved in all organisms able to synthesize sterols <i>de novo</i>, strong divergence is noticed in insects, which are cholesterol auxotrophs. In spite of this virtual acceleration, our analysis suggests that the insect orthologues are evolving today at rates similar to those of the remaining members of the family. A plausible way to explain this acceleration and subsequent stabilization is that Erg28 plays a role in at least two different pathways. Discontinuation of the cholesterogenesis pathway in insects allowed the protein to evolve as much as the function in the other pathway was not compromised.</p>

				<title>Genetic variation at minisatellite loci D1S7, D4S139, D5S110 and D17S79 among three population groups of eastern India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0023-0030</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic variation at four minisatellite loci D1S7, D4S139, D5S110 and D17S79 in three predominant population groups of eastern India, namely Brahmin, Kayastha and Garo, are reported in this study. The Brahmin and Kayastha are of Indo-Caucasoid origin while the Garo community represents the Indo-Mongoloid ethnic group. The methodology employed comprised generation of <i>Hae</i>III-restricted fragments of isolated DNA, Southern blotting, and hybridization using chemiluminescent probes MS1, pH30, LH1 and V1 for the four loci. All four loci were highly polymorphic in the population groups. Heterozygosity values for the four loci ranged between 0.68 and 0.95. Neither departure from Hardy–Weinberg expectations nor evidence of any association across alleles among the selected loci was observed. The gene differentiation value among the loci is moderate $(G_{\text{ST}} = 0.027)$. A neighbour-joining tree constructed on the basis of the generated data shows very low genetic distance between the Brahmin and Kayastha communities in relation to the Garo. Our results based on genetic distance analysis are consistent with results of earlier studies based on serological markers and linguistic as well as morphological affiliations of these populations and their Indo-Caucasoid and Indo-Mongoloid origin. The minisatellite loci studied here were found to be not only useful in showing significant genetic variation between the populations but also to be suitable for human identity testing among eastern Indian populations.</p>

				<title>Isolation and characterization of stable mutants of <i>Streptomyces peucetius</i> defective in daunorubicin biosynthesis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0031-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Daunorubicin and its derivative doxorubicin are antitumour anthracycline antibiotics produced by <i>Streptomyces peucetius</i>. In this study we report isolation of stable mutants of <i>S. peucetius</i> blocked in different steps of the daunorubicin biosynthesis pathway. Mutants were screened on the basis of colony colour since producer strains are distinctively coloured on agar plates. Different mutants showed accumulation of aklaviketone, $\epsilon$-rhodomycinone, maggiemycin or 13-dihydrocarminomycin in their culture filtrates. These results indicate that the mutations in these isolates affect steps catalysed by <i>dnrE</i> (mutants SPAK and SPMAG), <i>dnrS</i> (SPFS and SPRHO) and <i>doxA</i> (SPDHC) gene products.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A convenient assay to score repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) in <i>Neurospora</i> employs the <i>erg-3</i> locus as a mutagenesis target. Using this assay we screened 132 wild-isolated <i>Neurospora crassa</i> strains for ability to dominantly suppress RIP. RIP was exceptionally inefficient in crosses with the wild isolates Sugartown (P0854) and Adiopodoume-7 (P4305), thereby suggesting the presence of dominant RIP suppressors in these strains. In other experiments, we found no evidence for dominant RIP suppression by the <i>Spore killer</i> haplotypes <i>Sk-2</i> and <i>Sk-3</i>.</p>

				<title>$K$-selection, $\alpha$-selection, effectiveness, and tolerance in competition: density-dependent selection revisited</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0063-0075</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the <i>Drosophila</i> literature, selection for faster development and selection for adapting to high density are often confounded, leading, for example, to the expectation that selection for faster development should also lead to higher competitive ability. At the same time, results from experimental studies on evolution at high density do not agree with many of the predictions from classical density-dependent selection theory. We put together a number of theoretical and empirical results from the literature, and some new experimental results on <i>Drosophila</i> populations successfully subjected to selection for faster development, to argue for a broader interpretation of density-dependent selection. We show that incorporating notions of $\alpha$-selection, and the division of competitive ability into effectiveness and tolerance components, into the concept of density-dependent selection yields a formulation that allows for a better understanding of the empirical results. We also use this broader formulation to predict that selection for faster development in <i>Drosophila</i> should, in fact, lead to the correlated evolution of decreased competitive ability, even though it does lead to the evolution of greater efficiency and higher population growth rates at high density when in monotypic culture.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mating activity and wing length were investigated in the F$_{1}$ progeny of <i>Drosophila willistoni</i> females collected in the field to examine any possible relationship between body size and mating success. The flies were observed in a mating chamber under laboratory conditions. No significant differences in wing length were observed between copulating and noncopulating flies, and there was no significant correlation between wing length and copulation latency for both males and females. These results therefore suggest that the commonly accepted view that large body size is positively correlated with mating success in <i>Drosophila</i> does not always hold true. The results support the view that the extent of environmentally induced variation in body size may be an important factor in determining whether an association between body size and mating success is observed in <i>Drosophila</i> species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report novel findings on the cytogenetic location, functional complexity and maternal and germline roles of the <i>stambh A</i> locus of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. <i>stmA</i> is localized to polytene bands 44D1.2 on 2R. <i>stmA</i> mutations are of two types: temperature-sensitive (ts) adult and larval paralytic or unconditional embryonic or larval lethal. Twelve alleles reported in this study fall into two intragenic complementing groups suggesting that <i>stmA</i> is a complex locus with more than one functional domain. Some unconditional embryonic lethal alleles show a ‘neurogenic’ phenotype of cuticle loss accompanied by neural hypertrophy. It is shown that embryos of ts paralytic alleles also show mild neural hypertrophy at permissive temperatures while short exposure to heat induces severe cuticle loss in these embryos. <i>stmA</i> exerts a maternal influence over heat-induced cuticle loss. Unconditional embryonic lethal alleles of <i>stmA</i> are also germline lethal.</p>

				<title>Male sterility associated with overexpression of the noncoding $hsr\omega$ gene in cyst cells of testis of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Of the several noncoding transcripts produced by the $hsr\omega$ gene of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the nucleus-limited $\gt 10$-kb hsr$\omega$-n transcript colocalizes with heterogeneous nuclear RNA binding proteins (hnRNPs) to form fine nucleoplasmic omega speckles. Our earlier studies suggested that the noncoding hsr$\omega$-n transcripts dynamically regulate the distribution of hnRNPs in active (chromatin bound) and inactive (in omega speckles) compartments. Here we show that a P transposon insertion in this gene’s promoter (at – 130 bp) in the $hsr\omega^{05241}$ enhancer-trap line had no effect on viability or phenotype of males or females, but the insertion-homozygous males were sterile. Testes of $hsr\omega^{05241}$ homozygous flies contained nonmotile sperms while their seminal vesicles were empty. RNA : RNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization showed that the somatic cyst cells in testes of the mutant male flies contained significantly higher amounts of hsr$\omega$-n transcripts, and unlike the characteristic fine omega speckles in other cell types they displayed large clusters of omega speckles as typically seen after heat shock. Two of the hnRNPs, viz. HRB87F and Hrp57A, which are expressed in cyst cells, also formed large clusters in these cells in parallel with the hsr$\omega$-n transcripts. A complete excision of the P transposon insertion restored male fertility as well as the fine-speckled pattern of omega speckles in the cyst cells. The <i>in situ</i> distribution patterns of these two hnRNPs and several other RNA-binding proteins (Hrp40, Hrb57A, S5, Sxl, SRp55 and Rb97D) were not affected by $hsr\omega$ mutation in any of the meiotic stages in adult testes. The present studies, however, revealed an unexpected presence (in wild-type as well as mutant) of the functional form of Sxl in primary spermatocytes and an unusual distribution of HRB87F along the retracting spindle during anaphase-telophase of the first meiotic division. It appears that the P transposon insertion in the promoter region causes a misregulated overexpression of $hsr\omega$ in cyst cells, which in turn results in excessive sequestration of hnRNPs and formation of large clusters of omega speckles in these cell nuclei. The consequent limiting availability of hnRNPs is likely to <i>trans</i>-dominantly affect processing of other pre-mRNAs in cyst cells. We suggest that a compromise in the activity of cyst cells due to the aberrant hnRNP distribution is responsible for the failure of individualization of sperms in $hsr\omega^{05241}$ mutant testes. These results further support a significant role of the noncoding hsr$\omega$-n transcripts in basic cellular activities, namely regulation of the availability of hnRNPs in active (chromatin bound) and inactive (in omega speckles) compartments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>More than 100 mutations have been reported till date in the rhodopsin gene in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. The present study was undertaken to detect the reported rhodopsin gene point mutations in Indian retinitis pigmentosa patients. We looked for presence or absence of codon 345 and 347 mutations in exon 5 of the gene using the technique of allele-specific polymerase chain reaction by designing primers for each mutation. We have examined 100 patients from 76 families irrespective of genetic categories. Surprisingly, in our sample the very widely reported highly frequent mutations of codon 347 (P $\to$ S/A/R/Q/L/T) were absent while the codon 345 mutation V $\to$ M was seen in three cases in one family (autosomal dominant form) and in one sporadic case (total two families). This is the first report on codon 345 and 347 mutation in Indian retinitis pigmentosa subjects.</p>

				<title>Axial distortion as a sensor of supercoil changes: a molecular model for the homeostatic regulation of DNA gyrase</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0119-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Negative supercoiling stimulates transcription of many genes. In contrast, transcription of the genes coding for DNA gyrase is subject to a novel mechanism of autoregulation, wherein relaxation of the template DNA stimulates their transcription. Since DNA gyrase is the sole supercoiling activity in the eubacterial cell, relaxation-stimulated transcription (RST) could reflect an autoregulatory mechanism to maintain supercoil levels within the cell. Extensive deletion and mutational analyses of <i>Escherichia coli gyrA</i> promoter have shown that the $-10$ region is essential for RST; however, a molecular model has proved to be elusive. We find a strong bend centre immediately downstream of the $-10$ region in the <i>gyrA</i> promoter. On the basis of analysis of various mutants in the $-10$ region, we propose a model where axial distortion acts as a sensor of topological changes in DNA. Our model is consistent with earlier data with <i>E. coli gyrA</i> and <i>gyrB</i> promoters. We also extrapolate the model to explain the phenomenon of RST of <i>gyr</i> promoters in other organisms and contrast it with promoters induced by supercoiling.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0125-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Linguistic evidence suggests that West Asia and Central Asia have been the two major geographical sources of genes in the contemporary Indian gene pool. To test the nature and extent of similarities in the gene pools of these regions we have collected DNA samples from four ethnic populations of northern India, and have screened these samples for a set of 18 Y-chromosome polymorphic markers (12 unique event polymorphisms and six short tandem repeats). These data from Indian populations have been analysed in conjunction with published data from several West Asian and Central Asian populations. Our analyses have revealed traces of population movement from Central Asia and West Asia into India. Two haplogroups, HG-3 and HG-9, which are known to have arisen in the Central Asian region, are found in reasonably high frequencies (41.7\%\ and 14.3\%\ respectively) in the study populations. The ages estimated for these two haplogroups are less in the Indian populations than those estimated from data on Middle Eastern populations. A neighbour-joining tree based on Y-haplogroup frequencies shows that the North Indians are genetically placed between the West Asian and Central Asian populations. This is consistent with gene flow from West Asia and Central Asia into India.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polymorphic allelic variants of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5, as well as of stromal-derived factor-1 SDF-1, the ligand for the chemokine receptor CXCR4, are known to have protective effects against HIV-1 infection and to be involved with delay in disease progression. We have studied the DNA polymorphisms at the loci that encode these proteins in 525 healthy individuals without any history of HIV-1 infection from 11 diverse populations of Andhra Pradesh, South India. The two protective alleles <i>SDF-1-3$'$A</i> and <i>CCR2-64I</i> at the SDF-1 and CCR2 loci, respectively, are present in all populations studied, although their frequencies differ considerably across populations (from 17\%\ to 35\%\ for the <i>SDF-1-3$'$A</i> allele, and from 3\%\ to 17\%\ for <i>CCR2-64I</i>). In contrast the <i>CCR5-$\Delta$32</i> allele is observed only in three populations (Yamani, Pathan and Kamma), all in low frequencies (i.e. 1\%\ to 3\%). The mean number of mutant alleles (for the three loci together) carried by each individual varies from 0.475 (in Vizag Brahmins) to 0.959 (in Bohra Muslims). The estimated relative hazard values for the populations, computed from the three-locus genotype data, are comparable to those from Africa and Southeast Asia, where AIDS is known to be widespread.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Oryza malampuzhaensis</i> Krish. <i>et</i> Chand. ($2n = 4x = 48$; Poaceae, <i>Oryza</i>) is endemic to Western Ghats, South India, and shows a highly localized distribution over a small geographical area in this region. This is the most poorly understood taxon in genus <i>Oryza</i> and is often misidentified as <i>O. officinalis</i> owing to their close morphology. We assessed the nature and distribution of genetic variation among 11 populations of <i>O. malampuzhaensis</i> using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The analysis revealed low genetic variation in <i>O. malampuzhaensis.</i> Cluster analysis of pairwise genetic distances of populations revealed three distinct clusters and the grouping of populations largely corresponded to their geographical proximity. Restricted gene flow and a geography-dependent differentiation were evident among populations. The altitude-influenced differences in ecological factors among the natural habitats of the populations seem to be the cause of the geography-dependent differentiation. Genetically isolated smaller populations and a narrow genetic base in <i>O. malampuzhaensis</i> point to its vulnerability to genetic drift and genetic depauperation. Thus <i>O. malampuzhaensis</i> appears to be under the threat of extinction and needs to be conserved by use of suitable methods. The present study also identified molecular markers diagnostic for <i>O. malampuzhaensis</i>.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of the genetic variability of 13 microsatellite markers in native Indian pigs</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0149-0153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analysed polymorphism of 13 microsatellites in two Indian domesticated pig types (North Indian and Northeast Indian). Heterozygosity, polymorphism information content, and probability of identity of two random individuals were calculated for all microsatellites in both types. The number of alleles observed at a locus varied between five and 12. The evaluated microsatellites exhibited a very high heterozygosity and polymorphism information content. The probability of identity of two random individuals from different populations taking into account all the 13 microsatellites was as low as $3.51 \times 10^{-19}$. On the basis of these results, we propose that these microsatellite markers may be used with reliability for studying the genetic diversity and for identification of individuals in Indian pig types.</p>

				<title>Cloning and characterization of an insecticidal crystal protein gene from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> subspecies <i>kenyae</i></title>

				<page>0005-0011</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A sporulating culture of <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> subsp. <i>kenyae</i> strain HD549 is toxic to larvae of lepidopteran insect species such as <i>Spodoptera litura, Helicoverpa armigera</i> and <i>Phthorimaea operculella</i>, and a dipteran insect, <i>Culex fatigans</i>. A 1.9-kb DNA fragment, PCR-amplified from HD549 using <i>cryII</i>-gene-specific primers, was cloned and expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The recombinant protein produced 92\%\ mortality in first-instar larvae of <i>Spodoptera litura</i> and 86\%\ inhibition of adult emergence in <i>Phthorimaea operculella</i>, but showed very low toxicity against <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>, and lower mortality against third-instar larvae of dipteran insects <i>Culex fatigans, Anopheles stephensi</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti</i>. The sequence of the cloned crystal protein gene showed almost complete homology with a mosquitocidal toxin gene from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> var. <i>kurstaki</i>, with only five mutations scattered in different regions. Amino acid alignment with different insecticidal crystal proteins using the MUTALIN program suggested presence of the conserved block 3 region in the sequence of this protein. A mutation in codon 409 of this gene that changes a highly conserved phenylalanine residue to serine lies in this block.</p>

				<title><i>RPE65</i> gene: multiplex PCR and mutation screening in patients from India with retinal degenerative diseases</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0019-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We used multiplex PCR followed by sequencing to screen for mutations in the 14 exons of the <i>RPE65</i> gene in early-childhood-onset autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) and Leber’s congenital amaurosis (LCA) patients. The RPE65 protein is believed to play an important role in the metabolism of vitamin A in the visual cycle and mutations identified in the gene could have implications for vitamin A-based therapeutic intervention. We were able to identify a homozygous mutation (AAT $\to$ AAG) in exon 9 in an arRP patient and a heterozygous missense transversion (AAT $\to$ AAG) also in exon 9 of an LCA patient. We also identified a polymorphism in exon 10 (GAG $\to$ GAA) in an arRP as well as an LCA patient. Mutation screening would be greatly facilitated by multiplex PCR which could cut down costs, labour and time involved. The nucleotide changes observed in this study could be <i>de novo</i>. Though a larger study has been undertaken, from the preliminary results it appears that in India the <i>RPE65</i> gene seems to be less involved in causation of LCA.</p>

				<title>Annotation and BAC/PAC localization of nonredundant ESTs from drought-stressed seedlings of an <i>indica</i> rice</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0025-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To decipher the genes associated with drought stress response and to identify novel genes in rice, we utilized 1540 high-quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for functional annotation and mapping to rice genomic sequences. These ESTs were generated earlier by $3'$-end single-pass sequencing of 2000 cDNA clones from normalized cDNA libraries constructed from drought-stressed seedlings of an <i>indica</i> rice. A rice UniGene set of 1025 transcripts was constructed from this collection through the BLASTN algorithm. Putative functions of 559 nonredundant ESTs were identified by BLAST similarity search against public databases. Putative functions were assigned at a stringency E value of $10^{-6}$ in BLASTN and BLASTX algorithms. To understand the gene structure and function further, we have utilized the publicly available finished and unfinished rice BAC/PAC (BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; PAC, P1 artificial chromosome) sequences for similarity search using the BLASTN algorithm. Further, 603 nonredundant ESTs have been mapped to BAC/PAC clones. BAC clones were assigned by a homology of above 95\%\ identity along 90\%\ of EST sequence length in the aligned region. In all, 700 ESTs showed rice EST hits in GenBank. Of the 325 novel ESTs, 128 were localized to BAC clones. In addition, 127 ESTs with identified putative functions but with no homology in IRGSP (International Rice Genome Sequencing Program) BAC/PAC sequences were mapped to the Chinese WGS (whole genome shotgun contigs) draft sequence of the rice genome. Functional annotation uncovered about a hundred candidate ESTs associated with abiotic stress in rice and <i>Arabidopsis</i> that were previously reported based on microarray analysis and other studies. This study is a major effort in identifying genes associated with drought stress response and will serve as a resource to rice geneticists and molecular biologists.</p>

				<title>Screening for homozygosity by descent in families with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0059-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetically heterogeneous disease and an important cause of blindness in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. In an attempt to identify the disease locus in families with the recessive form of the disease, we used the approach of screening for homozygosity by descent in offspring of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous families with RP. Microsatellite markers closely flanking 21 known candidate genes for RP were genotyped in parents and affected offspring to determine whether there was homozygosity at these loci that was shared by affected individuals of a family. This screening approach may be a rapid preliminary method to test known loci for possible cosegregation with disease.</p>

				<title>Candidate gene polymorphisms among North Indians and their association with schizophrenia in a case–control study</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0065-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Knowledge of candidate gene polymorphisms in a population is useful for a variety of gene–disease association studies, particularly for some complex traits. A number of candidate genes, a majority of them from the monoaminergic pathway in the brain, have been very popular in association studies with schizophrenia, a neuropsychiatric disorder. In this study diallelic/multiallelic polymorphisms in some dopaminergic, serotonergic and membrane-phospholipid-related genes have been evaluated in a control population recruited from North India. Association, if any, of these allelic variants with schizopherenia has been tested using a case–control approach. The case data have been taken from our published family-based association studies in schizophrenia. Of the eight genes tested in this study, association with schizophrenia was observed for only two gene polymorphisms, one in the promoter region of the serotonin 2A receptor gene and the other in the tryptophan hydroxylase gene. One new allele for the dopamine transporter gene (with eight repeats, 570-bp size), not reported in any population so far, has been identified in one individual in our sample. The data generated in this study, besides providing a normative background for various disease association studies, are a significant contribution to the population-specific genome database, a currently growing requirement.</p>

				<title>Mobile genetic elements in protozoan parasites</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0073-0086</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mobile genetic elements, by virtue of their ability to move to new chromosomal locations, are considered important in shaping the evolutionary course of the genome. They are widespread in the biological kingdom. Among the protozoan parasites several types of transposable elements are encountered. The largest variety is seen in the trypanosomatids—<i>Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi</i> and <i>Crithidia fasciculata</i>. They contain elements that insert site-specifically in the spliced-leader RNA genes, and others that are dispersed in a variety of genomic locations. <i>Giardia lamblia</i> contains three families of transposable elements. Two of these are subtelomeric in location while one is chromosome-internal. <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> has an abundant retrotransposon dispersed in the genome. Nucleotide sequence analysis of all the elements shows that they are all retrotransposons, and, with the exception of one class of elements in <i>T. cruzi</i>, all of them are non-long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons. Although most copies have accumulated mutations, they can potentially encode reverse transcriptase, endonuclease and nucleic-acid-binding activities. Functionally and phylogenetically they do not belong to a single lineage, showing that retrotransposons were acquired early in the evolution of protozoan parasites. Many of the potentially autonomous elements that encode their own transposition functions have nonautonomous counterparts that probably utilize the functions in trans. In this respect these elements are similar to the mammalian LINEs and SINEs (long and short interspersed DNA elements), showing a common theme in the evolution of retrotransposons. So far there is no report of a DNA transposon in any protozoan parasite. The genome projects that are under way for most of these organisms will help understand the evolution and possible function of these genetic elements.</p>

				<title>The power and statistical behaviour of allele-sharing statistics when applied to models with two disease loci</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0099-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have evaluated the power for detecting a common trait determined by two loci, using seven statistics, of which five are implemented in the computer program SimWalk2, and two are implemented in GENEHUNTER. Unlike most previous reports which involve evaluations of the power of allele-sharing statistics for a single disease locus, we have used a simulated data set of general pedigrees in which a two-locus disease is segregating and evaluated several non-parametric linkage statistics implemented in the two programs. We found that the power for detecting linkage using the $S_{\text{all}}$ statistic in GENEHUNTER (GH, version 2.1), implemented as statistic $E$ in SimWalk2 (version 2.82), is different in the two. The $P$ values associated with statistic $E$ output by SimWalk2 are consistently more conservative than those from GENEHUNTER except when the underlying model includes heterogeneity at a level of 50\%\ where the $P$ values output are very comparable. On the other hand, when the thresholds are determined empirically under the null hypothesis, $S_{\text{all}}$ in GENEHUNTER and statistic $E$ have similar power.</p>

				<title>Extreme nuclear disproportion and constancy of enzyme activity in a heterokaryon of <i>Neurospora crassa</i></title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0006</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heterokaryons of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> were generated by transformation of multinucleate conidia of a <i>histidine-3</i> auxotroph with <i>his-3$^{+}$</i> plasmid. In one of the transformants, propagated on a medium with histidine supplementation, a gradual but drastic reduction occurred in the proportion of prototrophic nuclei that contained an ectopically integrated <i>his-3$^{+}$</i> allele. This response was specific to histidine. The reduction in prototrophic nuclei was confirmed by several criteria: inoculum size test, hyphal tip analysis, genomic Southern analysis, and by visual change in colour of the transformant incorporating genetic colour markers. Construction and analyses of three-component heterokaryons revealed that the change in nuclear ratio resulted from interaction of auxotrophic nucleus with prototrophic nucleus that contained an ectopically integrated <i>his-3$^{+}$</i> gene, but not with prototrophic nucleus that contained <i>his-3$^{+}$</i> gene at the normal chromosomal location. The growth rate of heterokaryons and the activity of histidinol dehydrogenase—the protein encoded by the <i>his-3$^{+}$</i> gene—remained unchanged despite prototrophic nuclei becoming very scarce. The results suggest that not all nuclei in the coenocytic fungal mycelium may be active simultaneously, the rare active nuclei being sufficient to confer the wild-type phenotype.</p>

					<p>By employing a procedure that combines ELISA and photoacoustic spectroscopy, we have examined the content of 5-methylcytosine (m$^{5}$C) in DNA of individuals who differed from one another in the number of X chromosomes in their genomes. The results show that the human inactive X chromosome (Xi) contains very high amounts of this modified nucleotide. We estimate that in the 46,XX female there is more m$^{5}$C in Xi ($\sim 3.6 \times 10^{7}$) than in all the remaining chromosomes put together ($\sim 2.1 \times 10^{7}$). Our results also suggest that nearly one-fifth of all cytosines in Xi are methylated and that, in addition to CpG methylation, there is extensive non-CpG methylation as well.</p>

				<title>Absence of <i>GABRA1</i> Ala322Asp mutation in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy families from India</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An Ala322Asp mutation in the <i>GABRA1</i> gene was recently reported to be responsible for causing the autosomal dominant (AD) form of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) in a French-Canadian family. To study if JME families from India exhibiting the AD mode of inheritance carry the Ala322Asp mutation, we examined 35 unrelated JME-affected individuals from such families for the Ala322Asp mutation in <i>GABRA1</i>. Ala322Asp mutation was not observed in any of these JME-affected individuals, suggesting that this mutation is unlikely to be a predominant mutation involved in causation of epilepsy. To evaluate the possibility of other mutation(s) in and around <i>GABRA1</i> that may predispose to JME, we compared the allele frequencies at two marker loci, D5S2118 and D5S422, flanking <i>GABRA1</i>, in probands and 100 matched population controls. One of the allele frequencies at D5S422 shows a significant difference between the cases and controls ($\chi^{2} = 11.44$, d.f. = 1, $P = 0.0007$), suggesting genetic association between JME and genes located in the proximity of the DNA marker.</p>

				<title>Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel human kinase gene, <i>PDIK1L</i></title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We isolated a 4301-bp cDNA from a human foetal brain cDNA library by high-throughput cDNA sequencing. It encodes a protein of 341 amino acids, which shows 69\%\ identity with the human kinase CLIK1 (AAL99353), which was suggested to be the CLP-36 interacting kinase. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the putative kinase may interact with PDZ and LIM domain proteins. Therefore the protein and its cDNA were named ‘PDLIM1 interacting kinase 1 like’ (PDIK1L; nomenclature approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee). Ensembl Genome Browser located <i>PDIK1L</i> to human chromosome 1p35.3. It spans about 13.7 kb and consists of four exons and three introns. Multiple-tissue cDNA panel PCR revealed that the gene is expressed widely in human tissues: liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus and prostate. The protein appears to be localized to the nucleus.</p>

				<title>Ethnic variations of a retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (<i>RB1</i>) polymorphism in eight Asian populations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0033-0037</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An A $\to$ G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at nucleotide 153,104 in the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (<i>RB1</i>) at 13q14 was previously reported to be present only in Asians. In this study, we determined the distribution of this SNP in normal Southeast Asian populations (Chinese, Malay, Javanese, Thai, Filipino), in South Asian populations (Bangladeshi, Pakistani Pushtun and Indian) and in Chinese retinoblastoma cases and control subjects. The <i>RB1</i> SNP was present in all populations at an overall frequency of $\leq 0.18$. Heterozygosity was higher in the Southeast Asian groups (0.14–0.34) than in the South Asian groups (Bangladeshi and Indian) (0.04–0.06). Significant differences in allele frequencies were found between the two population groups. Interestingly, our Pakistani population comprised of ethnic Pushtuns from northwest Pakistan was significantly different from the neighbouring Bangladeshi and Indian populations. No significant difference was found between Chinese case patients and control subjects. This <i>RB1</i> SNP appears to be an ethnic variant prevalent in Southeast Asian populations and may be useful for studying <i>RB1</i> inheritance by pedigree analysis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Effective counselling and management of retinoblastoma families using genetic information is presently practised in many parts of the world. We studied histopathological, chromosomal and molecular-genetic data of two retinoblastoma patients from India. The two patients, one with bilateral and the other with unilateral retinoblastoma, underwent complete ophthalmic examination, cytogenetic study, retinoblastoma gene (<i>RB1</i>) mutational analysis and <i>RB1</i> promoter region methylation screening. In the bilateral retinoblastoma patient deletion of chromosome region 13q14 in peripheral blood lymphocytes and a hemizygous novel 8-bp deletion in exon 4 of <i>RB1</i> in tumour sample were observed. In the unilaterally affected patient CGA to TGA transition protein truncation mutations were observed in exons 8 and 14 of <i>RB1</i>.</p>

				<title>What have two decades of laboratory life-history evolution studies on <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> taught us?</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0045-0076</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of laboratory selection experiments on <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> over the past two decades has provided insights into the specifics of life-history tradeoffs in the species and greatly refined our understanding of how ecology and genetics interact in life-history evolution. Much of what has been learnt from these studies about the subtlety of the microevolutionary process also has significant implications for experimental design and inference in organismal biology beyond life-history evolution, as well as for studies of evolution in the wild. Here we review work on the ecology and evolution of life-histories in laboratory populations of <i>D. melanogaster</i>, emphasizing how environmental effects on life-history-related traits can influence evolutionary change. We discuss life-history tradeoffs—many unexpected—revealed by selection experiments, and also highlight recent work that underscores the importance to life-history evolution of cross-generation and cross-life-stage effects and interactions, sexual antagonism and sexual dimorphism, population dynamics, and the possible role of biological clocks in timing life-history events. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of typical selection experiments, and how these limitations might be transcended in the future by a combination of more elaborate and realistic selection experiments, developmental evolutionary biology, and the emerging discipline of phenomics.</p>

				<title>Genetic variability of sexual size dimorphism in a natural population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: an isofemale-line approach</title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0079-0088</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most animal species exhibit sexual size dimorphism (SSD). SSD is a trait difficult to quantify for genetical purposes since it must be simultaneously measured on two kinds of individuals, and it is generally expressed either as a difference or as a ratio between sexes. Here we ask two related questions: What is the best way to describe SSD, and is it possible to conveniently demonstrate its genetic variability in a natural population? We show that a simple experimental design, the isofemale-line technique (full-sib families), may provide an estimate of genetic variability, using the coefficient of intraclass correlation. We consider two SSD indices, the female–male difference and the female/male ratio. For two size-related traits, wing and thorax length, we found that both SSD indices were normally distributed. Within each family, the variability of SSD was estimated by considering individual values in one sex (the female) with respect to the mean value in the other sex (the male). In a homogeneous sample of 30 lines of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, both indices provided similar intraclass correlations, on average 0.21, significantly greater than zero but lower than those for the traits themselves: 0.50 and 0.36 for wing and thorax length respectively. Wing and thorax length were strongly positively correlated within each sex. SSD indices of wing and thorax length were also positively correlated, but to a lesser degree than for the traits themselves. For comparative evolutionary studies, the ratio between sexes seems a better index of SSD since it avoids scaling effects among populations or species, permits comparisons between different traits, and has an unambiguous biological significance. In the case of <i>D. melanogaster</i> grown at 25$^{\circ}$C, the average female/male ratios are very similar for the wing (1.16) and the thorax (1.15), and indicate that, on average, these size traits are 15–16\%\ longer in females.</p>

				<title>Mild heat stress at a young age in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> leads to increased Hsp70 synthesis after stress exposure later in life</title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0089-0094</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a number of animal species it has been shown that exposure to low levels of stress at a young age has a positive effect on stress resistance later in life, and on longevity. The positive effects have been attributed to the activation of defence/cleaning systems (heat shock proteins (Hsps), antioxidases, DNA repair) or to effects of a changed metabolic rate, or both. We investigated the effect of mild stress exposures early in life on Hsp70 synthesis after a harder stress exposure later in life in five isofemale lines of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Female flies were either exposed to repeated bouts of mild heat stress (3 h at 34$^{\circ}$°C) at a young age (days 2, 4 and 6 post-eclosion) or held under standard laboratory conditions. At 16 and 32 days of adult age, respectively, flies were exposed to a high temperature treatment known to induce Hsp70 in the investigated species (1 h at 37$^{\circ}$ºC). Thereafter, the inducible Hsp70 levels were measured. Our data show a tendency towards increased Hsp70 synthesis with increased age for both ‘mild stress’ and ‘no stress’ flies. Moreover, the results show that flies exposed to mild stress at a young age synthesized more Hsp70 upon induction, compared to control flies, and that this difference was accentuated at 32 days compared to 16 days of age. Thus, bouts of mild heat stress at a young age impact on the physiological stress response system later in life. This may be caused by an increased ability to react to future stresses. Alternatively, the mild stress exposure at a young age may actually have caused cellular damages increasing the need for Hsp70 levels after stress exposure later in life. The importance of an Hsp70 upregulation (throughout life) in explaining the phenomenon of hormesis is discussed, together with alternative hypotheses, and suggestions for further studies.</p>

				<title>Quantitative-genetic analysis of wing form and bilateral asymmetry in isochromosomal lines of <i>Drosophila subobscura</i> using Procrustes methods</title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0095-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often used as a measure of underlying developmental instability (DI), motivated by the idea that morphological variance is maladaptive. Whether or not DI has evolutionary potential is a highly disputed topic, marred by methodological problems and fuzzy prejudices. We report here some results from an ongoing study of the effects of karyotype, homozygosity and temperature on wing form and bilateral asymmetry using isochromosomal lines of <i>Drosophila subobscura</i>. Our approach uses the recently developed methodologies in geometric morphometrics to analyse shape configurations of landmarks within the standard statistical framework employed in studies of bilateral asymmetries, and we have extended these methods to partition the individual variation and the variation in asymmetries into genetic and environmental causal components. The analyses revealed temperature-dependent expression of genetic variation for wing size and wing shape, directional asymmetry (DA) of wing size, increased asymmetries at suboptimal temperature, and a transition from FA to DA in males as a result of increase in the rearing temperature. No genetic variation was generally detected for FA in our samples, but these are preliminary results because no crosses between lines were carried out and, therefore, the contribution of dominance was not taken into account. In addition, only a subset of the standing genetic variation was represented in the experiments.</p>

				<title>Molecular population genetics of the $\beta$-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0115-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated nucleotide polymorphism at the $\beta$-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster including the <i>Est-6</i> gene and $\psi$<i>Est-6</i> putative pseudogene in four samples of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> derived from natural populations of southern Africa (Zimbabwe), Europe (Spain), North America (USA: California), and South America (Venezuela). A complex haplo-type structure is revealed in both <i>Est-6</i> and $\psi$<i>Est-6</i>. Total nucleotide diversity is twice in $\psi$<i>Est-6</i> as in <i>Est-6</i>; diversity is higher in the African sample than in the non-African ones. Strong linkage disequilibrium occurs within the $\beta$-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster in non-African samples, but not in the African one. Intragenic gene conversion events are detected within <i>Est-6</i> and, to a much greater extent, within $\psi$<i>Est-6</i>; intergenic gene conversion events are rare. Tests of neutrality with recombination are significant for the $\beta$-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster in the non-African samples but not significant in the African one. We suggest that the demographic history (bottleneck and admixture of genetically differentiated populations) is the major factor shaping the pattern of nucleotide polymorphism in the $\beta$-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster. However there are some ‘footprints’ of directional and balancing selection shaping specific distribution of nucleotide polymorphism within the cluster. Intergenic epistatic selection between <i>Est-6</i> and $\psi$<i>Est-6</i> may play an important role in the evolution of the $\beta$-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster preserving the putative pseudogene from degenerative destruction and reflecting possible functional interaction between the functional gene and the putative pseudogene. <i>Est-6</i> and $\psi$<i>Est-6</i> may represent an indivisible intergenic complex (‘intergene’) in which each single component (<i>Est-6</i> or $\psi$<i>Est-6</i>) cannot separately carry out the full functional role.</p>

				<title>The devil in the details of life-history evolution: instability and reversal of genetic correlations during selection on <i>Drosophila</i> development</title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0133-0145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The evolutionary relationships between three major components of Darwinian fitness, development rate, growth rate and preadult survival, were estimated using a comparison of 55 distinct populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> variously selected for age-specific fertility, environmental-stress tolerance and accelerated development. Development rate displayed a strong net negative evolutionary correlation with weight at eclosion across all selection treatments, consistent with the existence of a size-versus-time tradeoff between these characters. However, within the data set, the magnitude of the evolutionary correlation depended upon the particular selection treatments contrasted. A previously proposed tradeoff between preadult viability and growth rate was apparent only under weak selection for juvenile fitness components. Direct selection for rapid development led to sharp reductions in both growth rates and viability. These data add to the mounting results from experimental evolution that illustrate the sensitivity of evolutionary correlations to</p>

					</ol>
					<p>Instability, disappearance and reversal of patterns of genetic covariation often occur over short evolutionary time frames and as the direct product of selection, rather than some stochastic process. We suggest that the functional architecture of fitness is a rapidly evolving matrix with reticulate properties, a matrix that we understand only poorly.</p>

				<title>The contribution of ancestry, chance, and past and ongoing selection to adaptive evolution</title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0147-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relative contributions of ancestry, chance, and past and ongoing selection to variation in one adaptive (larval feeding rate) and one seemingly nonadaptive (pupation height) trait were determined in populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> adapting to either low or high larval densities in the laboratory. Larval feeding rates increased rapidly in response to high density, and the effects of ancestry, past selection and chance were ameliorated by ongoing selection within 15–20 generations. Similarly, in populations previously kept at high larval density, and then switched to low larval density, the decline of larval feeding rate to ancestral levels was rapid (15–20 generations) and complete, providing support for a previously stated hypothesis regarding the costs of faster feeding in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. Variation among individuals was the major contributor to variation in pupation height, a trait that would superficially appear to be nonadaptive in the environmental context of the populations used in this study because it did not diverge between sets of populations kept at low versus high larval density for many generations. However, the degree of divergence among populations ($F_{\text{ST}}$) for pupation height was significantly less than expected for a selectively neutral trait, and we integrate results from previous studies to suggest that the variation for pupation height among populations is constrained by stabilizing selection, with a flat, plateau-like fitness function that, consequently, allows for substantial phenotypic variation within populations. Our results support the view that the genetic imprints of history (ancestry and past selection) in outbreeding sexual populations are typically likely to be transient in the face of ongoing selection and recombination. The results also illustrate the heuristic point that different forms of selection—for example directional versus stabilizing selection—acting on a trait in different populations may often not be due to differently shaped fitness functions, but rather due to differences in how the fitness function maps onto the actual distribution of phenotypes in a given population. We discuss these results in the light of previous work on reverse evolution, and the role of ancestry, chance, and past and ongoing selection in adaptive evolution.</p>

				<title>Hybridization, transgressive segregation and evolution of new genetic systems in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0163-0177</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Introgressive hybridization facilitates incorporation of genes from one species into the gene pool of another. Studies on long-term effects of introgressive hybridization in animal systems are sparse. <i>Drosophila nasuta</i> ($2n = 8$) and <i>D. albomicans</i> ($2n = 6$)—a pair of allopatric, morphologically almost identical, cross-fertile members of the <i>nasuta</i> subgroup of the <i>immigrans</i> species group—constitute an excellent system to analyse the impact of hybridization followed by transgressive segregation of parental characters in the hybrid progeny. Hybrid populations of <i>D. nasuta</i> and <i>D. albomicans</i> maintained for over 500 generations in the laboratory constitute new recombinant hybrid genomes, here termed cytoraces. The impact of hybridization, followed by introgression and transgressive segregation, on chromosomal constitution and karyotypes, some fitness parameters, isozymes, components of mating behaviour and mating preference reveals a complex pattern of interracial divergence among parental species and cytoraces. This assemblage of characters in different combinations in a laboratory hybrid zone allows us to study the emergence of new genetic systems. Here, we summarize results from our ongoing studies comparing these hybrid cytoraces with the parental species, and discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the evolution of new genetic systems.</p>

				<title>Thermal adaptation in <i>Drosophila serrata</i> under conditions linked to its southern border: unexpected patterns from laboratory selection suggest limited evolutionary potential</title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0179-0189</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To investigate the ability of <i>Drosophila serrata</i> to adapt to thermal conditions over winter at the species southern border, replicate lines from three source locations were held as discrete generations over three years at either 19$^{\circ}$C (40 generations) or temperatures fluctuating between 7$^{\circ}$C and 18$^{\circ}$C (20 generations). Populations in the fluctuating environment were maintained either with an adult 0$^{\circ}$C cold shock or without a shock. These conditions were expected to result in temperature-specific directional selection for increased viability and productivity under both temperature regimes, and reduced development time under the fluctuating-temperature regime. Selection responses of all lines were tested under both temperature regimes after controlling for carry-over effects by rearing lines in these environments for two generations. When tested in the 19$^{\circ}$C environment, lines evolving at 19$^{\circ}$C showed a faster development time and a lower productivity relative to the other lines, while cold shock reduced development time and productivity of all lines. When tested in the fluctuating environment, productivity of the 7–18$^{\circ}$C lines selected with a cold shock was relatively lower than that of lines selected without a shock, but this pattern was not observed in the other populations. Viability and body size as measured by wing length were not altered by selection or cold shock, although there were consistent effects of source population on wing length. These results provide little evidence for temperature-specific adaptation in <i>D. serrata</i>—although the lines had diverged for some traits, these changes were not consistent with a priori predictions. In particular, there was no evidence for life-history changes reflecting adaptation to winter conditions at the southern border. The potential for <i>D. serrata</i> to adapt to winter conditions may therefore be limited.</p>

				<title>Variation in adult life history and stress resistance across five species of <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0191-0205</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dry weight at eclosion, adult lifespan, lifetime fecundity, lipid and carbohydrate content at eclosion, and starvation and desiccation resistance at eclosion were assayed on a long-term laboratory population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and one recently wild-caught population each of four other species of <i>Drosophila</i>, two from the <i>melanogaster</i> and two from the <i>immigrans</i> species group. The relationships among trait means across the five species did not conform to expectations based on correlations among these traits inferred from selection studies on <i>D. melanogaster</i>. In particular, the expected positive relationships between fecundity and size/lipid content, lipid content and starvation resistance, carbohydrate (glycogen) content and desiccation resistance, and the expected negative relationship between lifespan and fecundity were not observed. Most traits were strongly positively correlated between sexes across species, except for fractional lipid content and starvation resistance per microgram lipid. For most traits, there was evidence for significant sexual dimorphism but the degree of dimorphism did not vary across species except in the case of adult lifespan, starvation resistance per microgram lipid, and desiccation resistance per microgram carbohydrate. Overall, <i>D. nasuta nasuta</i> and <i>D. sulfurigaster neonasuta</i> (<i>immigrans</i> group) were heavier at eclosion than the <i>melanogaster</i> group species, and tended to have somewhat higher absolute lipid content and starvation resistance. Yet, these two <i>immigrans</i> group species were shorter-lived and had lower average daily fecundity than the <i>melanogaster</i> group species. The smallest species, <i>D. malerkotliana</i> (<i>melanogaster</i> group), had relatively high daily fecundity, intermediate lifespan and high fractional lipid content, especially in females. <i>D. ananassae</i> (<i>melanogaster</i> group) had the highest absolute and fractional carbohydrate content, but its desiccation resistance per microgram carbohydrate was the lowest among the five species. In terms of overall performance, the laboratory population of <i>D. melanogaster</i> was clearly superior, under laboratory conditions, to the other four species if adult lifespan, lifetime fecundity, average daily fecundity, and absolute starvation and desiccation resistance are considered. This finding is contrary to several recent reports of substantially higher adult lifespan and stress resistance in recently wild-caught flies, relative to flies maintained for a long time in discrete-generation laboratory cultures. Possible explanations for these apparent anomalies are discussed in the context of the differing selection pressures likely to be experienced by <i>Drosophila</i> populations in laboratory versus wild environments.</p>

				<title>Latitudinal clines in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: body size, allozyme frequencies, inversion frequencies, and the insulin-signalling pathway</title>
				<feature>Special issue - Evolutionary genetics: the Drosophila model</feature>
				<page>0207-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many latitudinal clines exist in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: in adult body size, in allele frequency at allozyme loci, and in frequencies of common cosmopolitan inversions. The question is raised whether these latitudinal clines are causally related. This review aims to connect data from two very different fields of study, evolutionary biology and cell biology, in explaining such natural genetic variation in <i>D. melanogaster</i> body size and development time. It is argued that adult body size clines, inversion frequency clines, and clines in allele frequency at loci involved in glycolysis and glycogen storage are part of the same adaptive strategy. Selection pressure is expected to differ at opposite ends of the clines. At high latitudes, selection on <i>D. melanogaster</i> would favour high larval growth rate at low temperatures, and resource storage in adults to survive winter. At low latitudes selection would favour lower larval critical size to survive crowding, and increased male activity leading to high male reproductive success. Studies of the insulin-signalling pathway in <i>D. melanogaster</i> point to the involvement of this pathway in metabolism and adult body size. The genes involved in the insulin-signalling pathway are associated with common cosmopolitan inversions that show latitudinal clines. Each chromosome region connected with a large common cosmopolitan inversion possesses a gene of the insulin transmembrane complex, a gene of the intermediate pathway and a gene of the TOR branch. The hypothesis is presented that temperate <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations have a higher frequency of a ‘thrifty’ genotype corresponding to high insulin level or high signal level, while tropical populations possess a more ‘spendthrift’ genotype corresponding to low insulin or low signal level.</p>

				<title>Refinement of the locus for non-syndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2)</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0035-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Non-syndromic X-linked deafness is a rare form of genetic deafness in humans accounting for a small proportion of all hereditary hearing loss. Different clinical forms of non-syndromic X-linked deafness have been described, and most of these have been mapped. Here, we report a Chinese family affected by a congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss. All phenotypes of this family are clinically compatible with non-syndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2). A maximum two-point Lod score of 2.32 was obtained at marker <i>DXS6797</i> ($\theta = 0.00$). Recombinants define a region of 4.3 cm flanked by markers <i>DXS6799</i> and <i>GATA172D05</i>. This region overlaps the previously reported DFN2 region by 2.0 cm.</p>

				<title>Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation in the Anatolian Peninsula (Turkey)</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0039-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Throughout human history, the region known today as the Anatolian peninsula (Turkey) has served as a junction connecting the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia, and, thus, has been subject to major population movements. The present study is undertaken to obtain information about the distribution of the existing mitochondrial D-loop sequence variations in the Turkish population of Anatolia. A few studies have previously reported mtDNA sequences in Turks. We attempted to extend these results by analysing a cohort that is not only larger, but also more representative of the Turkish population living in Anatolia. In order to obtain a descriptive picture for the phylogenetic distribution of the mitochondrial genome within Turkey, we analysed mitochondrial D-loop region sequence variations in 75 individuals from different parts of Anatolia by direct sequencing. Analysis of the two hypervariable segments within the noncoding region of the mitochondrial genome revealed the existence of 81 nucleotide mutations at 79 sites. The neighbour-joining tree of Kimura’s distance matrix has revealed the presence of six main clusters, of which H and U are the most common. The data obtained are also compared with several European and Turkic Central Asian populations.</p>

				<title>Deciphering diversity in populations of various linguistic and ethnic affiliations of different geographical regions of India: analysis based on 15 microsatellite markers</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0049-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The extent of genetic polymorphism at fifteen autosomal microsatellite markers in 54 ethnically, linguistically and geographically diverse human populations of India was studied to decipher intrapopulation diversity. The parameters used to quantify intrapopulation diversity were average allele diversity, average heterozygosity, allele range (base pairs), and number of alleles. Multilocus genotype frequencies calculated for selected populations were utilized for testing conformity with the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The exact test values, after Bonferroni correction, showed significant deviation amongst Gowda (vWA, Penta E); Dhangar, Satnami and Gounder (D8S1179); Hmar (FGA); Kuki and Balti (vWA) groups. Relatively low number of alleles and allelic diversity (base-pairs size) had been observed in populations of central India as compared with southern and northern regions of the country. The communities of Indo-Caucasoid ethnic origin and Indo-European linguistic family (Kshatriya of Uttar Pradesh) showed highest allelic diversity, as well as rare alleles, not reported in any other Indian populations. Analysis based on average heterozygosity was also found to be lowest among the populations of central India (0.729) and highest among the populations from north (0.777) and west (0.784) regions of the country, having Indo-Caucasoid ethnic origin and Austro-Asiatic linguistic affiliation. The maximum power of discrimination (85\%–89\%) had been observed at loci FGA, Penta E, D18S51 and D21S11, suggested high intrapopulation diversity in India. Genetic diversity revealed by STR markers was consistent with the known demographic histories of populations. Thus, the present study clearly demonstrated that the intrapopulation diversity is not only present at the national level, but also within smaller geographical regions of the country. This is the first attempt to understand the extent of diversity within populations of India at such a large scale at genomic level.</p>

				<title>Allelic structure and distribution of 103 STR loci in a Southern Tunisian population</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0065-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genotypes of 103 short tandem repeat (STR) markers distributed at an average of 40 cM intervals throughout the genome were determined for 40 individuals from the village of BirEl Hfai (BEH). This village of approximately 31.000 individuals is localized in the south-west of Tunisia. The allele frequency distributions in BEH were compared with those obtained for individuals in the CEPH (Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain) data using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov two-sample test. Fourteen out of the 103 markers (13.2%) showed significant differences ($P\lt 0.05$) in distribution between the two populations. Population heterogeneity in BEH was indicated by an excess of observed homozygosity deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium at 3 loci ($P\lt 0.0005$). No evidence for genotypic disequilibrium was found for any of the marker pairs. This demonstrated that in spite of a high inbreeding level in the population, few markers showed evidence for a different pattern of allelic distribution compared to CEPH.</p>

				<title>Circadian clocks and life-history related traits: is pupation height affected by circadian organization in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0073-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>D. melanogaster</i>, the observation of greater pupation height under constant darkness than under constant light has been explained by the hypothesis that light has an inhibitory effect on larval wandering behaviour, preventing larvae from crawling higher up the walls of culture vials prior to pupation. If this is the only role of light in affecting pupation height, then various light : dark regimes would be predicted to yield pupation heights intermediate between those seen in constant light and constant darkness. We tested this hypothesis by measuring pupation height under various light : dark regimes in four laboratory populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Pupation height was the greatest in constant darkness, intermediate in constant light, and the least in a light / dark regime of LD 14:14 h. The results clearly suggest that there is more to light regime effects on pupation height than mere behavioural inhibition of wandering larvae, and that circadian organization may play some role in determining pupation height, although the details of this role are not yet clear. We briefly discuss these results in the context of the possible involvement of circadian clocks in life-history evolution.</p>

				<title>Structural and functional analysis of rice genome</title>
				<feature>Review article</feature>
				<page>0079-0099</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rice is an excellent system for plant genomics as it represents a modest size genome of 430 Mb. It feeds more than half the population of the world. Draft sequences of the rice genome, derived by whole-genome shotgun approach at relatively low coverage (4–6 X), were published and the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) declared high quality ($\gt 10$ X), genetically anchored, phase 2 level sequence in 2002. In addition, phase 3 level finished sequence of chromosomes 1, 4 and 10 (out of 12 chromosomes of rice) has already been reported by scientists from IRGSP consortium. Various estimates of genes in rice place the number at $\gt 50,000$. Already, over 28,000 full-length cDNAs have been sequenced, most of which map to genetically anchored genome sequence. Such information is very useful in revealing novel features of macro- and micro-level synteny of rice genome with other cereals. Microarray analysis is unraveling the identity of rice genes expressing in temporal and spatial manner and should help target candidate genes useful for improving traits of agronomic importance. Simultaneously, functional analysis of rice genome has been initiated by marker-based characterization of useful genes and employing functional knock-outs created by mutation or gene tagging. Integration of this enormous information is expected to catalyze tremendous activity on basic and applied aspects of rice genomics.</p>

				<title>REML estimates of genetic parameters of sexual dimorphism for wing and thorax length in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0163-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Restricted maximum likelihood was used to estimate genetic parameters of male and female wing and thorax length in isofemale lines of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and results compared to estimates obtained earlier with the classical analysis of variance approach. As parents within an isofemale line were unknown, a total of 500 parental pedigrees were simulated and mean estimates computed. Full and half sibs were distinguished, in contrast to usual isofemale studies in which animals were all treated as half sibs and hence heritability was overestimated. Heritability was thus estimated at 0.33, 0.38, 0.30 and 0.33 for male and female wing length and male and female thorax length, respectively, whereas corresponding estimates obtained using analysis of variance were 0.46, 0.54, 0.35 and 0.38. Genetic correlations between male and female traits were 0.85 and 0.62 for wing and thorax length, respectively. Sexual dimorphism and the ratio of female to male traits were moderately heritable (0.30 and 0.23 for wing length, 0.38 and 0.23 for thorax length). Both were moderately and positively correlated with female traits, and weakly and negatively correlated with male traits. Such heritabilities confirmed that sexual dimorphism might be a fast evolving trait in <i>Drosophila.</i></p>

				<title>Genetic and genotype $\times$ environment interaction effects for the content of seven essential amino acids in <i>indica</i> rice</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0171-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is necessary for rice breeders to understand the genetic basis of nutrient quality traits of rice. Essential amino acids are most important in determining the nutrient quality of rice grain and can affect the health of people who depend on rice as a staple food. In view of the paucity of genetic information available on essential amino acids in <i>indica</i> rice, we estimated the genetic main effects and genotype $\times$ environment (G $\times$ E) interaction effects on the content of essential amino acids. Nine cytoplasmic male sterile lines as females and five restorer lines as males were introduced in a North Carolina II design across environments. Estimates of the content of the essential amino acids valine, methionine, leucine and phenylalanine showed that they were mainly controlled by genetic main effects, while the contents of threonine, cysteine and isoleucine were mainly affected by G $\times$ E effects. In the case of genetic main effects, both cytoplasmic and maternal genetic effects were predominant for all essential amino acids, indicating that selection for improving essential amino acid content based on maternal performance would be more effective than that based on seeds. The total narrow-sense heritabilities were high and ranged from 0.72 to 0.83. Since general heritabilities for these essential amino acids (except for cysteine) were found to be much larger than G $\times$ E interaction heritability, the improvement of content of most essential amino acids under selection would be expected under various environments. Rice varieties such as Zhenan 3, Yinchao 1, T49, 26715, 102 and 1391 should be selected as optimal parents for increasing the content of most essential amino acids, while the total genetic effects from Zhexie 2, Xieqingzao, Gangchao 1, V20, Zuo 5 and Zhenshan 97 were mainly negative and these parents could decrease the contents of most essential amino acids.</p>

				<title>Variation in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects in novel versus familiar environments in two <p>Drosophila</p> species</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0179-0188</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Models of competitor coevolution, especially the genetic feedback hypothesis, suggest that a negative correlation between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects may be important in sustaining competitor coexistence, and can give rise to oscillatory dynamics with repeated reversals of competitive superiority. I reanalyzed previously published census data from an experiment in which populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>D. simulans</i> underwent competitive coevolution in one familiar and two novel environments, to specifically look for any evidence of a negative relationship between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates, and for any indication of short period cycling in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects. While there was considerable variation in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects over generations, among both populations and environments, there was no clear evidence supporting the genetic feedback hypothesis. Intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates were strongly positively correlated in novel environments, and uncorrelated in the familiar environment. Data from the familiar environment indicated that indices of competition of populations of the initially superior competitor, <i>D. melanogaster</i>, might be showing some cyclic behaviour, but I argue that this is likely to be transient, and not suggestive of sustained oscillatory dynamics predicted by the genetic feedback model. I discuss the results in the context of the importance of the genetic architecture of intraspecific and interspecific competitive abilities in determining the coevolutionary trajectory of competitive interactions.</p>

				<title>Cytochrome P450c17$\alpha$ 5$'$-untranslated region *T/C polymorphism in endometriosis</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0189-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estrogen plays a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The CYP17 gene codes for the cytochrome P450c17$\alpha$ enzyme that is involved in the estrogen biosynthesis. We aimed to investigate if CYP17 polymorphism could be used as marker to predict the susceptibility of endometriosis. Women were divided into two groups:</p>
					<ol type="arabic">
						<li>severe endometriosis (n=119);</li>
						<li>non-endometriosis groups (n=128).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>A 169-bp fragment encompassing the T/C polymorphic site in 5$'$-untranslated promoter region ($5'$-UTR) of the CYP17 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, treated with restriction enzyme MspA1I, and electrophoresis. The polymorphism was divided into restriction- enzyme indigestible (T homozygote), T/C heterozygote, and digestible (C homozygote). Genotypes and allelic frequencies for this polymorphism in both groups were compared. We observed a higher but non-significant percentage of T homozygote in the endometriosis women compared with the non-endometriosis women. Proportions of T homozygote/heterozygote/C homozygote for CYP17 in both groups were:</p>
					<ol type="arabic">
						<li>26.1/46.2/27.7\%\ and</li> 
						<li>17.2/45.3/37.5\%\ (p- value=0.131).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>T allele was related with higher susceptibility of endometriosis. T and C allele frequencies in both groups were:</p>
					<ol type="arabic">
						<li>49.2/50.8\%;</li>
						<li>39.8/60.2\% (p- value=0.046).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Despite the CYP17* T allele appearing to be asscoiatd with a trend of increased risk of endometriosis, CYP17 $5'$-UTR gene polymorphism might not be a useful marker for prediction of endometriosis susceptibility.</p>

					<p>We describe tests for detecting and locating quantitative trait loci (QTL) for traits in Hanwoo cattle. From results of a permutation test to detect QTL for marbling, we selected the microsatellite locus ILSTS035 on chromosome 6 for further analysis. $K$-means clustering analysis applied to five traits and nine DNA markers in ILSTS035 resulted in three cluster groups. Finally we employed the bootstrap test method to calculate confidence intervals using the resampling method to find major DNA markers. We conclude that the major markers of ILSTS035 locus on chromosome 6 of Hanwoo cattle are markers 235 bp and 266 bp.</p>

				<title>Excess of counterclockwise scalp hair-whorl rotation in homosexual men</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0251-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>While most men prefer women as their sexual partners, some are bisexual and others are homosexuals. It has been debated for a long time whether a person’s sexual preference is innate, learned, or due to a combination of both causes. It was recently discovered that the human right-versus-left-hand use preference and the direction of scalp hair-whorl rotation develop from a common genetic mechanism. Such a mechanism controls functional specialization of brain hemispheres. Whether the same mechanism specifying mental makeup influences sexual preference was determined here by comparing hair-whorl rotation in groups enriched with homosexual men with that in males at large. Only a minority of 8.2\%\ ($n = 207$) unselected ‘control’ group of males had counterclockwise rotation. In contrast, all three samples enriched with homosexual men exhibited highly significant ($P \lt 0.0001$), 3.6-fold excess (29.8\%, $n = 272$) counterclockwise rotation. These results suggest that sexual preference may be influenced in a significant proportion of homosexual men by a biological/genetic factor that also controls direction of hair-whorl rotation.</p>

				<title>Cloning of a novel gene, <i>Cymg1</i>, related to family 2 cystatins and expressed at specific stages of mouse testis development</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0257-0263</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have cloned a novel gene, <i>Cymg1</i> (GenBank accession number AY600990), from a mouse testis cDNA library. <i>Cymg1</i> is located in 2G3 of mouse chromosome 2. The cDNA includes an open reading frame that encodes 141 amino acid residues. The encoded polypeptide has a cysteine protease inhibitor domain found in the family 2 cystatins but lacks critical consensus sites important for cysteine protease inhibition. These characteristics are seen in the proteins of the CRES subfamily of the family 2 cystatins which are expressed specifically in the reproductive tract. CYMG1 protein shows 44\%\ identity with mouse CRES and 30\%\ identity with mouse cystatin C. Northern blot analysis showed that the <i>Cymg1</i> gene was specifically expressed in adult mouse testis. RT-PCR also showed that <i>Cymg1</i> was expressed in testis and spermatogonial cells. <i>Cymg1</i> expression level varied in the different developmental stages of mouse testis, and were coincidental with spermatogenesis and sex maturation. These results indicate that <i>Cymg1</i> may play important roles in mouse spermatogenesis and sex maturation</p>

				<title>Quantitative genetics of functional characters in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> populations subjected to laboratory selection</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0265-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>What are the genetics of phenotypes other than fitness, in outbred populations? To answer this question, the quantitative-genetic basis of divergence was characterized for outbred <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> populations that had previously undergone selection to enhance characters related to fitness. Line-cross analysis using first-generation and second-generation hybrids from reciprocal crosses was conducted for two types of cross, each replicated fivefold. One type of cross was between representatives of the ancestral population, a set of five populations maintained for several hundred generations on a two-week discrete-generation life cycle and a set of five populations adapted to starvation stress. The other type of cross was between the same set of ancestral-representative populations and another set of five populations selected for accelerated development from egg to egg. Developmental time from egg to eclosion, starvation resistance, dry body weight and fecundity at day 14 from egg were fit to regression models estimating single-locus additive and dominant effects, maternal and paternal effects, and digenic additive and dominance epistatic effects. Additive genetic variation explained most of the differences between populations, with additive maternal and cytoplasmic effects also commonly found. Both within-locus and between-locus dominance effects were inferred in some cases, as well as one instance of additive epistasis. Some of these effects may have been caused by linkage disequilibrium. We conclude with a brief discussion concerning the relationship of the genetics of population differentiation to adaptation.</p>

				<title>Exact Tandem Repeats Analyzer (E-TRA): A new program for DNA sequence mining</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0049-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Exact Tandem Repeats Analyzer 1.0 (E-TRA) combines sequence motif searches with keywords such as ‘organs’, ‘tissues’, ‘cell lines’ and ‘development stages’ for finding simple exact tandem repeats as well as non-simple repeats. E-TRA has several advanced repeat search parameters/options compared to other repeat finder programs as it not only accepts GenBank, FASTA and expressed sequence tags (EST) sequence files, but also does analysis of multiple files with multiple sequences. The minimum and maximum tandem repeat motif lengths that E-TRA finds vary from one to one thousand. Advanced user defined parameters/options let the researchers use different minimum motif repeats search criteria for varying motif lengths simultaneously. One of the most interesting features of genomes is the presence of relatively short tandem repeats (TRs). These repeated DNA sequences are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, distributed almost at random throughout the genome. Some of the tandem repeats play important roles in the regulation of gene expression whereas others do not have any known biological function as yet. Nevertheless, they have proven to be very beneficial in DNA profiling and genetic linkage analysis studies. To demonstrate the use of E-TRA, we used 5,465,605 human EST sequences derived from 18,814,550 GenBank EST sequences. Our results indicated that 12.44\%\ (679,800) of the human EST sequences contained simple and non-simple repeat string patterns varying from one to 126 nucleotides in length. The results also revealed that human organs, tissues, cell lines and different developmental stages differed in number of repeats as well as repeat composition, indicating that the distribution of expressed tandem repeats among tissues or organs are not random, thus differing from the un-transcribed repeats found in genomes.</p>

				<title>Comparative studies on codon usage pattern of chloroplasts and their host nuclear genes in four plant species</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0055-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed comparison was made of codon usage of chloroplast genes with their host (nuclear) genes in the four angiosperm species <i>Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Triticum aestivum</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The average GC content of the entire genes, and at the three codon positions individually, was higher in nuclear than in chloroplast genes, suggesting different genomic organization and mutation pressures in nuclear and chloroplast genes. The results of Nc-plots and neutrality plots suggested that nucleotide compositional constraint had a large contribution to codon usage bias of nuclear genes in <i>O. sativa, Z. mays,</i> and <i>T. aestivum</i>, whereas natural selection was likely to be playing a large role in codon usage bias in chloroplast genomes. Correspondence analysis and chi-test showed that regardless of the genomic environment (species) of the host, the codon usage pattern of chloroplast genes differed from nuclear genes of their host species by their AU-richness. All the chloroplast genomes have predominantly A- and/or U-ending codons, whereas nuclear genomes have G-, C- or U-ending codons as their optimal codons. These findings suggest that the chloroplast genome might display particular characteristics of codon usage that are different from its host nuclear genome. However, one feature common to both chloroplast and nuclear genomes in this study was that pyrimidines were found more frequently than purines at the synonymous codon position of optimal codons.</p>

				<title>Mutational analysis of the <i>BRCA1</i> gene in 30 Czech ovarian cancer patients</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0063-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ovarian cancer is one of the most severe of oncological diseases. Inherited mutations in cancer susceptibility genes play a causal role in 5–10\%\ of newly diagnosed tumours. <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> gene alterations are found in the majority of these cases. The aim of this study was to analyse the <i>BRCA1</i> gene in the ovarian cancer risk group to characterize the spectrum of its mutations in the Czech Republic. Five overlapping fragments amplified on both genomic DNA and cDNA were used to screen for the whole protein-coding sequence of the <i>BRCA1</i> gene. These fragments were analysed by the protein truncation test (PTT) and direct sequencing. Three inactivating mutations were identified in the group of 30 Czech ovarian cancer patients: the 5382insC mutation in two unrelated patients and a deletion of exons 21 and 22 in another patient. In addition, we have found an alternatively spliced product lacking exon 5 in two other unrelated patients. The 5382insC is the most frequent alteration of the <i>BRCA1</i> gene in Central and Eastern Europe. The deletion of exons 21 and 22 affects the BRCT functional domain of the BRCA1 protein. Although large genomic rearragements are known to be relatively frequent in Western European populations, no analyses have been performed in our region yet.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic divergence was evaluated in 31 breeding lines from four <i>Brassica</i> species using Mahalanobis’ $D^{2}$. A new method of grouping using $D^{2}$ values was used to group the 31 lines, based on diagnostic morphological traits (called morphoqts). Isozyme variation of the individual enzymes esterase and glutamate oxaloacetate was quantified by five parameters (called isoqts) developed earlier. Grouping by the same method was also done based on the isoqts, and the grouping by isozymes was compared with that by morphoqts. Overall, there was an agreement of 73\%\ suggesting that isoqts can be used in the choice of parents and also first stage selection of segregants in the laboratory. It was suggested that such an exercise would help to take care of season-bound and field-related problems of breeding. The new isozyme QTs, within lane variance of relative mobility and relative absorption, accounted for about 50\%\ of the total divergence. The utility of the new method and isoqts in cost-effective breeding were highlighted.</p>

				<title>Effect of splice-site polymorphisms of the <i>TMPRSS4, NPHP4</i> and <i>ORCTL4</i> genes on their mRNA expression</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0131-0136</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic polymorphisms associated with structural changes of their gene product are important in terms of their potential relation with diseases. Therefore, in this study, splice-site variants of the transmembrane serine protease gene <i>TMPRSS4</i>, nephronophthisis gene <i>NPHP4</i>, and organic-cation transporter gene <i>ORCTL4</i>, were selected from the dbSNP single nucleotide polymorphism database as candidates to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with a structural change in their mRNA transcripts. The allele frequencies of the <i>TMPRSS4</i> c.4-7A$\gt$G, <i>NPHP4</i> c.2818-2A$\gt$T, and <i>ORCTL4</i> c.517-2A$\gt$C polymorphisms in a Japanese population were determined to be 0.42, 0.10, and 0.27, respectively, by PCR-SSCP analysis. Next, the effect of these polymorphisms on the mode of pre-mRNA splicing was investigated by RT-PCR analysis followed by sequencing analysis. The <i>TMPRSS4</i>, <i>NPHP4</i>, and <i>ORCTL4</i> polymorphisms were associated with the production of the r.4-6_4-1ins transcript, the r.2818_2823del and r.2818_2859del transcripts, and the r.517-94_517-1ins; r.517-2a$\gt$c and r.517_620del transcripts, respectively. Since the proteins encoded by all these transcripts are associated with relatively significant structural changes in the form amino acid insertion/deletion and premature termination, their functional ability may be greatly reduced. Our demonstration of structural changes in mRNA transcripts as a result of splice-site polymorphisms implies that they may be of biological significance in certain pathological conditions.</p>

				<title>Molecular phylogeny of the domesticated silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, based on the sequences of mitochondrial <i>cytochrome b</i> genes</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0137-0142</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Pupae from the Chinese wild mulberry silkworm, <i>Bombyx mandarina</i>, and 11 representative strains of the domesticated silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i> were selected for preparation of mitochondrial DNA. The $5'$-end fragments of <i>cytochrome b</i> genes (<i>Cytb</i>) were generated by polymerase chain reaction products and sequenced directly. The homologous sequences of the Japanese <i>B. mandarina</i> and three strains of <i>B. mori</i> were from the GenBank database. The sequences of the 16 silkworm strains were analysed with DNASTAR software and a phylogenic tree was constructed using PHYLIP software. The result showed that:</p>
					<ol type ="roman">
						<li>The sequence divergence between the strains of <i>B. mori</i> and the Japanese <i>B. mandarina</i> was larger (5.4\%\ $\sim$ 5.8\%) compared with that between strains of <i>B. mori</i> and the Chinese <i>B. mandarina</i> (0.8\%\ $\sim$ 1.9\%). Analysis of clustering also showed that the sequences of <i>B. mori</i> strains and Chinese <i>B. mandarina</i> clustered into group (B group), while that of Japanese <i>B. mandarina</i> (<i>A group</i>) was outside this cluster. This may be evidence for the hypothesis that <i>B. mori</i> originated from Chinese <i>B. mandarina.</i></li> 
						<li>Among 14 strains of <i>B. mori</i>, sequence divergence was small and the most divergence was seen between strains Yanhe-1 and Chuxiong, whose sequences branched off from those of the other <i>B. mori</i> strains on the phylogenetic tree. From this and from historical records, we infer that the strains Yanhe-1 and Chuxiong originated independently from southwest China.</li>

				<title>Dissecting the correlation structure of a bivariate phenotype: common genes or shared environment?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0143-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High correlations between two quantitative traits may be either due to common genetic factors or common environmental factors or a combination of both. In this study, we develop statistical methods to extract the genetic contribution to the total correlation between the components of a bivariate phenotype. Using data on bivariate phenotypes and marker genotypes for sib-pairs, we propose a test for linkage between a common QTL and a marker locus based on the conditional cross-sib trait correlations (trait 1 of sib 1 – trait 2 of sib 2 and conversely) given the identity-by-descent (i.b.d.) sharing at the marker locus. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed test under different trait parameters and quantitative trait distributions. An application of the method is illustrated using data on two alcohol-related phenotypes from a project on the collaborative study on the genetics of alcoholism.</p>

				<title>Homogeneity of common cosmopolitan inversion frequencies in Southeast Asian <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0173-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>East Asian <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> are known for great variation in morphological and physiological characters among populations, variation that is believed to be maintained by genetic drift. To understand the genetic properties of Asian <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations, we initiated a population genetic study of chromosome inversion polymorphisms in hitherto unanalysed population samples from Southeast (SE) Asia. We generally found a high frequency of each of the four common cosmopolitan inversions in comparison to populations from Africa, Asia, and Australia. In contrast to the great phenotypic variation among Asian populations, however, we could not detect differences in inversion frequencies among populations. Furthermore, we observed neither correlations of inversion frequencies with population latitude and longitude, nor evidence for linkage disequilibrium between different inversion loci. We propose two explanations for the observed genetic homogeneity among these SE Asian <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations:</p>
					<ol type="roman">
						<li>the observed pattern simply reflects the retention of ancestral polymorphisms originating from a panmictic population that was once present on a large single landmass (Sundaland), and/or is a consequence of high recent gene flow between populations; and</li>
						<li>it is caused by selective forces (e.g. balancing selection).</li>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sexual isolation in <i>Drosophila</i> is typically measured by multiple-choice mating tests. While many environmental variables during such tests are controlled by the researcher, there are some factors that are usually uncontrolled. We demonstrate, using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>D. pseudoobscura</i> flies, that the temperature of rearing, preadult density, and level of consanguinity, can all produce differences in mating propensity between genetically equivalent flies. These differences in mating propensity, in turn, can give rise to statistically significant results in multiple-choice mating tests, leading to positive isolation values and the artifactual inference of sexual isolation between populations. This fact agrees with a nonrandom excess of significant positive tests found in a review of the literature of <i>Drosophila</i> intraspecific mating choice. An overestimate of true cases of sexual isolation in <i>Drosophila</i> in the literature can, therefore, not be ruled out.</p>

				<title>The <i>Hsp60C</i> gene in the 25F cytogenetic region in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is essential for tracheal development and fertility</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0265-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Earlier studies have shown that of the four genes (<i>Hsp60A, Hsp60B, Hsp60C, Hsp60D</i> genes) predicted to encode the conserved Hsp60 family chaperones in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the <i>Hsp60A</i> gene (at the 10A polytene region) is expressed in all cell types of the organism and is essential from early embryonic stages, while the <i>Hsp60B</i> gene (at 21D region) is expressed only in testis, being essential for sperm individualization. In the present study, we characterized the <i>Hsp60C</i> gene (at 25F region), which shows high sequence homology with the other three <i>Hsp60</i> genes of <i>D. melanogaster</i>. <i>In situ</i> hybridization of <i>Hsp60C</i>-specific riboprobe shows that expression of this gene begins in late embryonic stages (stage 14 onwards), particularly in the developing tracheal system and salivary glands; during larval and adult stages, it is widely expressed in many cell types but much more strongly in tracheae and in developing and differentiating germ cells. A P-insertion mutant (<i>Hsp60C$^{1}$</i>) allele with the P transposon inserted at $-251$ position of the <i>Hsp60C</i> gene promoter was generated. This early larval recessive lethal mutation significantly reduces levels of <i>Hsp60C</i> transcripts in developing tracheae and this is associated with a variety of defects in the tracheal system, including lack of liquid clearance. About 10\%\ of the homozygotes survive as weak, shortlived and completely sterile adults. Testes of the surviving mutant males are significantly smaller, with fewer spermatocytes, most of which do not develop beyond the round spermatid stage. <i>In situ</i> and Northern hybridizations show significantly reduced levels of the <i>Hsp60C</i> transcripts in <i>Hsp60C$^{1}$</i> homozygous adult males. The absence of early meiotic stages in the <i>Hsp60C$^{1}$</i> homozygous testes contrasts with the effect of testis-specific <i>Hsp60B</i> (21D) gene, whose mutation affects individualization of sperm bundles later in spermiogenesis. In view of the specific effects in tracheal development and in early stages of spermatogenesis, it is likely that, besides its functions as a chaperone, Hsp60C may have signalling functions and may also be involved in cation transport across the developing tracheal epithelial cells.</p>

				<title>Coexistence of three different <i>Drosophila</i> species by rescheduling their life history traits in a natural population</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0283-0293</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present evidence for coexistence of three different <i>Drosophila</i> species by rescheduling their life history traits in a natural population using the same resource, at the same time and same place. <i>D. ananassae</i> has faster larval development time (DT) and faster DT(egg-fly) than other two species thus utilizing the resources at maximum at both larval and adult stages respectively. Therefore, <i>D. ananassae</i> skips the interspecific competition at preadult stage but suffers more from intraspecific competition. However, <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. biarmipes</i> have rescheduled their various life history traits to avoid interspecific competition. Differences of ranks tests for various life history traits suggest that except for DT(egg-pupa), the difference of ranks is highest for the combination of <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. ananassae</i> for all other life history traits. This difference is maintained by tradeoffs between larval development time and pupal period and between pupal period and DT(egg-pupa) in <i>D. ananassae.</i></p>

				<title>Genetic diversity and bottleneck studies in the Marwari horse breed</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0295-0301</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic diversity within the Marwari breed of horses was evaluated using 26 different microsatellite pairs with 48 DNA samples from unrelated horses. This molecular characterisation was undertaken to evaluate the problem of genetic bottlenecks also, if any, in this breed. The estimated mean ($\pm$ s.e.) allelic diversity was 5.9 ($\pm$ 2.24), with a total of 133 alleles. A high level of genetic variability within this breed was observed in terms of high values of mean ($\pm$ s.e.) effective number of alleles (3.3 $\pm$ 1.27), observed heterozygosity (0.5306 $\pm$ 0.22), expected Levene’s heterozygosity (0.6612 $\pm$ 0.15), expected Nei’s heterozygosity (0.6535 $\pm$ 0.14), and polymorphism information content (0.6120 $\pm$ 0.03). Low values of Wright’s fixation index, $F_{\text{IS}}$ (0.2433 $\pm$ 0.05) indicated low levels of inbreeding. This basic study indicated the existence of substantial genetic diversity in the Marwari horse population. No significant genotypic linkage disequilibrium was detected across the population, suggesting no evidence of linkage between loci. A normal ‘L’ shaped distribution of mode–shift test, non-significant heterozygote excess on the basis of different models, as revealed from Sign, Standardized differences and Wilcoxon sign rank tests as well as non-significant $M$ ratio value suggested that there was no recent bottleneck in the existing Marwari breed population, which is important information for equine breeders. This study also revealed that the Marwari breed can be differentiated from some other exotic breeds of horses on the basis of three microsatellite primers.</p>

				<title>Genetics of adult plant stripe rust resistance in CSP44, a selection from Australian wheat</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0337-0340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wheat line CSP44, a selection from an Australian bread wheat cultivar Condor, has shown resistance to stripe rust in India since the last twenty years. Seedlings and adult plants of CSP44 showed susceptible infection types against stripe rust race 46S119 but displayed average terminal disease severity of 2.67 on adult plants against this race as compared to 70.33 of susceptible Indian cultivar, WL711. This suggests the presence of nonhypersensitive adult plant stripe rust resistance in the line CSP44. The evaluation of F$_{1}$, F$_{2}$ and F$_{3}$ generations and F$_{6}$ SSD families from the cross of CSP44 with susceptible wheat cultivar WL711 for stripe rust severity indicated that the resistance in CSP44 is based on two genes showing additive effect. One of these two genes is <i>Yr18</i> and the second gene is not yet described.</p>

				<title>Phenotypic plasticity of body size in a temperate population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: when the temperature–size rule does not apply</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0009-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A natural population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> in southern France was sampled in three different years and 10 isofemale lines were investigated from each sample. Two size-related traits, wing and thorax length, were measured and the wing/thorax ratio was also calculated. Phenotypic plasticity was analysed after development at seven different constant temperatures, ranging from 12$^{\circ}$C to 31$^{\circ}$C. The three year samples exhibited similar reaction norms, suggesting a stable genetic architecture in the natural population. The whole sample (30 lines) was used to determine precisely the shape of each reaction norm, using a derivative analysis. The practical conclusion was that polynomial adjustments could be used in all cases, but with different degrees: linear for the wing/thorax ratio, quadratic for thorax length, and cubic for wing length. Both wing and thorax length exhibited concave reaction norms, with a maximum within the viable thermal range. The temperatures of the maxima were, however, quite different, around 15$^{\circ}$C for the wing and 19.5$^{\circ}$C for the thorax. Assuming that thorax length is a better estimate of body size, it is not possible to state that increasing the temperature results in monotonically decreasing size (the temperature–size rule), although this is often seen to be the case for genetic variations in latitudinal clines. The variability of the traits was investigated at two levels—within and between lines—and expressed as a coefficient of variation. The within-line (environmental) variability revealed a regular, quadratic convex reaction norm for the three traits, with a minimum around 21$^{\circ}$C. This temperature of minimum variability may be considered as a physiological optimum, while extreme temperatures are stressful. The between-line (genetic) variability could also be adjusted to quadratic polynomials, but the curvature parameters were not significant. Our results show that the mean values of the traits and their variance are both plastic, but react in different ways along a temperature gradient. Extreme low or high temperatures decrease the size but increase the variability. These effects may be considered as a functional response to environmental stress.</p>

				<title>Introgressive hybridization and evolution of a novel protein phenotype: glue protein profiles in the <i>nasuta–albomicans</i> complex of <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0025-0030</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glue proteins are tissue-specific proteins synthesized by larval salivary gland cells of <i>Drosophila</i>. In <i>Drosophila nasuta nasuta</i> and <i>D. n. albomicans</i> of the <i>nasuta</i> subgroup, the genes that encode the major glue protein fractions are X-linked. In the present study, these X-linked markers have been employed to trace the pattern of introgression of <i>D. n. nasuta</i> and <i>D. n. albomicans</i> genomes with respect to the major glue protein fractions in their interracial hybrids, called cytoraces. These cytoraces have inherited the chromosomes of both parents and have been maintained in the laboratory for over 400–550 generations. The analysis has revealed that cytoraces with <i>D. n. albomicans</i> X chromosome show either <i>D. n. nasuta</i> pattern or a completely novel pattern of glue protein fractions. Further, quantitative analysis also shows lack of correlation between the chromosomal pattern of inheritance and overall quantity of the major glue protein fractions in the cytoraces. Thus, in cytoraces the parental chromosomes are not just differentially represented but there is evidence for introgression even at the gene level.</p>

				<title>Molecular phylogeny of silk-producing insects based on 16S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit I genes</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0031-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have examined the molecular-phylogenetic relationships between nonmulberry and mulberry silkwormspecies that belong to the families Saturniidae, Bombycidae and Lasiocampidae using 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (<i>coxI</i>) gene sequences. Aligned nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA and <i>coxI</i> from 14 silk-producing species were used for construction of phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods. The tree topology on the basis of 16S rRNA supports monophyly for members of Saturniidae and Bombycidae. Weighted parsimony analysis weighted towards transversions relative to transitions (ts, tv4) for <i>coxI</i> resulted in more robust bootstrap support over unweighted parsimony and favours the 16S rRNA tree topology. Combined analysis reflected clear biogeographic pattern, and agrees with morphological and cytological data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Karyotype structures of <i>Scenedesmus acuminatus</i> (Lagerch.) Chod. and <i>Scenedesmus pectinatus</i> Meyen are compared. The karyotype of <i>S. acuminatus</i> ($n = 5$) is described for the first time. It reveals four large metacentric and one large submetacentric chromosomes (4M + 1SM). The established karyotype differences have been helpful in clarifying the taxonomic position of these two species. The cytological analyses of other related clonal cultures suggest an evolutionary transition from <i>S. pectinatus</i> towards <i>S. regularis</i> through <i>S. pectinatus</i> f. <i>regularis</i>, which correlates with the morphological data about their variability. These results are discussed from the cytogenetic, morphological and evolutionary point of view. On the basis of the karyotypic analysis, it was confirmed that from a taxonomic point of view <i>S. pectinatus, S. acuminatus</i> and <i>S. regularis</i> are separate biological species.</p>

				<title>Genetic analyses of agronomic and seed quality traits of synthetic oilseed <i>Brassica napus</i> produced from interspecific hybridization of <i>B. campestris</i> and <i>B. oleracea</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0045-0051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The heritability, the number of segregating genes and the type of gene interaction of nine agronomic traits were analysed based on F$_{2}$ populations of synthetic oilseed <i>Brassica napus</i> produced from interspecific hybridization of <i>B. campestris</i> and <i>B. oleracea</i> through ovary culture. The nine traits—plant height, stem width, number of branches, length of main raceme, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, length of pod, seed weight per plant and 1000-seed weight—had heritabilities of 0.927, 0.215, 0.172, 0.381, 0.360, 0.972, 0.952, 0.516 and 0.987 respectively, while the mean numbers of controlling genes for these characters were 7.4, 10.4, 9.9, 12.9, 11.5, 21.7, 20.5, 19.8 and 6.4 respectively. According to estimated coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of the traits tested, no significant gene interaction was found for plant height, stem width, number of branches, length of main raceme, number of seeds per pod and 1000-seed weight. Seed yield per plant is an important target for oilseed production. In partial correlation analysis, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and 1000-seed weight were positively correlated with seed yield per plant. On the other hand, length of pod was negatively correlated ($r = -0.69$) with seed yield per plant. Other agronomic characters had no significant correlation to seed yield per plant. In this experiment, the linear regressions of seed yield per plant and other agronomic traits were also analysed. The linear regression equation was $y = 0.074x_{8} + 1.819x_{9} + 6.72x_{12} - 60.78 (R^{2} = 0.993)$, where $x_{8}$, $x_{9}$ and $x_{12}$ represent number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and 1000-seed weight respectively. The experiment also showed that erucic acid and oil contents of seeds from F$_{2}$ plants were lower than those of their maternal parents. However, glucosinolate content was higher than that of the maternal plants. As for protein content, similar results were found in the F$_{2}$ plants and their maternal parents. It was shown that the four quality traits, i.e. erucic acid, glucosinolate, oil content, and protein content, had heritability values of 0.614, 0.405, 0.153 and 0.680 respectively.</p>

				<title>Highly conserved D-loop-like nuclear mitochondrial sequences (Numts) in tiger (<i>Panthera tigris</i>)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0107-0116</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using oligonucleotide primers designed to match hypervariable segments I (HVS-1) of <i>Panthera tigris</i> mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we amplified two different PCR products (500 bp and 287 bp) in the tiger (<i>Panthera tigris</i>), but got only one PCR product (287 bp) in the leopard (<i>Panthera pardus</i>). Sequence analyses indicated that the sequence of 287 bp was a D-loop-like nuclear mitochondrial sequence (Numts), indicating a nuclear transfer that occurred approximately 4.8–17 million years ago in the tiger and 4.6–16 million years ago in the leopard. Although the mtDNA D-loop sequence has a rapid rate of evolution, the 287-bp Numts are highly conserved; they are nearly identical in tiger subspecies and only 1.742\%\ different between tiger and leopard. Thus, such sequences represent molecular ‘fossils’ that can shed light on evolution of the mitochondrial genome and may be the most appropriate outgroup for phylogenetic analysis. This is also proved by comparing the phylogenetic trees reconstructed using the D-loop sequence of snow leopard and the 287-bp Numts as outgroup.</p>

				<title>Genetic diversity studies of Kherigarh cattle based on microsatellite markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0117-0122</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report a genetic diversity study of Kherigarh cattle, a utility draught-purpose breed of India, currently declining at a startling rate, by use of microsatellite markers recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Microsatellite genotypes were derived, and allelic and genotypic frequencies, heterozygosities and gene diversity were estimated. A total of 131 alleles were distinguished by the 21 microsatellite markers used. All the microsatellites were highly polymorphic, with mean ($\pm$ s.e.) allelic number of 6.24 $\pm$ 1.7, ranging 4–10 per locus. The observed heterozygosity in the population ranged between 0.261 and 0.809, with mean ($\pm$ s.e.) of 0.574 $\pm$ 0.131, indicating considerable genetic variation in this population. Genetic bottleneck hypotheses were also explored. Our data suggest that the Kherigarh breed has not experienced a genetic bottleneck in the recent past.</p>

				<title>Morphological, yield, cytological and molecular characterization of a bread wheat $\times$ tritordeum F$_{1}$ hybrid</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0123-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The morphological, yield, cytological and molecular characteristics of bread wheat $\times$ tritordeum F$_{1}$ hybrids ($2n = 6x = 42$; AABBDH$^{\text{ch}}$) and their parents were analysed. Morphologically, these hybrids resembled the wheat parent. They were slightly bigger than both parents, had more spikelets per spike, and tillered more profusely. The hybrids are self-fertile but a reduction of average values of yield parameters was observed. For the cytological approach we used a double-target fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization performed with total genomic DNA from <i>Hordeum chilense</i> L. and the ribosomal sequence pTa71. This technique allowed us to confirm the hybrid nature and to analyse chromosome pairing in this material. Our results showed that the expected complete homologous pairing (14 bivalents plus 14 univalents) was only observed in 9.59\%\ of the pollen mother cells (PMCs) analysed. Some PMCs presented autosyndetic pairing of H$^{\text{ch}}$ and A, B or D chromosomes. The average number of univalents was higher in the wheat genome (6.8) than in the H$^{\text{ch}}$ genome (5.4). The maximum number of univalents per PMC was 20. We only observed wheat multivalents (one per PMC) but the frequency of trivalents (0.08) was higher than that of quadrivalents (0.058). We amplified 50 RAPD bands polymorphic between the F$_{1}$ hybrid and one of its parents, and 31 ISSR polymorphic bands. Both sets of markers proved to be reliable for DNA fingerprinting. The complementary use of morphological and yield analysis, molecular cytogenetic techniques and molecular markers allowed a more accurate evaluation and characterization of the hybrids analysed here.</p>

				<title>Homeotic-like modification of stamens to petals is associated with aberrant mitochondrial gene expression in cytoplasmic male sterile Ogura <i>Brassica juncea</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0133-0139</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have previously reported correction of severe leaf chlorosis in the cytoplasmic male sterile Ogura (also called Ogu) <i>Brassica juncea</i> line carrying Ogura cytoplasm by plastid substitution via protoplast fusion. Two cybrids obtained from the fusion experiment, Og1 and Og2, were green and carried the plastid genome of <i>B. juncea</i> cv. RLM198. While Og1 displayed normal flower morphology comparable to that of its euplasmic <i>B. juncea</i> counterpart except for sterile anthers, Og2 retained homeotic-like floral modification of stamens to petal-like structures and several other floral deformities observed in the chlorotic (Ogu) <i>B. juncea</i> cv. RLM198 (or OgRLM). With respect to the mitochondrial genome, Og1 showed 81\%\ genetic similarity to the fertile cultivar RLM while Og2 showed 93\%\ similarity to OgRLM. In spite of recombination and rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes in the cybrids, expression patterns of 10 out of 11 mitochondrial genes were similar in all the three CMS lines; the only exception was <i>atp6</i>, whose expression was altered. While Og1 showed normal <i>atp6</i> transcript similar to that in RLM, in Og2 and OgRLM weak expression of a longer transcript was detected. These results suggest that the homeotic-like changes in floral patterning leading to petaloid stamens in Og2 and OgRLM may be associated with aberrant mitochondrial gene expression.</p>

				<title>Microsatellite DNA typing for assessment of genetic variability in Tharparkar breed of Indian zebu (<i>Bos indicus</i>) cattle, a major breed of Rajasthan</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0165-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study estimates genetic variability with a set of 25 microsatellite markers in a random sample of 50 animals of Tharparkar breed of Indian zebu (<i>Bos indicus</i>) cattle. Tharparkar is a dual-purpose breed, valued for its milk as well as draught utility, and is adapted to the inhospitable Thar desert conditions of Rajasthan typified by summer temperature hovering above 50$^{\circ}$C, sparse rainfall and vegetation, and scarcity of even drinking water. The observed number of alleles ranged from 4 (ETH3, ILSTS030, INRA5, INRA63 and MM8) to 11 (HEL9 and ILSTS034), with allelic diversity (average number of observed alleles per locus) of 6.20. Observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.25 (INRA63) to 0.77 (ETH10), and from 0.51 (HEL5 and HAUT27) to 0.88 (HEL9) respectively. Wide range of genetic variability supported the utility of these microsatellite loci in measurement of genetic diversity indices in other Indian cattle breeds too. Various average genetic variability measures, namely allele diversity (6.20), observed heterozygosity (0.57), expected heterozygosity (0.67) and mean polymorphism information content (0.60) values showed substantial within-breed genetic variability in this major breed of Rajasthan, despite accumulated inbreeding as reflected by high average inbreeding coefficient $(F_{\text{IS}} = 0.39)$. The Tharparkar population has not experienced a bottleneck in the recent past.</p>

				<title>Cloning, characterization and promoter analysis of common carp <i>hairy/Enhancer-of-split</i>-related gene, <i>her6</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0171-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Some members of <i>hairy/Enhancer-of-split</i>-related gene (HES) family have important effects on axial mesoderm segmentation and the establishment and maintenance of the somite fringe. In fishes, the <i>her6</i> gene, a member of the HES family, is the homologue of <i>hes1</i> in mammals and chicken. In this study, the <i>her6</i> gene and its full-length cDNA from the common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) were isolated and characterized. The genomic sequence of common carp <i>her6</i> is approximately 1.7 kb, with four exons and three introns, and the full-length cDNA of 1314 bp encodes a putative polypeptide of 271 amino acids. To analyse the promoter sequence of common carp <i>her6</i>, sequences of various lengths upstream from the transcription initiation site of <i>her6</i> were fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (<i>eGFP</i>) and introduced into zebrafish embryos by microinjection to generate transgenic embryos. Our results show that the upstream sequence of 500 bp can direct highly efficient and tissue-specific expression of <i>eGFP</i> in zebrafish embryos, whereas a fragment of 200 bp containing the TATA box and a partial suppressor of hairless paired site sequence (SPS) is not sufficient to drive <i>eGFP</i> expression in zebrafish embryos.</p>

				<title>Recent integrations of mammalian <i>Hmg</i> retropseudogenes</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0179-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We propose that select retropseudogenes of the high mobility group nonhistone chromosomal protein genes have recently integrated into mammalian genomes on the basis of the high sequence identity of the copies to the cDNA sequences derived from the original genes. These include the <i>Hmg1</i> gene family in mice and the <i>Hmgn2</i> family in humans. We investigated orthologous loci of several strains and species of <i>Mus</i> for presence or absence of apparently young <i>Hmg1</i> retropseudogenes. Three of four analysed elements were specific to <i>Mus musculus</i>, two of which were not fixed, indicative of recent evolutionary origins. Additionally, we datamined a presumptive subfamily (<i>Hmgz</i>) of mouse <i>Hmg1</i>, but only identified one true element in the GenBank database, which is not consistent with a separate subfamily status. Two of four analysed <i>Hmgn2</i> retropseudogenes were specific for the human genome, whereas a third was identified in human, chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, and a fourth additionally found in orangutan but absent in African green monkey. Flanking target-site duplications were consistent with LINE integration sites supporting LINE machinery for their mechanism of amplification. The human <i>Hmgn2</i> retropseudogenes were full length, whereas the mouse <i>Hmg1</i> elements were either full length or $3'$-truncated at specific positions, most plausibly the result of use of alternative polyadenylation sites. The nature of their recent amplification success in relation to other retropseudogenes is unclear, although availability of a large number of transcripts during gametogenesis may be a reason. It is apparent that retropseudogenes continue to shape mammalian genomes, and may provide insight into the process of retrotransposition, as well as offer potential use as phylogenetic markers.</p>

				<title>Antioxidative response mechanisms in halophytes: their role in stress defence</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0237-0254</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Normal growth and development of plants is greatly dependent on the capacity to overcome environmental stresses. Environmental stress conditions like high salinity, drought, high incident light and low or high temperature cause major crop losses worldwide. A common denominator in all these adverse conditions is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within different cellular compartments of the plant cell. Plants have developed robust mechanisms including enzymatic or nonenzymatic scavenging pathways to counter the deleterious effects of ROS production. There are a number of general reviews on oxidative stress in plants and few on the role of ROS scavengers during stress conditions. Here we review the regulation of antioxidant enzymes during salt stress in halophytes, especially mangroves. We conclude that</p>
					<ol type="roman">
						<li>antioxidant enzymes protect halophytes from deleterious ROS production during salt stress, and</li>
						<li>genetic information from mangroves and other halophytes would be helpful in defining the roles of individual isoforms.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>This information would be critical in using the appropriate genes for oxidative stress defence for genetic engineering of enhanced stress tolerance in crop systems.</p>

				<title>A new method of testing for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and ordering populations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0001-0007</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) among alleles in a nonevolving population is of fundamental importance in genetic studies. Deviation from HWE in a population usually indicates inbreeding, stratification and sometimes problems in genotyping. In populations of affected individuals, these deviations can also provide evidence for association. In this paper, we introduce a measure based on the Kullback–Leibler discrimination information function that quantifies the deviation from HWE in a population. We use this measure to order populations. We also propose a test for HWE based on an estimate of this measure. The test is a statistically consistent test of the null hypothesis for all alternatives and is very easy to implement. Our proposed test statistic is compared with an earlier, widely used, test. Finally, the use of the proposed new test is shown in an illustrative example.</p>

				<title>Genetic structure of the rattan <i>Calamus thwaitesii</i> in core, buffer and peripheral regions of three protected areas in centralWestern Ghats, India: do protected areas serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0009-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Given the increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests, the various protected areas—national parks, sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves—serve as the last footholds for conserving biological diversity. However, because protected areas are often targeted for the conservation of selected species, particularly charismatic animals, concerns have been raised about their effectiveness in conserving nontarget taxa and their genetic resources. In this paper, we evaluate whether protected areas can serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants that are threatened due to extraction pressures. We examine the population structure and genetic diversity of an economically important rattan, <i>Calamus thwaitesii</i>, in the core, buffer and peripheral regions of three protected areas in the central Western Ghats, southern India. Our results indicate that in all the three protected areas, the core and buffer regions maintain a better population structure, as well as higher genetic diversity, than the peripheral regions of the protected area. Thus, despite the escalating pressures of extraction, the protected areas are effective in conserving the genetic resources of rattan. These results underscore the importance of protected areas in conservation of nontarget species and emphasize the need to further strengthen the protected-area network to offer refugia for economically important plant species.</p>

				<title>Chromosomal evolution and phylogenetic analyses in <i>Tayassu pecari</i> and <i>Pecari tajacu</i> (Tayassuidae): tales from constitutive heterochromatin</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0019-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mammalian family Tayassuidae (peccaries) is confined to the New World and comprises three recognized extant species, white-lipped (<i>Tayassu pecari</i>), collared (<i>Pecari tajacu</i>) and chacoan (<i>Catagonus wagneri</i>) peccaries, which exhibit distinct morphological and chromosomal features. The phylogenetic relationships among the tayassuids are unclear and have instigated debate over the palaeontological, cytogenetic and molecular aspects. Constitutive heterochromatin analysis can be used in understanding the phylogenetic relationships between related species. Here we describe, for the first time, the constitutive heterochromatin (C-positive heterochromatin) of two tayassuid species, <i>Tayassu pecari</i> and <i>Pecari tajacu</i>. We demonstrate that in <i>situ</i> restriction endonuclease digestion with sequential C-banding could be a complementary tool in the study of constitutive heterochromatin heterogeneity in chromosomes of the Tayassuidae. Our characterization of peccary chromosomes suggests that the <i>Pecari tajacu</i> autosomal karyotype is more primitive and has accumulated great diversity in its constitutive heterochromatin. This idea is supported by several other studies that analysed nuclear and mitochondrial sequences of the living peccary species. Finally, the tayassuid X chromosome primitive form seems to be the one of <i>Tayassu pecari</i>.</p>

				<title>Unique nucleotide polymorphism of ankyrin gene cluster in <i>Arabidopsis</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0027-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ankyrin (<i>ANK</i>) gene cluster is a part of a multigene family encoding ANK transmembrane proteins in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, and plays an important role in protein–protein interactions and in signal pathways. In contrast to other regions of a genome, the <i>ANK</i> gene cluster exhibits an extremely high level of DNA polymorphism in an $\sim 5$-kb region, without apparent decay. Phylogenetic analysis detects two clear, deeply differentiated haplotypes (dimorphism). The divergence between haplotypes of accession Col-0 and Ler-0 (Hap-C and Hap-L) is estimated to be 10.7\%, approximately equal to the 10.5\%\ average divergence between <i>A. thaliana</i> and <i>A. lyrata</i>. Sequence comparisons for the <i>ANK</i> gene cluster homologues in Col-0 indicate that the members evolve independently, and that the similarity among paralogues is lower than between alleles. Very little intralocus recombination or gene conversion is detected in <i>ANK</i> regions. All these characteristics of the <i>ANK</i> gene cluster are consistent with a tandem gene duplication and birth-and-death process. The possible mechanisms for and implications of this elevated nucleotide variation are also discussed, including the suggestion of balancing selection.</p>

				<title>Transposon display supports transpositional activity of $P$ elements in species of the <i>saltans</i> group of <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0037-0043</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mobilization of two $P$ element subfamilies (canonical and O-type) from <i>Drosophila sturtevanti</i> and <i>D. saltans</i> was evaluated for copy number and transposition activity using the transposon display (TD) technique. Pairwise distances between strains regarding the insertion polymorphism profile were estimated. Amplification of the $P$ element based on copy number estimates was highly variable among the strains (<i>D. sturtevanti</i>, canonical 20.11, O-type 9.00; <i>D. saltans</i>, canonical 16.4, O-type 12.60 insertions, on average). The larger values obtained by TD compared to our previous data by Southern blotting support the higher sensitivity of TD over Southern analysis for estimating transposable element copy numbers. The higher numbers of the canonical $P$ element and the greater divergence in its distribution within the genome of <i>D. sturtevanti</i> (24.8\%) compared to the O-type (16.7\%), as well as the greater divergence in the distribution of the canonical P element, between the <i>D. sturtevanti</i> (24.8\%) and the <i>D. saltans</i> (18.3\%) strains, suggest that the canonical element occupies more sites within the <i>D. sturtevanti</i> genome, most probably due to recent transposition activity. These data corroborate the hypothesis that the O-type is the oldest subfamily of $P$ elements in the <i>saltans</i> group and suggest that the canonical $P$ element is or has been transpositionally active until more recently in <i>D. sturtevanti.</i></p>

				<title>Meiosis in a triploid hybrid of <i>Gossypium</i>: high frequency of secondary bipolar spindles at metaphase II</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0045-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Studies on meiosis in pollen mother cells (PMCs) of a triploid interspecific hybrid ($3x = 39$ chromosomes, AAD) between tetraploid <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> ($4n = 2x = 52$,AADD) and diploid <i>G. arboreum</i> ($2n = 2x = 26$,AA) are reported. During meiotic metaphase I, 13 AA bivalents and 13 D univalents are expected in the hybrid. However, only 28\%\ of the PMCs had this expected configuration. The rest of the PMCs had between 8 and 12 bivalents and between 12 and 17 univalents. Univalents lagged at anaphase I, and at metaphase II one or a group of univalents remained scattered in the cytoplasm and failed to assemble at a single metaphase plate. Primary bipolar spindles organized around the bivalents and multivalents. In addition to the primary spindle, several secondary and smaller bipolar spindles organized themselves around individual univalents and groups of univalents. Almost all (97\%) of the PMCs showed secondary spindles. Each spindle functioned independently and despite their multiple numbers in a cell, meiosis I proceeded normally, with polyad formation. These observations strongly support the view that in plant meiocytes bilateral kinetochore symmetry is not required for establishing a bipolar spindle and that single unpaired chromosomes can initiate and stabilize the formation of a functional bipolar spindle.</p>

				<title>The costae presenting in high-temperature-induced <i>vestigial</i> wings of <i>Drosophila</i>: implications for anterior wing margin formation</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0051-0057</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has long been noted that high temperature produces great variation in wing forms of the <i>vestigial</i> mutant of <i>Drosophila</i>. Most of the wings have defects in the wing blade and partially formed wing margin, which are the result of autonomous cell death in the presumptive wing blade or costal region of the wing disc. The <i>vestigial</i> gene ($vg$) and the interaction of Vg protein with other gene products are well understood. With this biochemical knowledge, reinvestigations of the high-temperature-induced vestigial wings and the elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the large-scale variation of the wing forms may provide insight into further understanding of development of the wing of <i>Drosophila</i>. As a first step of such explorations, I examined high-temperature-induced (29$^{\circ}$C) vestigial wings. In the first part of this paper, I provide evidences to show that the proximal and distal costae in these wings exhibit regular and continuous variation, which suggests different developmental processes for the proximal and distal costal sections. Judging by the costae presenting in the anterior wing margin, I propose that the proximal and distal costal sections are independent growth units. The genes that regulate formation of the distal costal section also strongly affect proliferation of cells nearby; however, the same phenomenon has not been found in the proximal costal section. The distal costal section seems to be an extension of the radius vein. <i>vestigial</i>, one of the most intensely researched temperature-sensitive mutations, is a good candidate for the study of marginal vein formation. In the second part of the paper, I regroup the wing forms of these wings, chiefly by comparison of venation among these wings, and try to elucidate the variation of the wing forms according to the results of previous work and the conclusions reached in the first part of this paper, and provide clues for further researches.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0085-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>Sox9</i> gene is one of the important transcription factors in the development of many tissues and organs, particularly in sex determination and chondrogenesis. We amplified the genomic DNA of <i>Cyprinus carpio</i> using degenerate primers, and found that there were two versions of <i>Sox9</i> in this species: <i>Sox9a</i> and <i>Sox9b</i>, that differ in having an intron of different length (704 bp and 616 bp, respectively) in the conserved HMG box region that codes for identical amino acid sequences. We used a two-phase rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) for the isolation of full-length cDNA of <i>Sox9b</i>. Sequence analyses revealed a 2447-bp cDNA containing 233-bp $5'$ untranslated region, a 927-bp $3'$ untranslated region, including poly(A), and a 1287 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 428 amino acids. The HMG box of 79 amino acid motif was confirmed from positions 96–174. Sequence alignment showed that the identity of amino acids of <i>Sox9</i> among ten animal species, including <i>C. carpio</i>, is 75\%, indicating that the <i>Sox9</i> gene is evolutionarily quite conserved. The expression level of <i>Sox9b</i> gene varied among several organs of adult <i>C. carpio</i>, with the level of expression being highest in the brain and testis.</p>

				<title>A duplicated <i>coxI</i> gene is associated with cytoplasmic male sterility in an alloplasmic <i>Brassica juncea</i> line derived from somatic hybridization with <i>Diplotaxis catholica</i></title>

				<page>0093-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line of <i>Brassica juncea</i> was derived by repeated backcrossing of the somatic hybrid (<i>Diplotaxis catholica</i> + <i>B. juncea</i>) to <i>B. juncea</i>. The new CMS line is comparable to euplasmic lines for almost all characters, except for flowers which bear slender, needle-like anthers with aborted pollen. Detailed Southern analysis revealed two copies of <i>coxI</i> gene in the CMS line. One copy, coxI-1 is similar to the coxI gene of B. juncea, whereas the second copy, <i>coxI-2</i> is present in a novel rearranged region. Northern analysis with eight mitochondrial gene probes showed altered transcript pattern only for the <i>coxI</i> gene. Two transcripts of 2.0 and 2.4 kb, respectively, were detected in the CMS line. The novel 2.4 kb transcript was present in floral bud tissue but absent in the leaf tissue. In plants where male sterility broke down under high temperature during the later part of the growing season, the 2.4 kb <i>coxI</i> transcript was absent, which suggested its association with the CMS. The two <i>coxI</i> genes from the CMS line showed two amino acid changes in the coding region. The novel <i>coxI</i> gene showed unique repeats in the $5'$ region suggesting recombination of mitochondrial genomes of the two species. The possible role of the duplicated <i>coxI</i> gene in causing male sterility is discussed.</p>

				<title>Highly expressed genes are associated with inverse antisense transcription in mouse</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0103-0109</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is a growing evidence, that antisense transcription might have a key role in a range of human diseases. Although predefined sense–antisense pairs were extensively studied, the antisense expression of the known sense genes is rarely investigated. We retrieved and correlated the expression of sense and antisense sequences of 1182 mouse transcripts to assess the prevalence and to find the characteristic pattern of antisense transcription. We contrasted three Affymetrix MGU74A version 1 mouse genome chips to six MGU74A version 2 chips. For these 1182 transcripts, the version 1 chips contain the antisense sequences of the transcripts presented on the version 2 chips. The original data was taken from the GEO database (GDS431 and GDS432). As the Affymetrix data are semiquantitative, the relative expression levels of antisense partners were analysed. We detected antisense transcription, although the average antisense expression is shifted towards smaller expression values (MGU74A version 1, 516; version 2, 1688). An inverse direct correlation between sense and antisense expression values could be observed at high expression values. At a very high relative expression—above 40,000—the Pearson correlation coefficient is getting closer to −1. Transcripts with high inverse expression ratio may be correlated to the investigated gene (major histocompatibility complex class II <i>trans</i> activator). The ratio of sense to antisense transcripts varied among different chromosomes; on chromosomes 14 and 1 the level of antisense expression was higher than that of sense. We conclude that antisense transcription is a common phenomenon in the mouse genome. The hypothesis of regulatory role of antisense transcripts is supported by the inverse antisense gene expression of highly expressed genes.</p>

				<title>Complex genetic interactions govern the temporal effects of <i>Antennapedia</i> on antenna-to-leg transformations in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0111-0123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The putative regulatory relationships between <i>Antennapedia (Antp), spalt major (salm)</i> and <i>homothorax (hth)</i> are tested with regard to the sensitive period of antenna-to-leg transformations. Although Antp expression repressed <i>hth</i> as predicted, contrary to expectations, <i>hth</i> did not show increased repression at higher Antp doses, whereas <i>salm</i>, a gene downstream of <i>hth</i>, did show such a dose response. Loss of <i>hth</i> allowed antenna-to-leg transformations but the relative timing of proximal–distal transformations was reversed, relative to transformations induced by ectopic Antp. Finally, overexpression of Hth was only partially able to rescue transformations induced by ectopic Antp. These results indicate that there may be additional molecules involved in antenna/leg identity and that spatial, temporal and dosage relationships are more subtle than suspected and must be part of a robust understanding of molecular network behaviour involved in determining appendage identity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster.</i></p>

				<title>Nucleotide variation at the dopa decarboxylase (<i>Ddc</i>) gene in natural populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0125-0137</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We studied nucleotide sequence variation at the gene coding for dopa decarboxylase (<i>Ddc</i>) in seven populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Strength and pattern of linkage disequilibrium are somewhat distinct in the extensively sampled Spanish and Raleigh populations. In the Spanish population, a few sites are in strong positive association, whereas a large number of sites in the Raleigh population are associated nonrandomly but the association is not strong. Linkage disequilibrium analysis shows presence of two groups of haplotypes in the populations, each of which is fairly diverged, suggesting epistasis or inversion polymorphism. There is evidence of two forms of natural selection acting on <i>Ddc</i>. The McDonald–Kreitman test indicates a deficit of fixed amino acid differences between <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. simulans</i>, which may be due to negative selection. An excess of derived alleles at high frequency, significant according to the $H$-test, is consistent with the effect of hitchhiking. The hitchhiking may have been caused by directional selection downstream of the locus studied, as suggested by a gradual decrease of the polymorphism-to-divergence ratio. Altogether, the <i>Ddc</i> locus exhibits a complicated pattern of variation apparently due to several evolutionary forces. Such a complex pattern may be a result of an unusually high density of functionally important genes.</p>

				<title>Mapping autonomously replicating sequence elements in a 73-kb region of chromosome II of the fission yeast, <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0139-0148</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) elements are the genetic determinants of replication origin function in yeasts. They can be easily identified as the plasmids containing them transform yeast cells at a high frequency. As the first step towards identifying all potential replication origins in a 73-kb region of the long arm of fission yeast chromosome II, we have mapped five new ARS elements using systematic subcloning and transformation assay. 2D analysis of one of the ARS plasmids that showed highest transformation frequency localized the replication origin activity within the cloned genomic DNA. All the new ARS elements are localized in two clusters in centromere proximal 40 kb of the region. The presence of at least six ARS elements, including the previously reported <i>ars727</i>, is suggestive of a higher origin density in this region than that predicted earlier using a computer based search.</p>

				<title>Mesosternal bristle number in a cosmopolitan drosophilid: an X-linked variable trait independent of sternopleural bristles</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0149-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mesosternal (MS) bristles in <i>Drosophila</i> are a pair of machrochaetae found at the sternal end of the sternopleural (STP) microchaetae, and are thought to be invariable. In a closely related drosophilid genus, <i>Zaprionus</i>, their number is four and, in contrast to <i>Drosophila</i>, they show interspecific and intraspecific variability. The genetic basis of MS bristle number variability was studied in <i>Z. indianus</i>, the only cosmopolitan species of the genus. The trait responded rapidly to selection and two lines were obtained, one lacking any bristles (0-0) and the other bearing the normal phenotype (2-2). Other symmetrical phenotypes, (1-1) and (3-3), could also be selected for, but with lesser success. By contrast, STP bristle number did not vary significantly between the two lines (0-0) and (2-2), revealing its genetic independence from MS bristle number. Reciprocal crosses between these two lines showed that MS bristle number is mainly influenced by a major gene on the X chromosome (i.e. F$_{1}$ males always resembled their mothers) with codominant expression (i.e. heterozygous F$_{1}$ females harboured an average phenotype of 2 bristles). However, trait penetrance was incomplete and backcrosses revealed that this variability was partly due to genetic modifiers, most likely autosomal. The canalization of MS bristle number was investigated under different temperatures, and the increased appearance of abnormal phenotypes mainly occurred at extreme temperatures. There was a bias, however, towards bristle loss, as shown by a liability (developmental map) analysis. Finally, when ancestral and introduced populations were compared, the latter were far less stable, suggesting that genetic bottlenecks may perturb the MS bristle number canalization system. MS bristle number, thus, appears to be an excellent model for investigating developmental canalization at both the quantitative and the molecular level.</p>

				<title>Genetic variation and population structure of interleukin genes among seven ethnic populations from Karnataka, India</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0189-0194</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The extent of genetic variation and the degree of genetic differentiation among seven ethnic populations from Karnataka, India (Bunt, Havyak, Iyengar, Lingayath, Smartha, Vaishya, Vokkaliga), was investigated using four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: <i>IL-1A 4845, IL-1B 3954, IL-1B 511</i> and <i>IL-1RA 2018</i>) of the interleukin gene cluster. Allele frequencies varied by threefold among these populations, which also differed for gene diversity and heterozygosity levels. The average degree of population subdivision among these castes was low ($F_{ST} = 0.02$). However, pair-wise interpopulation differentiation ranged from 0–7\%, indicating no detectable differentiation to moderate differentiation between specific populations. The results of phylogenetic analysis based on genetic distances between populations agreed with known social and cultural data on these ethnic groups. Variation in the allele frequencies, as well as differentiation, may be attributed to differential selection and demographic factors including consanguinity among the ethnic groups. Information on the distribution of functionally relevant polymorphisms among ethnic populations may be important towards developing community medicine and public health policies.</p>

				<title>Mutations in the $S$ gene region of hepatitis B virus genotype $D$ in Turkish patients</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0195-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The $S$ gene region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for the expression of surface antigens and includes the ‘a’-determinant region. Thus, mutation(s) in this region would afford HBV variants a distinct survival advantage, permitting the mutant virus to escape from the immune system. The aim of this study was to search for mutations of the $S$ gene region in different patient groups infected with genotype $D$ variants of HBV, and to analyse the biological significance of these mutations. Moreover, we investigated $S$ gene mutation inductance among family members. Forty HBV-DNA-positive patients were determined among 132 hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) carriers by the first stage of seminested PCR. Genotypes and subtypes were established by sequencing of the amplified S gene regions. Variants were compared with original sequences of these serotypes, and mutations were identified. All variants were designated as genotype $D$ and subtype <i>ayw3</i>. Ten kinds of point mutations were identified within the $S$ region. The highest rates of mutation were found in chronic hepatitis patients and their family members. The amino acid mutations 125 (M $\to$ T) and 127 (T $\to$ P) were found on the first loop of ‘a’-determinant. The other consequence was mutation inductance in a family member. We found some mutations in the S gene region known to be stable and observed that some of these mutations affected $S$ gene expression.</p>

				<title><i>Drosophila simulans Lethal hybrid rescue</i> mutation (<i>Lhr</i>) rescues inviable hybrids by restoring X chromosomal dosage compensation and causes fluctuating asymmetry of development</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0203-0215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>Drosophila simulans Lhr</i> rescues lethal hybrids from the cross of <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. simulans</i>. We describe here, the phenotypes of <i>Lhr</i> dependent rescue hybrids and demonstrate the effects of <i>Lhr</i> on functional morphology of the salivary chromosomes in the hybrids. Our results reveal that the phenotypes of the ‘<i>Lhr</i> dependent rescued’ hybrids were largely dependent on the genetic background and the dominance in species and hybrids, and not on <i>Lhr</i>. Cytological examination reveal that while the salivary chromosome of ‘larval lethal’ male carrying <i>melanogaster</i> X chromosome was unusually thin and contracted, in ‘rescued’ hybrid males (C$_{mel}$X$_{mel}$Y$_{sim}$;A$_{mel}$A$_{sim}$) the X chromosome showed typical pale staining, enlarged diameter and incorporated higher rate of $^{3}$H-uridine in presence of one dose <i>Lhr</i> in the genome. In hybrid males carrying <i>simulans</i> X chromosome (C$_{mel}$X$_{sim}$Y$_{mel}$;A$_{mel}$A$_{sim}$), enlarged width of the polytene X chromosome was noted in most of the nuclei, in <i>Lhr</i> background, and transcribed at higher rate than that of the single X chromosome of male. In hybrid females (both viable, e.g., C$_{mel}$ X$_{mel}$ X$_{sim}$; A$_{mel}$ A$_{sim}$ and rescued, e.g., C$_{mel}$ X$_{mel}$ X$_{mel}$; A$_{mel}$ A$_{sim}$), the functional morphology of the X chromosomes were comparable to that of diploid autosomes in presence of one dose of <i>Lhr</i>. In hybrid metafemales, (C$_{mel}$X$_{mel}$X$_{mel}$X$_{sim}$; A$_{mel}$A$_{sim}$), two dose of <i>melanogaster</i> X chromosomes and one dose of <i>simulans</i> X chromosome were transcribed almost at ‘female’ rate in hybrid genetic background in presence of one dose of <i>Lhr</i>. In rescued hybrid males, the <i>melanogaster</i>-derived X chromosome appeared to complete its replication faster than autosomes. These results together have been interpreted to have suggested that <i>Lhr</i> suppresses the lethality of hybrids by regulating functional activities of the X chromosome(s) for dosage compensation.</p>

				<title>Male accessory gland secretory protein polymorphism in natural populations of <i>Drosophila nasuta nasuta</i> and <i>Drosophila sulfurigaster neonasuta</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0217-0224</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Male accessory gland secretory protein polymorphism was analysed in natural populations of <i>Drosophila nasuta nasuta</i> and <i>D. sulfurigaster neonasuta</i> for the first time, using SDS-PAGE to score polymorphism of these proteins in 2788 individuals of <i>D. n. nasuta</i> and 2232 individuals of <i>D. s. neonasuta</i> from 12 different populations from southern India. A total of 25 and 18 variant protein phenotypes were identified in <i>D. n. nasuta</i> and <i>D. s. neonasuta</i>, respectively. Protein fractions of group III were more polymorphic than those from groups I and II. The results show that accessory gland secretory proteins show high levels of polymorphism, irrespective of species or habitat. Moreover, we have used the variation in the accessory gland proteins to assess the extent of divergence between the species and to infer their population structure. The study suggests that though both <i>D. n. nasuta</i> and <i>D. s. neonasuta</i> belong to the same subgroup, they differ in population structure, as far as accessory gland protein polymorphism is concerned.</p>

				<title>Patterns of nucleotide sequence variation in <i>ICAM1</i> and <i>TNF</i> genes in twelve ethnic groups of India: roles of demographic history and natural selection</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0225-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied DNA sequence variation in and around the genes <i>ICAM1</i> and <i>TNF</i>, which play functional and correlated roles in inflammatory processes and immune cell responses, in 12 diverse ethnic groups of India, with a view to investigating the relative roles of demographic history and natural selection in shaping the observed patterns of variation. The total numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected at the <i>ICAM1</i> and <i>TNF</i> loci were 29 and 12, respectively. Haplotype and allele frequencies differed significantly across populations. The site frequency spectra at these loci were significantly different from those expected under neutrality, and showed an excess of intermediate-frequency variants consistent with balancing selection. However, as expected under balancing selection, there was no significant reduction of $F_{ST}$ values compared to neutral autosomal loci. Mismatch distributions were consistent with population expansion for both loci. On the other hand, the phylogenetic network among haplotypes for the <i>TNF</i> locus was similar to expectations under population expansion, while that for the <i>ICAM1</i> was as expected under balancing selection. Nucleotide diversity at the <i>ICAM1</i> locus was an order of magnitude lower in the promoter region, compared to the introns or exons, but no such difference was noted for the <i>TNF</i> gene. Thus, we conclude that the pattern of nucleotide variation in these genes has been modulated by both demographic history and selection. This is not surprising in view of the known allelic associations of several polymorphisms in these genes with various diseases, both infectious and noninfectious.</p>

				<title>Isolation, characterization and genetic analysis of canine <i>GATA4</i> gene in a family of Doberman Pinschers with an atrial septal defect</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0241-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>GATA4</i> is expressed early in the developing heart where it plays a key role in regulating the expression of genes encoding myocardial contractile proteins. Gene mutations in the human <i>GATA4</i> have been implicated in various congenital heart defects (CHD), including atrial septal defect (ASD). Although ASD is the third most common CHD in humans, it is generally rare in dogs and cats. There is also no obvious predilection for ASD in dogs and cats, based on sex or breed. However, among dogs, the incidence rate of ASD is relatively high in Samoyeds and Doberman Pinschers, where its inheritance and genetic aetiology are not well understood. In this study, we identified and investigated the genetic aetiology of an ASD affected family in a pure breed dog population. Although the <i>GATA4</i> gene was screened, we did not find any mutations that would result in the alteration of the coding sequence and hence, the predicted <i>GATA4</i> structure and function. Although the aetiology of ASD is multifactorial, our findings indicate that <i>GATA4</i> may not be responsible for the ASD in the dogs used in this study. However, this does not eliminate <i>GATA4</i> as a candidate for ASD in other dog breeds.</p>

				<title>Origin of new <i>Brassica</i> types from a single intergeneric hybrid between <i>B. rapa</i> and <i>Orychophragmus violaceus</i> by rapid chromosome evolution and introgression</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0249-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many novel lines were established from an intergeneric mixoploid between <i>Brassica rapa</i> ($2n = 20$) and <i>Orychophragmus violaceus</i> ($2n = 24$) through successive selections for fertility and viability. Pedigrees of individual F$_{2}$ plants were advanced to the 10th generation by selfing. Their breeding habit was self-compatible and different from the self-incompatibility of their female parent <i>B. rapa</i>, and these lines were reproductively isolated to different degrees from <i>B. rapa</i> and <i>B. napus</i>. The lines with high productivity showed not only a wide spectrum of phenotypes but also obvious variations in fatty acid profiles of seed oil and glucosinolate contents in seed meal. These lines had $2n = 36$, 37, 38, 39 and 40, with $2n = 38$ being most frequent (64.56\%), and no intact <i>O. violaceus</i> chromosomes were detected by genomic <i>in situ</i> hybridization (GISH) analysis. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses revealed a high extent of variation in genomic compositions across all the lines. <i>O. violaceus</i>-specific bands, deleted bands in <i>B. rapa</i> and novel bands for two parents were detected in these lines, with novel bands being the most frequent. The morphological and genetic divergence of these novel types derived from a single hybrid is probably due to rapid chromosomal evolution and introgression, and provides new genetic resources for rapeseed breeding.</p>

				<page>0259-0268</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An integrated genetic linkage map of the medicinal and ornamental plant <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>, based on different types of molecular and morphological markers was constructed, using a F$_{2}$ population of 144 plants. The map defines 14 linkage groups (LGs) and consists of 131 marker loci, including 125 molecular DNA markers (76 RAPD, 3 RAPD combinations; 7 ISSR; 2 EST-SSR from <i>Medicago truncatula</i> and 37 other PCR based DNA markers), selected from a total of 472 primers or primer pairs, and six morphological markers (stem pigmentation, leaf lamina pigmentation and shape, leaf petiole and pod size, and petal colour). The total map length is 1131.9 cM (centiMorgans), giving an average map length and distance between two markers equal to 80.9 cM and 8.6 cM, respectively. The morphological markers/genes were found linked with nearest molecular or morphological markers at distances varying from 0.7 to 11.4 cM. Linkage was observed between the morphological markers concerned with lamina shape and petiole size of leaf on LG1 and leaf, stem and petiole pigmentation and pod size on LG8. This is the first genetic linkage map of <i>C. roseus</i>.</p>

				<title>Association study of the oestrogen signalling pathway genes in relation to age at natural menopause</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0269-0276</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic factors play a significant role in influencing the variation of age at natural menopause (AANM). Estrogen receptor $\beta$ (<i>ESR2</i>), is an important factor in the mechanism of action of estrogen, while the aromatase gene (<i>CYP19</i>) and the 17-alpha-hydroxylase gene (<i>CYP17</i>) are involved in the biosynthesis of estrogen. We tested whether polymorphisms of <i>ESR2, CYP19</i> and <i>CYP17</i> genes are associated with AANM in Caucasian females. A total of 52 SNPs (17 for <i>ESR2</i>, 28 for <i>CYP19</i>, and 7 for <i>CYP17</i>) were successfully genotyped for 229 Caucasian women having experienced natural menopause. Comprehensive statistical analyses focusing on the association of these genes with AANM were conducted. The effects of age, height and age at menarche on AANM were adjusted when conducting association analyses. We found that six SNPs (2, 6-7, 9, 13 and 16) within <i>ESR2</i> were not significantly associated with AANM after Bonferroni correction. However, two blocks of <i>ESR2</i> were associated with AANM. For <i>CYP19</i>, two SNPs (24 and 27) were nominally associated with AANM. No significant association was observed between <i>CYP17</i> and AANM. Our results suggest that genetic variation in the <i>ESR2</i> and <i>CYP19</i> genes may influence the variation in AANM in Caucasian women.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0003-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analyses of frequency profiles of markers on disease or drug-response related genes in diverse populations are important for the dissection of common diseases. We report the results of analyses of data on 405 SNPs from 75 such genes and a 5.2 Mb chromosome, 22 genomic region in 1871 individuals from diverse 55 endogamous Indian populations. These include 32 large ($\gt$10 million individuals) and 23 isolated populations, representing a large fraction of the people of India. We observe high levels of genetic divergence between groups of populations that cluster largely on the basis of ethnicity and language. Indian populations not only overlap with the diversity of HapMap populations, but also contain population groups that are genetically distinct. These data and results are useful for addressing stratification and study design issues in complex traits especially for heterogeneous populations.</p>

				<title><i>Eucalyptus</i> microsatellites mined in <i>silico</i>: survey and evaluation</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0021-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Eucalyptus</i> is an important short rotation pulpy woody plant, grown widely in the tropics. Recently, many genomic programmes are underway leading to the accumulation of voluminous genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences in public databases. These sequences can be utilized for analysis of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) available in the transcribed genes. In this study, <i>in silico</i> analysis of 15,285 sequences representing partial and full-length mRNA from <i>Eucalyptus</i> species for their use in developing SSRs or microsatellites were carried out. A total of 875 EST-SSRs were identified from 772 SSR containing ESTs. Motif size of 6 for dinucleotide and 5 for trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, and pentanucleotides were considered in locating the microsatellites. The average frequency of identified SSRs was 12.9\%. The dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant among the dinucleotide, trinucleotide and tetranucleotide motifs and accounted for 50.9\%\ of the <i>Eucalyptus</i> genome. Primer designing analysis showed that 571 sequences with SSRs had sufficient flanking regions for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer synthesis. Evaluation of the usefulness of the SSRs showed that EST-derived SSRs can generate polymorphic markers as all the primers showed allelic diversity among the 16 provenances of <i>E. tereticornis.</i></p>

				<title>Desynapsis and precocious cytokinesis in <i>Brachiaria humidicola</i> (Poaceae) compromise meiotic division</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0027-0031</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The forage grass species <i>Brachiaria humidicola</i> is native to African savannas. Owing to its good adaptation to poorly drained and infertile acid soils, it has achieved wide utilization for pastures in Brazilian farms. Among the 55 accessions of <i>B. humidicola</i> analysed from the Embrapa Beef Cattle collection, one (H022), presented desynapsis and an abnormal pattern of cytokinesis in the first meiotic division. Among 28 inflorescences analysed in this accession, 12 were affected by the anomaly. In affected meiocytes, the first cytokinesis occurred in metaphase I and was generally perpendicular to a wide-metaphase plate, dividing the genome into two parts with an equal or unequal number of chromosomes. The normal cytokinesis after telophase I did not occur, and the meiocytes entered metaphase II, progressing to the end of meiosis with the occurrence of the second cytokinesis. As the first cytokinesis occurred precociously, whereas the second was normal, tetrads were formed but with unbalanced chromosome numbers in microspores. Abnormal cytokinesis occurred only in those meiocytes that underwent desynapsis after diakinesis. The implications of this abnormality in the <i>Brachiaria</i> breeding programme are discussed.</p>

				<title>Meiotic behaviour in three interspecific three-way hybrids between <i>Brachiaria ruziziensis</i> and <i>B. brizantha</i> (Poaceae: Paniceae)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0033-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The meiotic behaviour of three three-way interspecific promising hybrids (H17, H27, and H34) was evaluated. These hybrids resulted from the crosses between <i>B. ruziziensis</i> $\times$ <i>B. brizantha</i> and crossed to another <i>B. brizantha</i>. Two half-sib hybrids (H27 and H34) presented an aneuploid chromosome number ($2n = 4x = 33$), whereas hybrid H17 was a tetraploid ($2n = 4x = 36$), as expected. Chromosome paired predominantly as multivalents suggesting that genetic recombination and introgression of specific target genes from <i>B. brizantha</i> into <i>B. ruziziensis</i> can be expected. Arrangement of parental genomes in distinct metaphase plates was observed in H27 and H34, which have different male genitors. Hybrids H17 and H34 have the same male genitor, but did not display this abnormality. In H17, abnormalities were more frequent from anaphase II, when many laggard chromosomes appeared, suggesting that each genome presented a different genetic control for meiotic phase timing. Despite the phylogenetic proximity among these two species, these three hybrids presented a high frequency of meiotic abnormalities, mainly those related to irregular chromosome segregation typical of polyploids, H34, 69.1\%; H27, 56.1\%\ and H17, 44.9\%. From the accumulated results obtained through cytological studies in <i>Brachiaria hybrids</i>, it is evident that cytogenetical analysis is of prime importance in determining which genotypes can continue in the process of cultivar development and which can be successfully used in the breeding. Hybrids with high frequency of meiotic abnormalities can seriously compromise seed production, a key trait in assuring adoption of a new apomictic cultivar of <i>Brachiaria</i> for pasture formation.</p>

				<title>Simple sequence repeat marker development and genetic mapping in quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0039-0051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quinoa is a regionally important grain crop in the Andean region of South America. Recently quinoa has gained international attention for its high nutritional value and tolerances of extreme abiotic stresses. DNA markers and linkage maps are important tools for germplasm conservation and crop improvement programmes. Here we report the development of 216 new polymorphic SSR (simple sequence repeats) markers from libraries enriched for GA, CAA and AAT repeats, as well as 6 SSR markers developed from bacterial artificial chromosome-end sequences (BES-SSRs). Heterozygosity (H) values of the SSR markers ranges from 0.12 to 0.90, with an average value of 0.57. A linkage map was constructed for a newly developed recombinant inbred lines (RIL) population using these SSR markers. Additional markers, including amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), two 11S seed storage protein loci, and the nucleolar organizing region (NOR), were also placed on the linkage map. The linkage map presented here is the first SSR-based map in quinoa and contains 275 markers, including 200 SSR. The map consists of 38 linkage groups (LGs) covering 913 cM. Segregation distortion was observed in the mapping population for several marker loci, indicating possible chromosomal regions associated with selection or gametophytic lethality. As this map is based primarily on simple and easily-transferable SSR markers, it will be particularly valuable for research in laboratories in Andean regions of South America.</p>

				<title><i>GJB2</i> and mitochondrial A1555G gene mutations in nonsyndromic profound hearing loss and carrier frequencies in healthy individuals</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0053-0057</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study aimed to assess mutations in <i>GJB2</i> gene (connexin 26), as well as A1555G mitochondrial mutation in both the patients with profound genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss and healthy controls. Ninety-five patients with profound hearing loss ($\gt$90 dB) and 67 healthy controls were included. All patients had genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss. Molecular analyses were performed for connexin 26 (35delG, M34T, L90P, R184P, delE120, 167delT, 235delC and IVS1+1 A $\to$ G) mutations, and for mitochondrial A1555G mutation. Twenty-two connexin 26 mutations were found in 14.7\%\ of the patients, which were 35delG, R184P, del120E and IVS1+1 A $\to$ G. Mitochondrial A1555G mutation was not encountered. The most common <i>GJB2</i> gene mutation was 35delG, which was followed by del120E, IVS1+1 A $\to$ G and R184P, and 14.3\%\ of the patients segregated with DFNB1. In consanguineous marriages, the most common mutation was 35delG. The carrier frequency for 35delG mutation was 1.4\%\ in the controls. 35delG and del120E populations, seems the most common connexin 26 mutations that cause genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss in this country. Nonsyndromic hearing loss mostly shows DFNB1 form of segregation.</p>

				<title>Fine-scale genetic characterization of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> chromosome 7 encompassing the antigenic <i>var</i> and the drug-resistant <i>pfcrt</i> genes</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The fact that malaria is still an uncontrolled disease is reflected by the genetic organization of the parasite genome. Efforts to curb malaria should begin with proper understanding of the mechanism by which the parasites evade human immune system and evolve resistance to different antimalarial drugs. We have initiated such a study and presented herewith the results from the in <i>silico</i> understanding of a seventh chromosomal region of the malarial parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> encompassing the antigenic <i>var</i> genes (coding <i>pfemp1</i>) and the drug-resistant gene <i>pfcrt</i> located at a specified region of the chromosome 7. We found 60 genes of various functions and lengths, majority (61.67\%) of them were performing known functions. Almost all the genes have orthologs in other four species of <i>Plasmodium</i>, of which <i>P. chabaudi</i> seems to be the closest to <i>P. falciparum</i>. However, only two genes were found to be paralogous. Interestingly, the drug-resistant gene, <i>pfcrt</i> was found to be surrounded by seven genes coding for several CG proteins out of which six were reported to be responsible for providing drug resistance to <i>P. vivax</i>. The intergenic regions, in this specified region were generally large in size, majority (73\%) of them were of more than 500 nucleotide bp length. We also designed primers for amplification of 21 noncoding DNA fragments in the whole region for estimating genetic diversity and inferring the evolutionary history of this region of <i>P. falciparum</i> genome.</p>

				<title>Molecular assessment of genetic diversity in mung bean germplasm</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0065-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>RAPD profiles were used to identify the extent of diversity among 54 accessions of mung bean that included both improved and local land races. Out of the 40 primers screened, seven primers generated 174 amplification products with an average of 24.85 bands per primer. The RAPD profiles were analysed for Jaccard’s similarity coefficients that was found to be in the range from 0 to 0.48, indicating the presence of wide range of genetic diversity at molecular level. Cluster analysis was carried out based on distances (1-similarity coefficient) using neighbour-joining method in Free Tree package. The dendrogram resolved all the accessions into two major clusters, I (with 11 accessions) and II (with 43 accessions). However, the cluster was further divided into four subclusters (II A with six, II B with nine, II C with 15 and II D with 13 accessions). The distribution of the accessions in different clusters and subclusters appeares to be related to their performance in field conditions for 10 morphological traits that were scored. This study indicated that the RAPD profiles provide an easy and simple technique for preliminary genetic diversity assessment of mung bean accessions that may reflect morphological trait differences among them.</p>

				<title>Novel non-HLA-susceptible regions determined by meta-analysis of four genomewide scans for ankylosing spondylitis</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0075-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We identified novel non-HLA-susceptible regions for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) by applying the genome-search-meta-analysis (GSMA) method to combine the previous four AS genomewide scan studies including 479 families with 1175 affected individuals. Three original genomescans were mainly analysed for Caucasian families and one analysed for Han Mongolian families. Ten bins had both Psumrnk and Pord $\lt$ 0.05, suggesting these bins most likely contain AS-linked loci. The 10 bins are 6.2, 16.3, 6.1, 3.3, 6.3, 16.4, 10.5, 17.1, 2.5 and 2.9. The most significant result of linkage was on chromosome 6p22.3–p21.1 (bin 6.2, Psumrnk $\lt$ 0.000417), where HLA loci are located. By addition of a genome scan of Chinese origin, our GSMA result further confirmed the HLA loci as the greatest susceptible region to AS and suggested that non-HLA loci chromosome 16q, 3p, 10q, 2p, 2q and 17p, may also contain AS-linked loci. The novel loci identified in our result give hints to further studies.	</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0109-0117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>OTK18 is a human transcriptional suppressor implicated in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type-one infection of mononuclear phagocytes. It is ubiquitously expressed in all normal tissues, but its normal homeostatic function is yet to be characterized. One hypothesis is that OTK18 aids in the regulation of the innate immune system. To test this hypothesis, cDNA microarray analysis was performed on the total RNA extracted from <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> embryonic Schneider 2 (S2) cells transfected with either <i>pEGFP-OTK18</i> (enhanced green fluorescent protein) or empty vector controls (<i>pEGFP-N3</i>) for 6, 12 and 24 h. cDNA microarray analysis revealed differential expression of genes known to be important in regulation of <i>Drosophila</i> innate immunity. The expression levels of two genes, <i>Metchnikowin</i> and <i>CG16708</i> were verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. These results suggest a role for OTK18 in innate immunity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chromosome identification is essential in oyster genomic research. Fluorescence in <i>situ</i> hybridization (FISH) offers new opportunities for the identification of oyster chromosomes. It has been used to locate satellite DNAs, telomeres or ribosomal DNA sequences. However, regarding chromosome identification, no study has been conducted with simple sequence repeats (SSRs). FISH was used to probe the physical organization of three particular SSRs, (GGAT)$_{4}$, (GT)$_{7}$ and (TA)$_{10}$ onto metaphase chromosomes of the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>. Hybridization signals were observed in all the SSR probes, but the distribution and intensity of signals varied according to the oligonucleotide repeat. The intercalary, centromeric and telomeric bands were observed along the chromosomes, and for each particular repeat every chromosome pair presented a similar pattern, allowing karyotypic analysis with all the SSRs tested. Our study is the first in mollusks to show the application of SSR in <i>situ</i> hybridization for chromosome identification and karyotyping. This technique can be a useful tool for oyster comparative studies and to understand genome organization in different oyster taxa.</p>

				<title>A search for transmission ratio distortions in offspring from crosses between inbred mice</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0127-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Equal transmission of the two alleles at a locus from a heterozygote parent to the offspring is rarely violated. Beside the differential embryonic mortality, nondisjunction and gene conversion that are rather irregular forms of transmission–ratio distortion (TRD), there are two major forms of departure from Mendelian segregation. The first, found in females, based on the asymmetric nature of female meiosis, is usually referred to as meiotic drive, and has been well documented in a few cases. The second is segregation distortion found in males. There are several known male-related segregation distortion systems that are caused by different fertilizing capacity of sperm cells carrying alternative alleles at a particular locus. Observation of TRD effects requires a sufficient number of offspring produced by a parental pair. As individuals in a population most likely have different genotypes in TRD affecting loci, the total transmission ratio is close to the expected Mendelian ratio and masks potential TRD effects. Highly inbred strains of laboratory mice provide a very good model for studying this phenomenon, because comparing two mice strains is effectively similar as comparison of two individuals in a population. This study tests both forms of TRD in progeny of F$_{1}$ hybrids from reciprocal crosses of inbred mice. Three previously unknown instances of TRD in females were observed. Therefore, this study concludes that some genes in females may carry alleles that can cause segregation distortion.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The exact localization of an insertion in the genome of transgenic plants obtained by <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation is an integral part of most experiments aimed at studying these types of mutants. There are several methods for isolating unknown nucleotide sequences of genomic DNA which flank the borders of T-DNA integrated in the genome of plants. However, all the methods based on PCR have limitations which in some cases do not permit the desired objective to be achieved. We have developed a new technique for isolating flanking sequence tags (FSTs) via modified inverse PCR. This method is highly efficient and simple, but also retains the advantages of previously well-documented approaches.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0141-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The gene <i>EG:22E5.5</i> or <i>CG4199</i> (accession number O77266, Q9W529) from Berkeley <i>Drosophila</i> Genome Project (BDGP) was found using the partial amino acid sequences of three tryptic peptides obtained from purified <i>Drosophila virilis</i> diaphorase-1. This gene is located on the X chromosome at position 2C9–2C10. The structure of the gene reveals three exons and two long introns. Using BDGP, we found six transcripts in this gene. The difference between these transcripts is in their $5'$ ends; the $3'$ ends of the six transcripts are identical. Thirty-four ESTs from different cDNA libraries were found, most of them from Schneider L2 cell culture (SH) cDNA library. The transcripts are represented at very low level in the cells of different organs and at different stages of <i>Drosophila</i> development. Using RT-PCR, we obtained five of these transcripts in cDNA samples from female adult flies. However, we could not find any of them in cDNA samples from male adult flies. Moreover, we obtained only the third transcript (CG4199-RC) in the sample of testis from adult flies and the fourth transcript (CG4199-RD) in an embryo sample. None of the other five transcripts were found in the samples of different organs and in the samples obtained at different stages of <i>Drosophila</i> development.</p>

				<title>Human oocyte chromosome analysis: complicated cases and major pitfalls</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0147-0153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Human oocytes that remained unfertilized in programmes of assisted reproduction have been analysed cytogenetically for more than 20 years to assess the incidence of aneuploidy in female gametes. However, the results obtained so far are not indisputable as a consequence of difficulties in evaluating oocyte chromosome preparations. Because of the lack of guidelines, we decided to summarize for the first time, the possible pitfalls in human oocyte chromosome analysis. Therefore, we screened the material from our previous studies and compiled representative, complicated cases with recommendations for their cytogenetic classification. We point out that maturity and size of the oocyte are important parameters and that fixation artefacts, as well as the particular structure of oocyte chromosomes, may predispose one to misinterpretations. Moreover, phenomena related to oocyte activation and fertilization are illustrated and explained. This compilation may help to avoid major problems in future studies and contribute to a more precise, and uniform assessment of human oocyte chromosomes.</p>

				<title>Mapping quantitative trait loci for binary trait in the F$_{2:3}$ design</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0201-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the analysis of inheritance of quantitative traits with low heritability, an F$_{2:3}$ design that genotypes plants in F$_{2}$ and phenotypes plants in F$_{2:3}$ progeny is often used in plant genetics. Although statistical approaches for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the F$_{2:3}$ design have been well developed, those for binary traits of biological interest and economic importance are seldom addressed. In this study, an attempt was made to map binary trait loci (BTL) in the F$_{2:3}$ design. The fundamental idea was: the F$_{2}$ plants were genotyped, all phenotypic values of each F$_{2:3}$ progeny were measured for binary trait, and these binary trait values and the marker genotype informations were used to detect BTL under the penetrance and liability models. The proposed method was verified by a series of Monte–Carlo simulation experiments. These results showed that maximum likelihood approaches under the penetrance and liability models provide accurate estimates for the effects and the locations of BTL with high statistical power, even under of low heritability. Moreover, the penetrance model is as efficient as the liability model, and the F$_{2:3}$ design is more efficient than classical F$_{2}$ design, even though only a single progeny is collected from each F$_{2:3}$ family. With the maximum likelihood approaches under the penetrance and the liability models developed in this study, we can map binary traits as we can do for quantitative trait in the F$_{2:3}$ design.</p>

				<title>Adaptation to different climates results in divergent phenotypic plasticity of wing size and shape in an invasive drosophilid</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0209-0217</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phenotypic plasticity of wing size and wing shape of <i>Zaprionus indianus</i> was investigated in relation to growth temperature (17$^{\circ}$C to 31$^{\circ}$C) in two natural populations living under different climates, equatorial and subtropical. The two populations were clearly distinguished not only by their wing size (the populations from the colder climate being bigger in size), but also by the shape of the response curves to growth temperature i.e., their reaction norms. In this respect, the temperature at which the size of the wing was maximum was about 3$^{\circ}$C higher in the equatorial population. Such a difference in size plasticity is already found in two other nonclosely related species, might be a general evolutionary pattern in drosophilids. Wing shape was investigated by calculating an ellipse included into the wing blade, then by considering the ratio of the two axes, and also by analysing the angular position of 10 wing-vein landmarks. For an overall shape index (ratio of the two axes of the ellipse), a regular and almost linear increase was observed with increasing temperature i.e., a more round shape at high temperatures. Wing shape was also analysed by considering the variations of the various angles according to temperature. A diversity of response curves was observed, revealing either a monotonous increase or decrease with increasing temperature, and sometimes a bell shape curve. An interesting conclusion is that, in most cases, a significant difference was observed between the two populations, and the difference was more pronounced at low temperatures. These angular variations are difficult to interpret in an evolutionary context. More comparative studies should be undertaken before reaching some general conclusions.</p>

				<title>Expression and identification of folate-sensitive fragile sites in British Suffolk sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0219-0227</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An investigation to understand the dynamics and biological significance of fragile site expression, and identification of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) induced chromosomal gaps/breaks, were carried out in an experimental flock of 45 Suffolk sheep. The statistical comparison revealed, highly significant variation in the frequency of chromosomal fragile site expression between control and FUdR cultures. Mean ($\pm$ S.D.) values for cells with gaps and breaks, or aberrant cell count (AC), and the number of aberrations (NoA) per animal were 2.02 $\pm$ 0.34, 2.42 $\pm$ 0.48, 13.26 $\pm$ 0.85 and 21.87 $\pm$ 1.88 ($P \lt 0.01$) in control and FUdR cultures, respectively. The comparison of age revealed nonsignificant variation between control and FUdR cultures. The G-band analysis of fragile site data revealed gaps in 29 autosomal and two X-chromosomal bands in the control cultures, whereas FUdR treated cultures scored 78 unstable bands in autosomes of which 56 were significantly fragile. X-chromosomes expressed breaks and gaps in six G-negative bands and five of them (Xq13, Xq15, Xq17, Xq24 and Xq26) were significantly fragile. The distribution comparison of autosomal fragile sites between sex groups did not reveal any significant variation. Female X-chromosomes were significantly more fragile than the male X-chromosomes. The distribution comparison for age groups (lambs versus adults) revealed significantly higher number of fragile bands in adults. Comparison of published data on reciprocal translocations in sheep with the fragile-site data obtained in this study indicated that the break sites of both phenomena were correlated. Similarities were also found between fragile sites and breakpoints of evolutionary significance in family Bovidae.</p>

				<title>$\alpha$-Thalassaemia in Tunisia: some epidemiological and molecular data</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0229-0234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Unlike the other haemoglobinopathies, few researches have been published concerning $\alpha$-thalassaemia in Tunisia. The aim of the present work is to acquire further data concerning $\alpha$-thalassaemia prevalence and molecular defects spectrum in Tunisia, by collecting and studying several kinds of samples carrying $\alpha$-thalassaemia. The first survey conducted on 529 cord blood samples using cellulose acetate electrophoresis, have displayed the prevalence of 7.38\%\ Hb Bart’s carriers at birth. Molecular analyses were conducted by PCR and DNA sequencing on 20 families’ cases from the above survey carrying the Hb Bart’s at birth and on 10 Hb H diseased patients. The results showed six $\alpha$-globin gene molecular defects and were responsible for $\alpha$-thalassaemia: -$\alpha^{3.7}$, - -$^{\text{MedI}}$, $\alpha^{\text{TSaudi}}$, $\alpha^{\text{cd23GAG}\to\text{Stop}}_{2}$, Hb Greone Hart: $\alpha^{\text{119CCT}\to\text{TCT}}_{1}$ corresponding to 11 genotypes out of which two are responsible for Hb H disease (--$^{\text{Med}}$/$-\alpha^{3.7}$) and ($\alpha^{\text{TSaudi}}\alpha/\alpha^{\text{TSaudi}}\alpha)$ and a newly described polymorphism: $\alpha^{+6\text{C}\to\text{G}}$. The geographical repartition of $\alpha$-thal carriers showed that the $-\alpha^{3.7}$ deletion is distributed all over the country, respectively the $\alpha^{\text{HphI}}$ and $\alpha^{\text{TSaudi}}$ seem to be more frequent in the central region of the northeast region. The haematological and clinical data showed a moderate phenotype with a late age of diagnosis for Hb H disease. This work had permitted, in addition to an overview on $\alpha$-thalassaemia in the country, the optimization of protocols for $\alpha$-thalassaemia detection in our lab, allowing further investigations concerning phenotype–genotype correlation in sickle cell disease or $\beta$-thalassaemia.</p>

				<title>Cold-induced alteration in the global structure of the male sex chromosome of <i>In(1)B</i>$^{M2}$<i>(reinverted)</i> of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is associated with increased acetylation of histone 4 at lysine 16</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0235-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, dosage compensation occurs through hypertranscription of sex-linked genes in males. The hypertranscription involves acetylation of histone 4 at lysine 16 (H4K16) on amale X-chromosome, brought about by a histone acetyltransferase encoded by the dosage compensation gene, <i>males absent on the first (mof)</i>. We report a phenomenon in the strain <i>In(1)B</i>$^{M2}$(<i>reinverted</i>) of <i>D. melanogaster</i> where the global structure of the male X-chromosome can be altered at the third instar larval stage through a 4-h cold shock at 12$\pm$1$^{\circ}$C. We show that the cold shock results in a transient hyperacetylation of H4K16 and an increased expression of <i>MOF</i>. Control proteins H4 acetylated at lysine 5, and the dosage compensation gene <i>msl-2</i>, do not show any change in expression after cold shock. Cytology of the male X-chromosome at different time points during cold shock and recovery, suggests that the hyperacetylation of H4 at lysine 16 causes the X-chromosome to corkscrew into itself, thereby achieving the cold-induced change in the higher order structure of the male polytene X-chromosome. Our studies suggest a role for H4K16 in maintaining the structure of the male X-chromosome in <i>Drosophila.</i></p>

				<title>Morphological and microsatellite diversity associated with ecological factors in natural populations of <i>Medicago laciniata</i> Mill. (Fabaceae)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0241-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic variability in 10 natural Tunisian populations of <i>Medicago laciniata</i> were analysed using 19 quantitative traits and 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci. A large degree of genetic variability within-populations and among-populations was detected for both quantitative characters and molecular markers. High genetic differentiation among populations for quantitative traits was seen, with $Q_{ST} = 0.47$, and $F_{ST} = 0.47$ for microsatellite markers. Several quantitative traits displayed no statistical difference in the levels of $Q_{ST}$ and $F_{ST}$. Further, significant correlations between quantitative traits and eco-geographical factors suggest that divergence in the traits among populations may track environmental differences. There was no significant correlation between genetic variability at quantitative traits and microsatellite markers within populations. The site-of-origin of eco-geographical factors explain between 18.13\%\ and 23.40\%\ of genetic variance among populations at quantitative traits and microsatellite markers, respectively. The environmental factors that most influence variation in measured traits among populations are assimilated phosphorus (P$_{2}$0$_{5}$) and mean annual rainfall, followed by climate and soil texture, altitude and organic matter. Significant associations between eco-geographical factors and gene diversity, $H_{e}$, were established in five-microsatellite loci suggesting that these simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are not necessarily biologically neutral.</p>

				<title>Where is Darwin 200 years later?</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0321-0325</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The theory of evolution is perceived by many people, particularly but not only in the United States, as a controversial theory not yet fully demonstrated. Yet, that living organisms, including humans, have evolved from ancestors who were very different from them is beyond reasonable doubt, confirmed by at least as much evidence as any other widely accepted scientific theory. I argue that Darwin’s contribution to science goes much beyond the theory of evolution in itself. The theory of natural selection explains the adaptations of organisms, their ‘design’. The ‘Copernican Revolution’ brought the phenomena of the physical universe into the realm of science: explanations by natural causes that can be tested by observation and experiment. However, the scientific revolution that occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries had left the living world out of scientific explanations, because organisms seemingly show that they are ‘designed,’ and thus call for an intentional designer. It was Darwin’s greatest contribution to science, to demonstrate that the adaptations of organisms, their apparent ‘design’, can be explained by natural processes governed by natural laws. At that point, science came into maturity, because all natural phenomena in the universe, living as well as nonliving, could be investigated scientifically, and explained as matter in motion governed by natural laws.</p>

				<title>The molecular basis of speciation: from patterns to processes, rules to mechanisms</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0327-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The empirical study of speciation has brought us closer to unlocking the origins of life’s vast diversity. By examining recently formed species, a number of general patterns, or rules, become apparent. Among fixed differences between species, sexual genes and traits are one of the most rapidly evolving and novel functional classes, and premating isolation often develops earlier than postmating isolation. Among interspecific hybrids, sterility evolves faster than inviability, the X-chromosome has a greater effect on incompatibilities than autosomes, and hybrid dysfunction affects the heterogametic sex more frequently than the homogametic sex (Haldane’s rule). Haldane’s rule, in particular, has played a major role in reviving interest in the genetics of speciation. However, the large genetic and reproductive differences between taxa and the multi-factorial nature of each rule have made it difficult to ascribe general mechanisms. Here, we review the extensive progress made since Darwin on understanding the origin of species. We revisit the rules of speciation, regarding them as landmarks as species evolve through time. We contrast these ‘rules’ of speciation to ‘mechanisms’ of speciation representing primary causal factors ranging across various levels of organization—from genic to chromosomal to organismal. To explain the rules, we propose a new ‘hierarchical faster-sex’ theory: the rapid evolution of sex and reproduction-related (SRR) genes (faster-SRR evolution), in combination with the preferential involvement of the X-chromosome (hemizygous X-effects) and sexually selected male traits (faster-male evolution). This unified theory explains a comprehensive set of speciation rules at both the prezyotic and postzygotic levels and also serves as a cohesive alternative to dominance, composite, and recent genomic conflict interpretations of Haldane’s rule.</p>

				<title>Defining fitness in evolutionary models</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0339-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The analysis of evolutionary models requires an appropriate definition for fitness. In this paper, I review such definitions in relation to the five major dimensions by which models may be described, namely</p>
					<ol type="roman">
						<li>finite versus infinite (or very large) population size,</li>
						<li>type of environment (constant, fixed length, temporally stochastic, temporally predictable, spatially stochastic, spatially predictable and social environment),</li>
						<li>density-independent or density-dependent,</li>
						<li>inherent population dynamics (equilibrium, cyclical and chaotic), and</li>
						<li>frequency-dependent or independent.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>In simple models, the Malthusian parameter ‘$r$’ or the net reproductive rate $R_0$ may be satisfactory, but once density-dependence or complex population dynamics is introduced the invasion exponent should be used. Defining fitness in a social environment or when there is frequency-dependence requires special consideration.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Although molecular methods, such as QTL mapping, have revealed a number of loci with large effects, it is still likely that the bulk of quantitative variability is due to multiple factors, each with small effect. Typically, these have a large additive component. Conventional wisdom argues that selection, natural or artificial, uses up additive variance and thus depletes its supply. Over time, the variance should be reduced, and at equilibrium be near zero. This is especially expected for fitness and traits highly correlated with it. Yet, populations typically have a great deal of additive variance, and do not seem to run out of genetic variability even after many generations of directional selection. Long-term selection experiments show that populations continue to retain seemingly undiminished additive variance despite large changes in the mean value. I propose that there are several reasons for this.</p>
					<ol type="roman">
						<li>The environment is continually changing so that what was formerly most fit no longer is.</li>
						<li>There is an input of genetic variance from mutation, and sometimes from migration.</li>
						<li>As intermediate-frequency alleles increase in frequency towards one, producing less variance (as $p \to 1$, $p(1 - p) \to 0$), others that were originally near zero become more common and increase the variance. Thus, a roughly constant variance is maintained.</li>
						<li>There is always selection for fitness and for characters closely related to it.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>To the extent that the trait is heritable, later generations inherit a disproportionate number of genes acting additively on the trait, thus increasing genetic variance. For these reasons a selected population retains its ability to evolve. Of course, genes with large effect are also important. Conspicuous examples are the small number of loci that changed teosinte to maize, and major phylogenetic changes in the animal kingdom. The relative importance of these along with duplications, chromosome rearrangements, horizontal transmission and polyploidy is yet to be determined. It is likely that only a case-by-case analysis will provide the answers. Despite the difficulties that complex interactions cause for evolution in Mendelian populations, such populations nevertheless evolve very well. Long-lasting species must have evolved mechanisms for coping with such problems. Since such difficulties do not arise in asexual populations, a comparison of epistatic patterns in closely related sexual and asexual species might provide some important insights.</p>

				<title>Genotype–environment interaction for total fitness in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0355-0362</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A fundamental assumption of models for the maintenance of genetic variation by environmental heterogeneity is that selection favours different genotypes in different environments. Here, I use a method for measuring total fitness of chromosomal heterozygotes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to assess genotype–environment interaction for fitness across two ecologically relevant environments, medium with and without added ethanol. Two-third chromosomes are compared, one from a population selected for ethanol tolerance, and the other from a control population. The results show strong crossing of reaction norms for outbred, total fitness, with the chromosome from the ethanol-adapted population increasing fitness on ethanol-supplemented food, but decreasing fitness on regular food, relative to the chromosome from the control population. Although I did not map the fitness effects below the chromosome level, the method could be adapted for quantitative trait locus mapping, to determine whether a substantial proportion of fitness variation is contributed by loci at which different alleles are favoured in different environments.</p>

				<title>Evolution of ageing since Darwin</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0363-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the late 19th century, the evolutionary approach to the problem of ageing was initiated by August Weismann, who argued that natural selection was more important for ageing than any physiological mechanism. In the mid-twentieth century, J. B. S. Haldane, P. B. Medawar and G. C. Williams informally argued that the force of natural selection falls with adult age. In 1966, W. D. Hamilton published formal equations that showed mathematically that two ‘forces of natural selection’ do indeed decline with age, though his analysis was not genetically explicit. Brian Charlesworth then developed the required mathematical population genetics for the evolution of ageing in the 1970’s. In the 1980’s, experiments using <i>Drosophila</i> showed that the rate of ageing evolves as predicted by Hamilton’s ‘forces of natural selection’. The discovery of the cessation of ageing late in life in the 1990’s was followed by its explanation in terms of evolutionary theory based on Hamilton’s forces. Recently, it has been shown that the cessation of ageing can also be manipulated experimentally using Hamilton’s ‘forces of natural selection’. Despite the success of evolutionary research on ageing, mainstream gerontological research has largely ignored both this work and the opportunity that it provides for effective intervention in ageing.</p>

				<title>Quantitative morphometrical analysis of a North African population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: sexual dimorphism, and comparison with European populations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0373-0382</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic variability of quantitative traits was investigated in aMoroccan population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, with an isofemale line design. Results were compared with data previously obtained from French populations. Although the environmental and thermal conditions are very different in France and Morocco, only two significant differences were observed: a shorter wing and a lighter abdomen pigmentation in Morocco. It is, therefore, concluded that Moroccan <i>D. melanogaster</i> are quite typical temperate flies, belonging to the Palaearctic region, and very different from the ancestral Afrotropical populations. Almost all traits were genetically variable, as shown by significant intraclass correlations among lines. Genetic correlations were highly significant among three size-related traits, while much lower between size and bristle numbers. Fluctuating asymmetry was greater for abdominal bristles than for sternopleural bristles. Sex dimorphism, analysed as a female/male ratio, was identical in French and Moroccan populations. Examination of the thorax length/thorax width ratio showed that the thorax is more elongated in females. Sexual dimorphism of wing length was significantly more correlated to thorax width than to thorax length. The results illustrate the value of measuring numerous quantitative traits on the same flies for characterizing the genetic architecture of a natural population. In several cases, and especially for genetic correlations, some interesting suggestions could be made, which should be confirmed, or invalidated, by more extensive investigations.</p>

				<title>Sexual conflict and environmental change: trade-offs within and between the sexes during the evolution of desiccation resistance</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0383-0394</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Intralocus sexual conflict occurs when males and females experience sex-specific selection on a shared genome. With several notable exceptions, intralocus sexual conflict has been investigated in constant environments to which the study organisms have had an opportunity to adapt. However, a change in the environment can result in differential or even opposing selection pressures on males and females, creating sexual conflict. We used experimental evolution to explore the interaction between intralocus sexual conflict, sexual dimorphism and environmental variation in Drosophila melanogaster. Six populations were selected for adult desiccation resistance (D), with six matched control populations maintained in parallel (C). After 46 generations, the D populations had increased in survival time under arid conditions by 68\%\ and in body weight by 20\%\ compared to the C populations. The increase in size was the result of both extended development and faster growth rate of D juveniles. Adaptation to the stress came at a cost in terms of preadult viability and female fecundity. Because males are innately less tolerant of desiccation stress, very few D males survived desiccation-selection; while potentially a windfall for survivors, these conditions mean that most males’ fitness was determined posthumously. We conjectured that selection for early maturation and mating in males was in conflict with selection for survival and later reproduction in females. Consistent with this prediction, the sexes showed different patterns of age-specific desiccation resistance and resource acquisition, and there was a trend towards increasingly female-biased sexual size dimorphism. However, levels of desiccation resistance were unaffected, with D males and females increasing in parallel. Either there is a strong positive genetic correlation between the sexes that limits independent evolution of desiccation resistance, or fitness pay-offs from the strategy of riding out the stress bout are great enough to sustain concordant selection on the two sexes. We discuss the forces that mould fitness in males under a regimen where trade-offs between survival and reproduction may be considerable.</p>

				<title>Potential constraints on evolution: sexual dimorphism and the problem of protandry in the butterfly <i>Bicyclus anynana</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0395-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The earlier mean adult emergence between males and females, protandry, has been well studied mathematically and in comparative studies. However, quantitative and evolutionary genetic research on protandry is scarce. The butterfly, <i>Bicyclus anynana</i> exhibits protandry and here we selected for each of the different combinations of male and female development time in this species, thus including direct selection on protandry (i.e., FAST, fast males and fast females; SLOW, slow males and slow females; FMSF, fast males and slow females; and SMFF, slow males and fast females). After eight generations of selection there was no significant response for increased or decreased protandry, whereas selection for increased or decreased development time in both sexes (FAST or SLOW) was successful. Continued selection ($\gt$ 30 generations) for decreased or increased protandry showed a significant difference between the FMSF$_{\text{C}}$ and SMFF$_{\text{C}}$ lines (subscript c for continued selection), which was of the same magnitude as the nonsignificant difference observed between the FMSF and SMFF lines at generation eight. This indicated that the initial selection was successful, but that the difference between the lines did not increase with continued selection. Our results also indicate that the genetic covariance across sexes for development time is near unity. Interestingly, lines selected for decreased protandry (SMFF) had lower egg-to-adult survival, and broods from these lines had lower rates of egg hatching. This suggests that interactions with fertility might constrain certain directions of change in patterns of protandry. Moreover, selection yielded a change in the ratio of male to female development time for slow lines, suggesting that some amount of sex-specific genetic variance for development time is still present in this population. The FMSF$_{\text{C}}$ line showed the largest effect of selection on protandry, mainly through an effect on female developmental time. Lastly, our results show that temperature has an effect on the amount of protandry in the selected lines. These results are discussed in relation to the ecology of this species and the evolution of protandry.</p>

				<title>Multidimensional analysis of <i>Drosophila</i> wing variation in Evolution Canyon</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0407-0419</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Environmental stress has been suggested to be a major evolutionary force, both through inducing strong selection and because of its direct impact on developmental buffering processes that alter the evolvability of organisms. In particular, temperature has attracted much attention because of its importance as an ecological feature and the relative ease with which it can be experimentally manipulated in the lab. Evolution Canyon, Lower Nahal Oren, Israel, is a well studied natural site where ecological parameters are suspected to drive evolutionary differentiation. In this study, using Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines derived from wild flies collected on both slopes of the canyon, we investigated the effect of developmental temperature upon the different components of phenotypic variation of a complex trait: the wing. Combining geometric and traditional morphometrics, we find only limited evidence for a differentiation among slopes. Investigating simultaneously phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation among isofemale lines, variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, we could not identify a consistent effect of the stressful conditions encountered on the south facing slope. The prevailing structuring effect is that of the experimentally manipulated temperature which clearly influences wing mean size and shape. Variability, in contrast, is not consistently affected by temperature. Finally, we investigated the specific relationship between individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry. Using metric multi-dimensional scaling we show that the related patterns of wing shape variation are not identical, supporting the view that the underlying developmental processes are to a certain extent different.</p>

				<title>The simplest formal argument for fitness optimization</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0421-0433</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Formal Darwinism Project aims to provide a formal argument linking population genetics to fitness optimization, which of necessity includes defining fitness. This bridges the gulf between those biologists who assume that natural selection leads to something close to fitness optimization and those biologists who believe on theoretical grounds that there is no sense of fitness that can usefully be said to be optimized. The current paper’s main objective is to provide a careful mathematical introduction to the project, and it also reflects on the project’s scope and limitations. The central argument is the proof of close ties between the mathematics of motion, as embodied in the Price equation, and the mathematics of optimization, as represented by optimization programmes. To make these links, a general and abstract model linking genotype, phenotype and number of successful gametes is assumed. The project has begun with simple dynamic models and simple linking models, and its progress will involve more realistic versions of them. The versions given here are fully mathematically rigorous, but elementary enough to serve as an introduction.</p>

				<title>Energy-responsive timekeeping</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0447-0458</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An essential component of energy homeostasis lies in an organism’s ability to coordinate daily patterns in activity, feeding, energy utilization and energy storage across the daily 24-h cycle. Most tissues of the body contain the molecular clock machinery required for circadian oscillation and rhythmic gene expression. Under normal circumstances, behavioural and physiological rhythms are orchestrated and synchronized by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, considered to be the master circadian clock. However, metabolic processes are easily decoupled from the primarily light-driven SCN when food intake is desynchronized from normal diurnal patterns of activity. This dissociation from SCN based timing demonstrates that the circadian system is responsive to changes in energy supply and metabolic status. There has long been evidence for the existence of an anatomically distinct and autonomous food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) that can govern behavioural rhythms, when feeding becomes the dominant entraining stimulus. But now rapidly growing evidence suggests that core circadian clock genes are involved in reciprocal transcriptional feedback with genetic regulators of metabolism, and are directly responsive to cellular energy supply. This close interaction is likely to be critical for normal circadian regulation of metabolism, and may also underlie the disruption of proper metabolic rhythms observed in metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type-II diabetes.</p>

				<title>The electroretinogram as a method for studying circadian rhythms in the mammalian retina</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0459-0466</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Circadian clocks are thought to regulate retinal physiology in anticipation of the large variation in environmental irradiance associated with the earth’s rotation upon its axis. In this review we discuss some of the rhythmic events that occur in the mammalian retina, and their consequences for retinal physiology. We also review methods of tracing retinal rhythmicity <i>in vivo</i> and highlight the electroretinogram (ERG) as a useful technique in this field. Principally, we discuss how this technique can be used as a quick and noninvasive way of assessing physiological changes that occur in the retina over the course of the day. We highlight some important recent findings facilitated by this approach and discuss its strengths and limitations.</p>

				<title>Circadian and pharmacological regulation of casein kinase I in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0467-0471</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In mammals, the mechanism for the generation of circadian rhythms and entrainment by light–dark (LD) cycles resides in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and the principal signal that adjusts this biological clock with environmental timing is the light:dark cycle. Within the SCN, rhythms are generated by a complex of molecular feedback loops that regulate the transcription of clock genes, including <i>per</i> and <i>cry</i>. Posttranslational modification plays an essential role in the regulation of biological rhythms; in particular, clock gene phosphorylation by casein kinase I, both epsilon (CKI$\epsilon$) and delta (CKI$\delta$), regulates key molecular mechanisms in the circadian clock. In this paper, we report for the first time that CKI activity undergoes a significant circadian rhythm in the SCN (peaking at circadian time 12, the start of the subjective night), and its pharmacological inhibition alters photic entrainment of the clock, indicating that CKI may be a key element in this pathway.</p>

				<title>Is vertical migration in Antarctic krill (<i>Euphausia superba</i>) influenced by an underlying circadian rhythm?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0473-0483</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Antarctic krill (<i>Euphausia superba</i>) is a keystone species in the southern ocean ecosystem where it is the main consumer of phytoplankton and constitutes the main food item of many higher predators. Both food and predators are most abundant at the surface, thus krill hide in the depth of the ocean during the day and migrate to the upper layers at night, to feed at a time when the predatory risk is lowest. Although the functional significance of this diel vertical migration (DVM) is clear and its modulation by environmental factors has been described, the involvement of an endogenous circadian clock in this behaviour is as yet not fully resolved. We have analysed the circadian behaviour of <i>Euphausia superba</i> in a laboratory setting and here we present the first description of locomotor activity rhythms for this species. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the circadian clock plays a key role in DVM. They also suggest that the interplay between food availability, social cues and the light:dark cycle acts as the predominant <i>Zeitgeber</i> for DVM in this species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>As an experimental model system, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> has been seminal in shaping our understanding of the circadian clockwork. The wealth of genetic tools at our disposal over the past four decades has enabled discovery of the genetic and molecular bases of circadian rhythmicity. More recently, detailed investigation leading to the anatomical, neurochemical and electrophysiological characterization of the various neuronal subgroups that comprise the circadian machinery has revealed pathways through which these neurons come together to act as a neuronal circuit. Thus the <i>D. melanogaster</i> circadian pacemaker circuit presents a relatively simple and attractive model for the study of neuronal circuits and their functions.</p>

				<title>Egg-laying rhythm in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0495-0504</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extensive research has been carried out to understand how circadian clocks regulate various physiological processes in organisms. The discovery of clock genes and the molecular clockwork has helped researchers to understand the possible role of these genes in regulating various metabolic processes. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, many studies have shown that the basic architecture of circadian clocks is multi-oscillatory. In nature, different neuronal subgroups in the brain of <i>D. melanogaster</i> have been demonstrated to control different circadian behavioural rhythms or different aspects of the same circadian rhythm. Among the circadian phenomena that have been studied so far in <i>Drosophila</i>, the egg-laying rhythm is unique, and relatively less explored. Unlike most other circadian rhythms, the egg-laying rhythm is rhythmic under constant light conditions, and the endogenous or free-running period of the rhythm is greater than those of most other rhythms. Although the clock genes and neurons required for the persistence of adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms have been studied extensively, those underlying the circadian egg-laying rhythm still remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the circadian egg-laying rhythm in <i>D. melanogaster</i>, and the possible molecular and physiological mechanisms that control the rhythmic output of the egg-laying process.</p>

				<title>The role of microRNAs (miRNA) in circadian rhythmicity</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0505-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MicroRNA (miRNA) is a recently discovered new class of small RNA molecules that have a significant role in regulating gene and protein expression. These small RNAs ($\sim$22 nt) bind to $3'$ untranslated regions ($3'$UTRs) and induce degradation or repression of translation of their mRNA targets. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in various organisms and have been shown to play a significant role in development and normal cell functioning. Recently, a few studies have suggested that miRNAs may be an important regulators of circadian rhythmicity, providing a new dimension (posttranscriptional) of our understanding of biological clocks. Here, we describe the mechanisms of miRNA regulation, and recent studies attempting to identify clock miRNAs and their function in the circadian system.</p>

				<title>Phenotypic effects of genetic variability in human clock genes on circadian and sleep parameters</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0513-0519</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Circadian rhythms and sleep are two separate but intimately related processes. Circadian rhythms are generated through the precisely controlled, cyclic expression of a number of genes designated clock genes. Genetic variability in these genes has been associated with a number of phenotypic differences in circadian as well as sleep parameters, both in mouse models and in humans. Diurnal preferences as determined by the selfreported Horne–Östberg (HÖ) questionnaire, has been associated with polymorphisms in the human genes <i>CLOCK, PER1, PER2</i> and <i>PER3</i>. Circadian rhythm-related sleep disorders have also been associated with mutations and polymorphisms in clock genes, with the advanced type cosegrating in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with mutations in the genes <i>PER2</i> and <i>CSNK1D</i>, and the delayed type associating without discernible Mendelian inheritance with polymorphisms in <i>CLOCK</i> and <i>PER3</i>. Several mouse models of clock gene null alleles have been demonstrated to have affected sleep homeostasis. Recent findings have shown that the variable number tandem polymorphism in <i>PER3</i>, previously linked to diurnal preference, has profound effects on sleep homeostasis and cognitive performance following sleep loss, confirming the close association between the processes of circadian rhythms and sleep at the genetic level.</p>

				<title>Remarkable evolutionary conservation of SOX14 orthologues</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0015-0024</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>SOX proteins constitute a large family of diverse, well-conserved transcription factors present in vertebrates and invertebrates, and also implicated in control of many developmental processes. Our objectives have been to identify <i>Sox14</i> gene of goat (<i>Capra hircus</i>), cow (<i>Bos taurus</i>) and rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>), and to perform comparative analyses and mapping of SOX14 orthologues from numerous vertebrate species. PCR based approach was used to identify <i>Sox14</i> of goat, cow and rat, while nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments and mapping were performed using information currently available in public database. Comparative sequence analysis revealed remarkable identity among <i>Sox14</i> orthologues and helped us to identify highly conserved motifs that represent molecular signatures of SOX14 protein that might have structural or functional significance. Further, we determined chromosomal locations of numerous predicted group B <i>Sox</i> genes and their neighbouring genes using currently available genome database. In conclusion, our study has not only supported the proposed model of group B <i>Sox</i> genes evolution in chicken and mammals, but has also revealed that additional evolutionary events split <i>Sox</i> B genes into different chromosomes in some mammals. Mapping data presented in this study could help in refining the understanding of the evolution of group B <i>Sox</i> genes in vertebrates.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The mating system and seed variation of <i>Acacia</i> hybrid (<i>A. mangium</i> $\times$ <i>A. auriculiformis</i>) were studied using allozymes and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, respectively. Multi-locus outcrossing rate estimations indicated that the hybrid was predominantly outcrossed (mean$\pm$s.e. $t_{m} = 0.86\pm 0.01$). Seed variation was investigated using 35 polymorphic RAPD fragments. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed the highest genetic variation among seeds within a pod (66\%–70\%), followed by among pods within inflorescence (29\%–37\%), and the least variation among inflorescences within tree ($\lt 1\%$). In addition, two to four RAPD profiles could be detected among seeds within pod. Therefore, the results suggest that a maximum of four seeds per pod could be sampled for the establishment of a mapping population for further studies.</p>

				<page>0033-0039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>Neurospora crassa fmf-1</i> mutation exerts an unusual ‘perithecium-dominant’ developmental arrest; <i>fmf-1</i> $\times$ <i>fmf-1$^{+}$</i> cross becomes arrested in perithecial development regardless of whether the mutant participates in the cross as the male or female parent. We localized <i>fmf-1</i> to the LG IL genome segment between the centromere-proximal breakpoint of the chromosome segment duplication <i>Dp(IL)39311</i> and the centromere. By mapping crossovers with respect to RFLP markers in this region we further localized <i>fmf-1</i> to an approximately 34-kb-genome segment. Partial sequencing of this segment revealed a point mutation in the gene <i>NCU 09387.1</i>, a homologue of the <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe ste11$^{+}$</i> regulator of sexual development. The <i>fmf-1</i> mutation did not complement a <i>NCU 09387.1</i> deletion mutation, and transformation with wild-type <i>NCU 09387.1</i> complemented <i>fmf-1. S. pombe</i> Ste11 protein (Ste 11p) is a transcription factor required for sexual differentiation and for the expression of genes required for mating pheromone signalling in <i>matP</i> and <i>matM</i> cells. If FMF-1 also plays a corresponding role in mating pheromone signalling in <i>Neurospora</i>, then protoperithecia in an <i>fmf-1</i> $\times$ <i>fmf-1$^{+}$</i> cross would be unable to either send or receive sexual differentiation signals and thus become arrested in development.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Somatostatin and its receptors have a critical role in mammalian growth through their control pattern of secretion of growth hormone, but the evolutionary history of somatostatin and somatostatin receptors are ill defined. We used comparative whole genome analysis of <i>Danio rerio, Carassius auratus, Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus, Monodelphis domestica, Homo sapiens, Sus scrofa, Bos taurus, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis lupus familiaris, Ovis aries, Equus caballus, Pan troglodytes</i> and <i>Macaca mulatto</i> to identify somatostatin and somatostatin receptors in each species. To date, we have identified a minimum of two genes of somatostatin and five somatostatin receptor genes in mammalian species with variable forms. We established a clear evolutionary history of the somatostatin system and traced the origin of the somatostatin system to 395 million years ago (MYA), identifying critical steps in their evolution.</p>

					<p>Stratification in heterogeneous populations poses an enormous challenge in linkage disequilibrium (LD) based identification of causal loci using surrogate markers. In this study, we demonstrate the enormous potential of endogamous Indian populations for mapping mutations in candidate genes using minimal SNPs, mainly due to larger regions of LD. We show this by a case study of the <i>PPP2R2B</i> gene ($\sim$400 kb) that harbours a CAG repeat, expansion of which has been implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12). Using LD information derived from Indian Genome Variation database (IGVdb) on populations which share similar ethnic and linguistic backgrounds as the SCA12 study population, we could map the causal loci using a minimal set of three SNPs, without the generation of additional basal data from the ethnically matched population. We could also demonstrate transferability of tagSNPs from a related HapMap population for mapping the mutation.</p>

				<title>QTL identification of grain protein concentration and its genetic correlation with starch concentration and grain weight using two populations in maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0061-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein is one of the three main storage chemical components in maize grains, and is negatively correlated with starch concentration (SC). Our objective was to analyse the influence of genetic backgrounds on QTL detection for protein concentration (PC) and to reveal the molecular genetic associations between PC and both SC and grain weight (GWP). Two hundred and eighty-four (Pop1) and 265 (Pop2) F$_{2:3}$ families were developed from two crosses between one high-oil maize inbred GY220 and two normal maize inbreds 8984 and 8622 respectively, and were genotyped with 185 and 173 pairs of SSR markers. PC, SC and GWP were evaluated under two environments. Composite interval mapping (CIM) and multiple interval mapping (MIM) methods were used to detect single-trait QTL for PC, and multiple-trait QTL for PC with both SC and GWP. No common QTL were shared between the two populations for their four and one PC QTL. Common QTL with opposite signs of effects for PC and SC/GWP were detected on three marker intervals at bins 6.07–6.08, 8.03 and 8.03–8.04. Multiple-traits QTL mapping showed that tightly-linked QTL, pleiotropic QTL and QTL having effects with opposite directions for PC and SC/GWP were all observed in Pop1, while all QTL reflected opposite effects in Pop2.</p>

				<title>Cytogenetic study of <i>Ascaris</i> trypsin inhibitor in cultured human lymphocytes with metabolic activation</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0069-0075</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The trypsin inhibitor (ATI) isolated from gastrointestinal nematode <i>Ascaris suum</i> was tested <i>in vitro</i> for induction of chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE). Genotoxicity assessment of purified ATI was carried out on metaphase plates received from peripheral blood lymphocyte macroculture (48 h test of structural chromosome aberrations and 72 h test of SCE) with exogenous metabolic activation. ATI was tested in dose of 25, 50 and 100 μg per ml of culture. Kinetics of cell divisions were determined by the replication index (RI). The mitotic index (MI) was expressed as a number of metaphases per 1000 nuclei analysed. Analysis of chromosome aberrations showed that higher doses of ATI (50 and 100 $\mu$/ml) significantly increased the frequency of chromosome aberrations (mainly of chromatid gaps and breaks) compared to the negative control. All concentrations of ATI caused a statistically significant reduction in the MI and RI. In comparison with the negative control, a significant increase in the SCE frequency was observed in all applied doses of ATI. Thus, in the presence of S9 activation, the Ascaris trypsin inhibitor showed potential clastogenic activity and inhibition of the dynamics of lymphocyte divisions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Indian subcontinent harbours both the human mtDNA macrohaplogroups M and N, of which M is the most prevalent. In this study, we discuss the overall distribution of the various haplogroups and sub-haplogroups of M among the different castes and tribes to understand their diverse pattern with respect to geographical location and linguistic affiliation of the populations. An overview of about 170 studied populations, belonging to four distinct linguistic families and inhabiting different geographic zones, revealed wide diversity of about 22 major haplogroups of M. The tribal populations belonging to the same linguistic family but inhabiting different geographical regions (Dravidian and Austro–Asiatic speakers) exhibited differences in their haplogroup diversity. The northern and southern region castes showed greater diversity than the castes of other regions.</p>

				<title>Identification of <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> genes involved in asexual sporogenesis</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0141-0148</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in asexual spore development in <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>, the zoospores of strain PS26 were treated with ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. After selection, a mutant progeny, termed PS26-U03, was obtained and demonstrated to exhibit no oospore production. A suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) approach was developed to investigate differences in gene expression between PS26 and PS26-U03 during asexual sporogenesis. Of the 126 sequences chosen for examination, 39 putative unigenes were identified that exhibit high expression in PS26. These sequences are predicted to encode proteins involved in metabolism, cell cycle, protein biosynthesis, cell signalling, cell defence, and transcription regulation. Seven clones were selected for temporal expression analysis using RT-PCR based on the results of the dot-blot screens. Three of the selected genes, developmental protein DG1037 (<i>UB88</i>), glycoside hydrolase (<i>UB149</i>) and a hypothetical protein (<i>UB145</i>), were expressed only in PS26, whereas the transcripts of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (<i>UB36</i>), FAD-dependent pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase (<i>UB226</i>) and sugar transporter (<i>UB256</i>) were expressed at very low levels in PS26-U03 but at high levels in PS26.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Patients with <i>de novo</i> acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and near-tetraploid or completely tetraploid karyotype at presentation are rare. We present four patients with near-tetraploidy/tetraploidy in a cohort of 426 consecutive AML patients (0.98\%) in respect to their cytogenetic findings, immunophenotype pattern, response to chemotherapy, course of disease and molecular analyses including tyrosine kinase receptor <i>FLT3</i> gene, <i>NRAS</i> gene, and tumour suppressor gene, <i>p53</i>. We have found <i>FLT3/ITD</i> mutation only in one patient among the four with near-tetraploidy. The main finding is that these patients had a variable clinical course, with two having a long period of remission (36 and 12 months) and two died, not having achieved remission.</p>

				<title>Genetic characterization of <i>Perna viridis</i> L. in peninsular Malaysia using microsatellite markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0153-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A total of 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to analyse levels of genetic variation for 10 populations of <i>Perna viridis</i> L. collected from all over peninsular Malaysia. The populations involved in this study included Pulau Aman in Penang, Tanjung Rhu in Kedah, Bagan Tiang in Perak, Pulau Ketam in Selangor, Muar, Parit Jawa, Pantai Lido and Kampung Pasir Puteh in Johore, and Kuala Pontian and Nenasi in Pahang state. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to seven, with an average of 3.1. Heterozygote deficiencies were observed across all the 10 populations. Characterization of the populations revealed that local populations of <i>P. viridis</i> in peninsular Malaysia were genetically similar enough to be used as a biomonitoring agent for heavy metal contamination in the Straits of Malacca. Cluster analysis grouped the <i>P. viridis</i> populations according to their geographical distributions with the exception of Parit Jawa. The analysis also revealed that <i>P. viridis</i> from the northern parts of peninsular Malaysia were found to be the most distant populations among the populations of mussels investigated and <i>P. viridis</i> from the eastern part of peninsular Malaysia were closer to the central and southern populations than to the northern populations.</p>

				<title>Dwarf mutations in grass pea (<i>Lathyrus sativus</i> L.): origin, morphology, inheritance and linkage studies</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0165-0175</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Induction of mutation has been used to create additional genetic variability in grass pea (<i>Lathyrus sativus</i> L.). During the ongoing investigations on different induced-morphological mutants, the author detected three types of dwarf mutants in grass pea. One mutant, designated as <i>dwf1</i> type was earlier identified in colchicine-induced C$_{2}$ generation of grass pea variety BioR-231 while the other two, designated as <i>dwf2</i> and <i>dwf3</i> were isolated in 250 Gy and 300 Gy gamma ray irradiated M$_{2}$ progeny of variety ‘BioR-231’ and ‘Hooghly Local’, respectively. As compared to their parental varieties (controls), all the three mutants manifested stunted, erect and determinate stem, early maturity and tolerance to pod shattering habit. The mutants differed from each other, as well as with controls, in number of primary branches, nature of stipules and internodes, length of peduncle, leaflet and seed coat colour, seed yield and seed neurotoxin content. The three dwarf mutants were monogenically recessive and bred true in successive generations. F$_{2}$ segregation pattern obtained from the crosses involving the three mutants indicated that dwarf mutation in grass pea was controlled by two independent non-allelic genes, assigned as <i>df1</i> (for <i>dwf1</i> type), <i>df2</i> (for <i>dwf2</i> type) and <i>df3</i> (for <i>dwf3</i> type), with the <i>df1</i> locus being multiple allelic. Primary trisomic analyses revealed the presence of <i>df1/df2</i> locus on the extra chromosome of trisomic type I, whereas <i>df3</i> was located on the extra chromosome of type III. Linkage studies involving five other phenotypic markers suggested linked association of <i>df1/df2</i> locus with <i>lfc</i> (leaflet colour) and <i>wgn</i> (winged internode) and <i>df3</i> locus with <i>cbl</i> (seed coat colour). Both the loci; however, assorted independently with flower colour and stipule character. The dwarf types can be utilized as valuable tools for further cytogenetic research and breeding of grass pea.</p>

				<title>Cytogenetic characterization of <i>Eurysternus caribaeus</i> (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae): evidence of sex-autosome fusion and diploid number reduction prior to species dispersion</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0177-0182</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mitotic and meiotic chromosomes of several populations of <i>Eurysternus caribaeus</i> (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) were analysed through conventional staining, C-banding, base-specific fluorochromes, silver nitrate staining and fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH). All specimens showed $2n = 8$ in their karyotypes, with a neo-XY sex system (Y is a submetacentric and X a metacentric) and three pairs of submetacentric autosomes. The analysis of constitutive heterochromatin (CH) revealed small blocks located in the centromeric region of all chromosomes which do not present positive staining under the fluorochromes CMA$_{3}$ and DAPI. Silver nitrate staining revealed that the nucleolar organizer region (NORs) is associated with the sex chromosomes. The FISH technique revealed that rDNA sites in the X and Y are different in size. Data from different populations indicate that the diploid number reduction $(2n = 8)$ observed in <i>E. caribaeus</i> is established and presumably has preceded the dispersion of this species. Moreover, this reduction occasioned the translocation of rDNA sites to the sex chromosomes, X and Y, an uncommon pattern in Scarabaeidae that was observed for the first time by the FISH in this work.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0183-0189</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for chlorophyll content were studied using a doubled haploid (DH) population with 168 progeny lines, derived from a cross between two elite Chinese wheat cultivars Huapei 3 $\times$ Yumai 57. Chlorophyll content was evaluated at the maximum tillering stage (MS), the heading stage (HS), and the grain filling stage (GS), at three different environments in 2005 and 2006 cropping seasons. QTL analyses were performed using a mixed linear model approach. A total of 17 additive QTLs and nine pairs of epistatic QTLs were detected. Ten of 17 additive QTLs for chlorophyll content were persistently expressed at more than two growth stages, which suggest developmentally regulated loci controlling genetics for chlorophyll content in different growth stages in wheat. One novel major QTL for chlorophyll content was closely linked with the PCR marker <i>Xwmc215</i> and was persistently expressed at three growth stages.</p>

					<p>Multiple studies have shown that IL23 cytokine plays an essential role in the development of autoimmune diseases by activating IL17-producing helper T (Th17) cells. Given that the susceptibility loci in <i>IL23R</i> for Crohn’s disease (CD) is present in Western population and not in Asian population; we screened the <i>IL23R</i> gene by DNA sequencing to identify susceptibility loci in a selected CD cohort and confirmed it in all our subjects (134 CD and 131 controls). A novel nonsynonymous SNP (p.Gly149Arg, c.445G$\gt$A) and 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Among them, only <i>rs11465788</i> was implicated in CD susceptibility ($P = 4.9 \times 10^{-4}$, OR $= 0.30$). Genotype–phenotypic interaction analysis showed that <i>rs11465788</i> is associated with nonstricturing and nonpenetrating disease behaviour in CD patients ($P = 0.015$). Our results provide the evidence that <i>rs11465788</i> may influence the susceptibility and clinical features of CD in Chinese population.</p>

				<title>Analysis of genetic structure and relationship among nine indigenous Chinese chicken populations by the <i>Structure</i> program</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0197-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The multi-locus model-based clustering method <i>Structure</i> program was used to infer the genetic structure of nine indigenous Chinese chicken (<i>Gallus gallus</i>) populations based on 16 microsatellite markers. Twenty runs were carried out at each chosen value of predefined cluster numbers $(K)$ under admixture model. The <i>Structure</i> program properly inferred the presence of genetic structure with 0.999 probabilities. The genetic structure not only indicated that the nine kinds of chicken populations were defined actually by their locations, phenotypes or culture, but also reflected the underlying genetic variations. At $K = 2$, nine chicken populations were divided into two main clusters, one light-body type, including Chahua chicken (CHA), Tibet chicken (TIB), Xianju chicken (XIA), Gushi chicken (GUS) and Baier chicken (BAI); and the other heavy-body type, including Beijing You chicken (YOU), Xiaoshan chicken (XIA), Luyuan chicken (LUY) and Dagu chicken (DAG). GUS and DAG were divided into independent clusters respectively when $K$ equaled 4, 5, or 6. XIA and BIA chicken, XIA and LUY chicken, TIB and CHA chicken still clustered together when $K$ equaled 6, 7, and 8, respectively. These clustering results were consistent with the breeding directions of the nine chicken populations. The <i>Structure</i> program also identified migrants or admixed individuals. The admixed individuals were distributed in all the nine chicken populations, while migrants were only distributed in TIB, XIA and LUY populations. These results indicated that the clustering analysis using the <i>Structure</i> program might provide an accurate representation of the genetic relationship among the breeds.</p>

				<title>Upper petal lip colour polymorphism in <i>Collinsia heterophylla</i> (Plantaginaceae): genetic basis within a population and its use as a genetic marker</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0205-0215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Understanding the genetics of a polymorphic trait is important to predict its likely evolution. In <i>Collinsia heterophylla,</i> the upper petal lip colour can be either be white or white with a purple band, while the lower petal lip colour is invariably purple. Because the corolla is only partly polymorphic, the polymorphism can not have evolved due to a mutation where a pigment was lost in the entire plant, which is common in other polymorphic species. In a previous study, high frequency of the purple band was found in populations with darker flowers, indicating possible selection for this trait. In this study, I determined inheritance of the colour polymorphism using two populations (one with only white morph and other with both morphs). I conducted experimental crosses within and between floral morphs to determine whether patterns of segregation in offspring conform to single-gene predictions. Data from F$_{1}$, F$_{2}$, F$_{3}$ and backcross progeny are consistent with a genetic model of one major locus with presence of the band being completely dominant, as indicated in earlier studies using distantly related populations. A novel finding in this study was that the two morphs did not show a difference in seed germination frequency or seedling survival. This trait can thus be valuable as a genetic marker. Even though more thorough ecological data are needed to understand the potential selection pressures on upper petal lip colour in <i>C. heterophylla</i>, its simple inheritance may indicate the possibility of fast evolutionary response to selective forces acting on this trait.</p>

				<title>Mining of expressed sequence tag libraries of cacao for microsatellite markers using five computational tools</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0217-0225</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provide researchers with a quick and inexpensive route for discovering new genes, data on gene expression and regulation, and also provide genic markers that help in constructing genome maps. Cacao is an important perennial crop of humid tropics. Cacao EST sequences, as available in the public domain, were downloaded and made into contigs. Microsatellites were located in these ESTs and contigs using five softwares (MISA, TRA, TROLL, SSRIT and SSR primer). MISA gave maximum coverage of SSRs in cacao ESTs and contigs, although TRA was able to detect higher order ($\gt$5-mer) repeats. The frequency of SSRs was one per 26.9 kb in the known set of ESTs. One-third of the repeats in EST-contigs were found to be trimeric. A few rare repeats like 21-mer repeat were also located. A/T repeats were most abundant among the mononucleotide repeats and the AG/GA/TC/CT type was the most frequent among dimerics. Flanking primers were designed using Primer3 program and verified experimentally for PCR amplification. The results of the study are made available freely online database (http://riju.byethost31.com/cocoa/). Seven primer pairs amplified genomic DNA isolated from leaves were used to screen a representative set of 12 accessions of cacao.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>multifoliate pinna</i> (<i>mfp</i>) mutation alters the leaf-blade architecture of pea, such that simple tendril pinnae of distal domain are replaced by compound pinna blades of tendrilled leaflets in mfp homozygotes. The <i>MFP</i> locus was mapped with reference to DNA markers using F$_{2}$ and F$_{2:5}$ RIL as mapping populations. Among 205 RAPD, 27 ISSR and 35 SSR markers that demonstrated polymorphism between the parents of mapping populations, three RAPD markers were found linked to the <i>MFP</i> locus by bulk segregant analyses on <i>mfp/mfp</i> and <i>MFP/MFP</i> bulks assembled from the F$_{2:5}$ population. The segregational analysis of <i>mfp</i> and 267 DNA markers on 96 F$_{2}$ plants allowed placement of 26 DNA markers with reference to <i>MFP</i> on a linkage group. The existence of common markers on reference genetic maps and <i>MFP</i> linkage group developed here showed that <i>MFP</i> is located on linkage group IV of the consensus genetic map of pea.</p>

				<title>Detection of combined genomic variants in a Jordanian family with familial non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0233-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Five patients, four brothers and their paternal aunt, presented with a history of overt hyperthyroidism and goiter. Hyperthyroidism in this family was remarkable for its poor response to carbimazole (30–50 mg/d). The thyroid ultrasound showed a diffusely enlarged gland in all the affected members, and thyroid stimulating antibodies (TSAB) were negative. Screening for germline mutations in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (<i>TSHR</i>) gene was performed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of all family members. The sequence analysis of all <i>TSHR</i> gene exons and intron borders revealed two genomic variants. The first was a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within exon seven (Asn187Asn), whereas the other was located in intron seven (IVS7+68T$\gt$G). All affected members, two asymptomatic brothers with sub-clinical hyperthyroidism, and their father were heterozygous for those two genomic variants. Anti-thyroid drug treatment for several months successfully relieved symptoms in one subject, whereas the remaining patients required total thyroidectomy to control their disease. This is the first Jordanian family with familial non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism, with mutations affecting the <i>TSHR</i> gene.</p>

				<title>A case of Silver–Russell syndrome (SRS): multiple pituitary hormone deficiency, lack of H19 hypomethylation and favourable growth hormone (GH) treatment response</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0239-0243</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hypomethylation of the imprinting control region 1 (ICR1) at the <i>IGF2/H19</i> locus on 11p15 is linked to Silver–Russell syndrome (SRS) and/or hemihypertrophy. This SRS patient was born in term with weight of 3500 g (50 percentile) and length 48 cm ($\gt$1 SD below the mean). He was first noticed at the age of 10 years for short stature (114.5 cm, $-3.85$ SD), relatively normal head circumference, a classic facial phenotype, hemihypertrophy (2.5 cm thinner left arm and leg in comparison to the right, asymmetric face), moderate clinodactyly and striking thinness (BMI of 15.3). At the age of 30, the body asymmetry ameliorated (1 cm thinner left arm and leg than the right), and BMI normalized (20.5 cm). Methylation analysis was performed by bisulphate treatment of DNA samples, radiolabelled PCR amplification, and digestion of the PCR products using restriction enzymes. The patient had normomethylation, and in addition hypopituitarism, with low levels of growth hormone (GH) (provocative testing before the start and after termination of GH treatment), thyroxin, TSH, FSH, LH and testosterone. The GH was given for six years, growth response was satisfactory and he reached an adult height of 166 cm. This is a first report of hypopituitarism in a patient with SRS without H19 hypomethylation. It seems that the lack of hypomethylation in this hypopituitary SRS patient is responsible, at least partly, for the favourable final adult height under GH treatment.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Genetically caused deafness is a common trait affecting one in 1000 children and is predominantly inherited in an autosomal-recessive fashion. Several mutations in the <i>GJB2</i> gene and a deletion of 342 kb in <i>GJB6</i> gene (del<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830) have been identified worldwide in patients with hearing impairment. In the present study, 303 nonsyndromic hearing-impaired patients (140 familial; 163 sporadic) were examined clinically and screened for mutations in <i>GJB2</i> and <i>GJB6</i> genes. Mutations in <i>GJB2</i> gene were found in 33 (10.9\%) patients of whom six (18.2\%) were carriers for the mutant allele. The most frequent mutation was p.W24X accounting for 87\%\ of the mutant alleles. In addition, six other sequence variations were identified in the <i>GJB2</i> gene viz., c.IVS1+1G$\gt$A, c.167delT, c.235delC, p.W77X, p.R127H (polymorphism), p.M163V. None of the samples showed del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830) or any point mutations in <i>GJB6</i> gene.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of RAPD-PCR and protein profile analysis to differentiate <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> strains prevalent along the southwest coast of India</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0273-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sixty five isolates of <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> were subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis and protein profiling to investigate the genetic variability among <i>V. harveyi</i> prevalent along the coast and also assess the discriminating ability of these two molecular methods. A total of 10 RAPD primers were assayed for their specificity in detecting <i>V. harveyi</i>, of which only two primers: PM3 and CRA25 were highly reproducible and found suitable for use in RAPD-PCR. The genetic diversity among <i>V. harveyi</i> isolates assessed by RAPD-PCR using PM3 primer yielded 35 different RAPD patterns which clustered the isolates into 15 groups at 72\%\ similarity level. Similarly, RAPD-PCR with CRA25 clustered the 38 patterns into 10 groups at 74\%\ similarity. The discriminatory index $(D)$ value calculated for RAPD fingerprints generated with PM3 and CRA25 were 0.90 and 0.85, respectively. On the other hand, molecular typing of <i>V. harveyi</i> using whole cell proteins generated profiles that showed no major difference indicating the technique to be not useful in typing strains of this bacterium. However, a few of the isolates showed the presence of unique band of 28 kDa that needs to be further investigated to understand the role of the protein in disease process if any.</p>

				<title>Genetic variability and relationship between MT-1 elephant grass and closely related cultivars assessed by SRAP markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0281-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic variability and relationships among elephant grass cultivars were estimated by the SRAP (sequence-related amplified polymorphism) assay. A total of 60 individuals collected from five cultivars in China were analysed. Sixty-two selected primer combinations generated 1395 bands, with an average of 22.5 per primer combination. The average value of percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was 72.8\%\ at species level. The PPB was from 15.2\%\ to 75\%, with an average of 39.6\%\ at cultivar level. $H_{POP}$, within-cultivar Shannon’s index was 1.738 at cultivar level; at species level, the Shannon’s index $(H_{SP})$ was 3.880. An assessment of diversity between cultivars $[(H_{SP} −H_{POP})/H_{SP}]$ indicated that most of the diversity (55.2\%) was detected among cultivars, and only 44.8\%\ was within cultivars in total genetic variation. According to UPGMA dendrogram, the five cultivars were clustered into three main groups. One group included MT-1 and Mott with a bootstrap support of 100\%, another consisted of Huanan and N51 with a bootstrap support of 81\%, and last one was only Guimu-1. The results indicate that the MT-1 and Mott have a closest genetic relationship; Huanan and N51 possess a relatively close relationship, and Guimu-1 is the most distinct from the other four cultivars.</p>

				<title>Genotype–phenotype relationship of <i>F7</i> R353Q polymorphism and plasma factor VII coagulant activity in Asian Indian families predisposed to coronary artery disease</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0291-0297</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Elevated factor VII (FVII) level is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated the role of R353Q polymorphism in the <i>F7</i> gene in 139 Indian families with CAD, comprising of 222 affected subjects, 105 unaffected subjects and 126 affected sibling pairs. Plasma per cent FVIIc activity (FVII.c activity) differed significantly across R353Q genotype ($P \lt 0.0001$). Frequency of subjects with RR and QQ genotypes were higher in 4th quartile and 1st quartile of FVII.c activity, respectively ($P \lt 0.0001$). <i>F7</i> R353Q SNP was able to explain up to 7\%\ of variation in FVII.c activity by regression analysis and an additive genetic component of variance of 28.04\%\ by heritability analysis. Quantitative trait loci analysis showed suggestive linkage evidence of <i>F7</i> SNP with per cent FVII.c activity (LOD score $-1.82$; $P = 0.002$). Individuals with RR and RQ genotypes carried an OR of 2.071 (95\%\ c.i. = 1.506–2.850) and 2.472 (95\%\ c.i. = 1.679–3.641), respectively, towards CAD risk. There was significant correlation of FVII.c activity with lipid markers, particularly among those with RR and RQ genotype after covariate adjustment. In conclusion, the <i>F7</i> R353Q SNP appears to moderately influence plasma FVII.c activity and risk of CAD in Indians.</p>

				<title>A complete mitochondrial genome of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> cv. Chinese Yumai), and fast evolving mitochondrial genes in higher plants</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0299-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Plant mitochondrial genomes, encoding necessary proteins involved in the system of energy production, play an important role in the development and reproduction of the plant. They occupy a specific evolutionary pattern relative to their nuclear counterparts. Here, we determined the winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> cv. Chinese Yumai) mitochondrial genome in a length of 452 and 526 bp by shotgun sequencing its BAC library. It contains 202 genes, including 35 known protein-coding genes, three rRNA and 17 tRNA genes, as well as 149 open reading frames (ORFs; greater than 300 bp in length). The sequence is almost identical to the previously reported sequence of the spring wheat (<i>T. aestivum</i> cv. Chinese Spring); we only identified seven SNPs (three transitions and four transversions) and 10 indels (insertions and deletions) between the two independently acquired sequences, and all variations were found in non-coding regions. This result confirmed the accuracy of the previously reported mitochondrial sequence of the Chinese Spring wheat. The nucleotide frequency and codon usage of wheat are common among the lineage of higher plant with a high AT-content of 58\%. Molecular evolutionary analysis demonstrated that plant mitochondrial genomes evolved at different rates, which may correlate with substantial variations in metabolic rate and generation time among plant lineages. In addition, through the estimation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates between orthologous mitochondrion-encoded genes of higher plants, we found an accelerated evolutionary rate that seems to be the result of relaxed selection.</p>

				<title>PCR-based clonality assessment in patients with lymphocytic leukaemias: a single-institution experience</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0309-0314</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>PCR-based clonality testing can be performed in all lymphoproliferations by analysing gene rearrangements of antigen receptors, rearrangements that are unique for each kind of lymphocyte. Reactive lymphoproliferations have polyclonally rearranged Ig/TCR genes, whereas malignant proliferations (leukaemias and lymphomas) show clonal rearrangements. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical benefits of clonality testing with previously evaluated consensus primers in leukaemia patients. The study included peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 67 leukaemia patients (32 B-CLL, 24 B-ALL and 11 T-ALL). Clonality testing was based on PCR amplification of rearranged I$_{\text{gH}}$ and TCR genes. During diagnosis, monoclonal pattern was found in all analysed B-CLL and T-ALL samples. Testing in B-ALL patients showed positive results in all bone marrow and one peripheral blood samples. Results of clonality testing in B-CLL patients during follow-up were concordant between peripheral blood and bone marrow. Obtained results corresponded to clinical course in all but one patient. In B-ALL group, results of molecular testing in peripheral blood and bone marrow confirmed remission estimated according to clinical criteria in all except one patient. Before any clinical sign of relapse, monoclonal pattern was found in six/seven patients by bone marrow and in three/seven patients by peripheral blood analysis, respectively. Results of molecular monitoring in T-ALL patients did not confirme clinical evaluation in two patients. Obtained results indicate high accuracy of re-evaluated primers for clonality assessment in ALL and CLL patients at the time of diagnosis. Results of clonality testing in B-ALL patients indicate that bone marrow analysis has higher sensitivity compared to analysis of peripheral blood.</p>

				<title>Population distribution of 45S and 5S rDNA in golden mahseer, <i>Tor putitora</i>: population-specific FISH marker</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0315-0320</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chromosomal locations of major 45S and minor 5S ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs) and organization of 5S rRNA genes were analysed in five different populations of golden mahseers (<i>Tor putitora</i>) using fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot hybridization. All five populations of <i>T. putitora</i> ($2n = 100$) showed a similar type of macro-karyotype composed of 12 metacentric, 22 submetacentric, 14 subtelocentric and 52 telocentric chromosomes. Analysis of active nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) by silver staining did not show any differences in number and chromosomal position in different populations. But FISH data showed significant difference between the populations, four of the five populations showed six 18S (three pairs) and two 5S (one pair) signals with positional polymorphism, while one population showed eight 18S and four 5S signals, respectively. Southern blot data confirms that 5S rDNA clusters present on two different chromosome pairs in Kosi river population contain non-transcribed spacers (NTS) of same length. In the present study, simultaneous localization of 45S and 5S rDNA by in <i>situ</i> hybridization helped us to develop the discrete population-specific markers in different geographically isolated populations of <i>T. putitora.</i></p>

				<title>Mutators and hypermutability in bacteria: the <i>Escherichia coli</i> paradigm</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0379-0391</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mutators (also called hypermutators) are mutants which show higher than normal spontaneous mutation frequencies, ranging from 10–20 fold to 100–1000 fold higher, or sometimes even more, than wild-type cells. Being a mutator is advantageous to the organism when adapting to environmental changes or stressful situations, such as moving from one habitat to another, one host to another, exposure to antibiotics etc. However, this advantage is only a short-term benefit. In the long run, hypermutability leads to a fitness disadvantage due to accumulation of deleterious mutations or antagonistic pleiotropy or both. Contrary to intuitive expectations, hypermutability is commonly encountered in natural bacterial populations, especially among clinical isolates. It is believed to be involved in the emergence of antibiotic resistance and a hindrance to the treatment of infectious diseases. Here, I review the state of knowledge on the common mechanisms of hypermutability such as errors/defects in DNA replication, proof reading, mismatch repair, oxidative DNA damage, mistranslation etc., as well as phenomena associated with these processes, using Escherichia coli as a paradigmatic organism.</p>

				<title>RPGR-containing protein complexes in syndromic and non-syndromic retinal degeneration due to ciliary dysfunction</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0399-0407</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dysfunction of primary cilia due to mutations in cilia-centrosomal proteins is associated with pleiotropic disorders. The primary (or sensory) cilium of photoreceptors mediates polarized trafficking of proteins for efficient phototransduction. Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) is a cilia-centrosomal protein mutated in >70% of X-linked RP cases and 10\%–20\%\ of simplex RP males. Accumulating evidence indicates that RPGR may facilitate the orchestration of multiple ciliary protein complexes. Disruption of these complexes due to mutations in component proteins is an underlying cause of associated photoreceptor degeneration. Here, we highlight the recent developments in understanding the mechanism of cilia-dependent photoreceptor degeneration due to mutations in RPGR and RPGR-interacting proteins in severe genetic diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), Joubert syndrome, and Senior–Loken syndrome, and explore the physiological relevance of photoreceptor ciliary protein complexes.</p>

				<title>Channelrhodopsins provide a breakthrough insight into strategies for curing blindness</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0409-0415</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photoreceptor cells are the only retinal neurons that can absorb photons. Their degeneration due to some diseases or injuries leads to blindness. Retinal prostheses electrically stimulating surviving retinal cells and evoking a pseudo light sensation have been investigated over the past decade for restoring vision. Currently, a gene therapy approach is under development. Channelrhodopsin-2 derived from the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, is a microbial-type rhodopsin. Its specific characteristic is that it functions as a light-driven cation-selective channel. It has been reported that the channelrhodopsin-2 transforms inner light-insensitive retinal neurons to light-sensitive neurons. Herein, we introduce new strategies for restoring vision by using channelrhodopsins and discuss the properties of adeno-associated virus vectors widely used in gene therapy.</p>

				<title>Induced pluripotent stem cells for retinal degenerative diseases: a new perspective on the challenges</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0417-0424</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Retinal degenerative diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, are the prodominant causes of human blindness in the world; however, these diseases are difficult to treat. Currently, knowledge on the mechanisms of these diseases is still very limited and no radical drugs are available. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are an innovative technology that turns somatic cells into embryonic stem (ES)-like cells with pluripotent potential via the exogenous expression of several key genes. It can be used as an unlimited source for cell differentiation or tissue engineering, either of which is a promising therapy for human degenerative diseases. Induced pluripotent cells are both an unlimited source for retinal regeneration and an expectant tool for pharmaprojects and developmental or disease modelling. In this review, we try to summarize the advancement of iPS-based technologies and the potential utility for retinal degenerative diseases. We also discuss the challenges of using this technology in the retinology field.</p>

				<title>The molecular genetic basis of age-related macular degeneration: an overview</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0425-0449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex disorder of the eye and the third leading cause of blindness worldwide. With a multifactorial etiology, AMD results in progressive loss of central vision affecting the macular region of the eye in elderly. While the prevalence is relatively higher in the Caucasian populations, it has gradually become a major public health issue among the non-Caucasian populations (including Indians) as well due to senescence, rapidly changing demographics and life-style factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on large case–control cohorts have helped in mapping genes in the complement cascade that are involved in the regulation of innate immunity with AMD susceptibility. Genes involved with mitochondrial oxidative stress and extracellular matrix regulation also play a role in AMD pathogenesis. Majority of the associations observed in complement (<i>CFH, CFB, C2</i> and <i>C3</i>) and other (<i>ARMS2</i> and <i>HTRA1</i>) genes have been replicated in diverse populations worldwide. Gene–gene (<i>CFH</i> with <i>ARMS2</i> and <i>HTRA1</i>) interactions and correlations with environmental traits (smoking and body mass index) have been established as significant covariates in AMD pathology. In this review, we have provided an overview on the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms in AMD worldwide and highlight the AMD-associated-candidate genes and their potential role in disease pathogenesis.</p>

				<title>Molecular complexity of primary open angle glaucoma: current concepts</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0451-0467</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glaucoma is a group of heterogeneous optic neuropathies with complex genetic basis. Among the three principle subtypes of glaucoma, primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) occurs most frequently. Till date, 25 loci have been found to be linked to POAG. However, only three underlying genes (<i>Myocilin, Optineurin</i> and <i>WDR36</i>) have been identified. In addition, at least 30 other genes have been reported to be associated with POAG. Despite strong genetic influence in POAG pathogenesis, only a small part of the disease can be explained in terms of genetic aberration. Current concepts of glaucoma pathogenesis suggest it to be a neurodegenerative disorder which is triggered by different factors including mechanical stress due to intra-ocular pressure, reduced blood flow to retina, reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, and aberrant immune response. Here we present a mechanistic overview of potential pathways and crosstalk between them operating in POAG pathogenesis.</p>

				<title>Mouse models of cataract</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0469-0486</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Much of our knowledge about the function of genes in cataracts has been derived from the molecular analysis of spontaneous or induced mutations in the mouse. Mutations affecting the mouse lens can be identified easily by visual inspection, and a remarkable number of mutant lines have been characterized. In contrast to humans, most of the genetic mouse cataract models suffer from congenital cataracts, and only a few develop cataracts in old age. Therefore, the mouse cataract models contributed rather to the understanding of lens development than to the ageing process taking place in the lens. A prerequisite formolecular analysis is the chromosomal localization of the gene. In this review, several mouse models will be discussed with emphasis on the underlying genetic basis rather than the morphological features as exemplified by the following:</p>
					<ol type="roman">
						<li>the most frequent mutations in congenital cataracts affect genes coding for $\gamma$-crystallins (gene symbol: <i>Cryg</i>);</li>
						<li>some postnatal, progressive cataracts have been characterized by mutations in the $\beta$-crystallin encoding genes (<i>Cryb</i>);</li>
						<li>mutations in genes coding for membrane proteins like MIP or connexins lead to congenital cataracts;</li>
						<li>mutations in genes coding for transcription factors such as <i>FoxE3, Maf, Sox1</i>, and <i>Six5</i> cause cataracts;</li>
						<li>mouse models suffering from hereditary age-related cataracts (e.g. Emory cataract) have not yet been characterized genetically.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>In conclusion, a broad variety of hereditary congenital cataracts are well understood at the molecular level. Further, expression patterns of the affected genes in several other tissues and organs outside the eye, is making it increasingly clear that isolated cataracts are the exception rather than the rule. By further understanding the pleiotropic effects of these genes, we might recognize cataracts as an easily visible biomarker for a number of systemic syndromes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The corneal endothelium maintains the level of hydration in the cornea. Dysfunction of the endothelium results in excess accumulation of water in the corneal stroma, leading to swelling of the stroma and loss of transparency. There are four different corneal endothelial dystrophies that are hereditary, progressive, non-inflammatory disorders involving dysfunction of the corneal endothelium. Each of the endothelial dystrophies is genetically heterogeneous with different modes of transmission and/or different genes involved in each subtype. Genes responsible for disease have been identified for only a subset of corneal endothelial dystrophies. Knowledge of genes involved and their function in the corneal endothelium can aid understanding the pathogenesis of the disorder as well as reveal pathways that are important for normal functioning of the endothelium.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. It is brought about by the mutational inactivation of both alleles of <i>RB1</i> gene in the developing retina. To identify the <i>RB1</i> mutations, we analysed 74 retinoblastoma patients by screening the exons and the promoter region of <i>RB1</i>. The strategy used was to detect large deletions/duplications by fluorescent quantitative multiplex PCR; small deletions/insertions by fluorescent genotyping of <i>RB1</i> alleles, and point mutations by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Genomic DNA from the peripheral blood leucocytes of 74 Rb patients (53 with bilateral Rb, 21 with unilateral Rb; 4 familial cases) was screened for mutations. Recurrent mutations were identified in five patients with bilateral Rb, large deletions in 11 patients (nine with bilateral Rb and two with unilateral Rb), small deletions/insertions were found in 12 patients all with bilateral Rb, and point mutations in 26 patients (14 nonsense, six splice site, five substitution and one silent change). Three mutations were associated with variable expressivity of the disease in different family members. Using this method, the detection rates achieved in patients with bilateral Rb were 44/53 (83\%) and with unilateral Rb, 5/21 (23.8\%). This approach may be feasible for clinical genetic testing and counselling of patients.</p>
