				<title>End depth in steeply sloping rough rectangular channels</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presents a theoretical model to compute the end depth of a free overfall in steeply sloping rough rectangular channels. A momentum equation based on the Boussinesq approximation is applied to obtain the equation of the end depth. The effect ofstreamline curvature at the free surface is utilized to develop the differential equation for the flow profile upstream of the free overfall of a wide rectangular channel. As direct solutions for the end depth and flow profile cannot be obtained owing to implicit forms of the developed equations, an auto-recursive search scheme is evolved to solve these equations simultaneously. A method for estimation of discharge from the known end depth and Nikuradse equivalent sand roughness is also presented. Results from the present model correspond satisfactorily with experimental observations except for some higher roughnesses.</p>

				<title>Effect of advanced injection timing on the performence of natural gas in diesel engines</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0011-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Concern over the environment and/or the increasing demand for conventional fossil fuel has promoted interest in the development of alternative sources of fuel energy for internal combustion (IC) engines. The effect ofadvanced injection timing on the performance of natural gas used as primary fuel in dual-fuel combustion has been examined. Satisfactory diesel engine combustion demands self-ignition of the fuel as it is injected near the top dead centre (TDC) into the hot swirling compressed cylinder gas. Longer delays between injection and ignition lead to unacceptable rates of pressure rise (diesel knock) because too much fuel is ready to burn when combustion eventually occurs. Natural gas has been noted to exhibit longer ignition delays and slower burning rates especially at low load levels hence resulting in late combustion in the expansion stroke. Advanced injection timing is expected to compensate for these effects. The engine has standard injection timing of $30^\circ $ before TDC (BTDC). The injection was first advanced by $5.5^\circ $ given injection timing of $35.5^\circ $ BTDC. The engine ran for about 5 minutes at this timing and stopped. The engine failed to start upon subsequent attempts. The injection was then advanced by $3.5^\circ $ (i.e. $33.5^\circ $ BTDC). The engine ran smoothly on this timing butseemed to incur penalty on fuel consumption especially at high load levels.</p>

				<title>Behaviour of Lagrangian triangular mixed fluid finite elements</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0021-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The behaviour of mixed fluid finite elements, formulated based on the Lagrangian frame of reference, is investigated to understand the effects of locking due to incompressibility and irrotational constraints. For this purpose, both linear and quadratic mixed triangular fluid elements are formulated. It is found that there exists a close relationship between the penalty finite element approach that uses reduced/selective numerical integration to alleviate locking, and the mixed finite element approach. That is, performing reduced/selective integration in the penalty approach amounts to reducing the order of pressure interpolation in the mixed finite element approach for obtaining similar results. A number of numerical experiments are performed to determine the optimum degree of interpolation of both the mean pressure and the rotational pressure in order that the twin constraints are satisfied exactly. For this purpose, the benchmark solution of the rigid rectangular tank is used. It is found that, irrespective of the degree of mean and the rotational pressure interpolation, the linear triangle mesh, with or without central bubble function (incompatible mode), locks when both the constraints are enforced simultaneously. However, for quadratic triangle, linear interpolation of the mean pressure and constant rotational pressure ensures exact satisfaction of the constraints and the mesh does not lock. Based on the results obtained from the numerical experiments, a number of important conclusions are arrived at.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The pyramid algorithm is potentially a powerful tool for advanced television image processing and for pattern recognition. An attempt is made to design and develop both hardware and software for a system which performs decomposition and reconstruction of digitized images by implementing the Burt pyramid algorithm.</p>
					<p>In this work, an attempt is also made to study correlation performance on reconstructed images. That is, the reference image is taken from the original image and correlation is performed on expanded images of the same size. Similarly, correlation performance study is carried out on different pyramid- processed levels. In this paper results are presented in terms of RMS error between original and expanded images. Only still images are considered, and the hardware is designed around an $i486$ processor and software is developed in PL/M 86.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0057-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The indigenous design, fabrication and performance evaluation of a polychromator, using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) as a source of excitation, are described. A concave holographic grating is used asthe dispersing element and a Paschen$-$Runge mount is chosen to focus the spectra over a wide range along the Rowland circle. Twenty-two exitslits, mounted along the circle, precisely correspond to the wavelengths used for determination of up to twenty elements present in the plasma. Radiations emerging from the exit slits are detected by photomultiplier tubes placed behind them. The photomultipliersignal isrecorded by an electronic system consisting of an integrator and a PC-based data acquisition system. The performance of the spectrometer has been evaluated with an ICP excitation source. Synthetic standards in deionized water containing a mixture of twenty impurities have been analysed. Typical determination limits observed for elements range from sub-ppm to ppm levels. All the elements present as impurities can be detected simultaneously. It is also observed that each element has a different emitting region in the ICP flame for which the maximum signal to the background is obtained. The determination limits obtained corresponding to these zones are the lowest. A study of the sensitive emitting zones for several elements has been carried out and the results are demonstrated by photographs of the ICP flame. The study will help in achieving the minimum value of determination limitfor an impurity element.</p>

					<p>This paper presents an introductory survey ofthe methodsthat have been developed for identification of continuous-time systems from samples of input$-$output data. The two basic approaches may be described as (i) the indirect method, where first a discrete-time model is estimated from the sampled data and then an equivalent continuous-time model is calculated, and (ii) the direct method based on concepts of approximate numerical integration, where a continuous-time model is obtained directly without going through the intermediate step of first determining a discrete-time model.</p>

				<page>0085-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An improved system blind identification method based on second-order cyclostationary statistics and the properties of group delay, has been proposed. This is achieved by applying a correction to the estimated phase (by the spectral correlation density of the system output) for the poles, in the group delay domain. The results indicate a significant improvement in system blind identification, in terms of root mean square error. Depending upon the signal-to-noise ratio, the improvement in percentage normalized mean square error ranges between 20 and 50%.</p>

				<title>Linear approximation model network and its formation via evolutionary computation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To overcome the deficiency of `local model network' (LMN) techniques, an alternative `linear approximation model' (LAM) network approach is proposed. Such a network models a nonlinear or practical system with multiple linear models fitted along operating trajectories, where individual models are simply networked through output or parameter interpolation. The linear models are valid for the entire operating trajectory and hence overcome the local validity of LMN models, which impose the predetermination of a scheduling variable that predicts characteristic changes of the nonlinear system. LAMs can be evolved fromsampled step response data directly, eliminating the need forlocal linearisation upon a pre-model using derivatives of the nonlinear system. The structural difference between a LAM network and an LMN isthat the overall model of the latteris a parameter-varying system and hence nonlinear,while the formerremains linear time-invariant (LTI). Hence, existing LTI and transfer function theory applies to a LAM network, which is therefore easy to use for control system design. Validation results show that the proposed method offers a simple, transparent and accurate multivariable modelling technique for nonlinear systems.</p>

				<page>0111-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radiogenic heat sources present in the continental crust contribute significantly to the total surface heat flow and temperature distribution in the crust. Various modelsforthe depth distribution of radiogenic sources have been proposed. Among these modelsthe exponential model has been shown to be an optimal, smooth model through the variational approach applied to the heat conduction equation. In the present work, a two-layered model of the crust is considered and heat transport by advection is included in the upper layer. The heat transport in the lower layer is by conduction only. Application of variational principle determines the nature of the radiogenic source distribution in both the layers. The resultsthus obtained indicate a radiogenic source distribution which is more complex than a simple exponential model.</p>

				<title>Aircraft parameter estimation $-$ A tool for development of aerodynamic databases</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0119-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With the evolution of high performance modern aircraft and spiraling developmental and experimental costs, the importance of flight validated databases for flight control design applications and for flight simulators has increased significantly in the recent past. Ground-based and in-flight simulators are increasingly used not only for pilot training but also for other applications such asflight planning, envelope expansion, design and analysis of control laws, and handling qualitiesinvestigations. Most of these demand a high-fidelity aerodynamic database representing the flight vehicle. System identification methodology, evolved over the past three decades, provides a powerful and sophisticated tool to identify from flight data aerodynamic characteristics valid over the entire operational flight envelope. This paper briefly presents aircraft parameter estimation methods for both stable and unstable aircraft, highlighting the developmental work at the DLR Institute of Flight Mechanics. Various aspects of database identification and its validation are presented. Practical aspectslike the proper choice of integration and optimization methods as well as limitations of gradient approximation through finite-differences are brought out. Though the paper focuses on application of system identification methodsto flight vehicles, its use in other applications, like the modelling of inelastic deformations of metallic materials, is also presented. It is shown that there are many similar problems and several challenges requiring additional concepts and algorithms.</p>

				<title>On-line identification, flutter testing and adaptive notching of structural parameters for V-22 tiltrotor aircraft</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0137-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New algorithms and results are presented for flutter testing and adaptive notching of structural modes in V-22 tiltrotor aircraft based on simulated and flight-test data from Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI). For flutter testing and the identification of structural mode frequencies, dampings and mode shapes, time domain state space techniques based on Deterministic Stochastic Realization Algorithms (DSRA) are used to accurately identify multiple modessimultaneously from sine sweep and other multifrequency data, resulting in great savings over the conventional Prony method. Two different techniques for adaptive notching are explored in order to design an Integrated Flight Structural Control (IFSC) system. The first technique is based on on-line identification of structural mode parameters using DSRA algorithm and tuning of a notch filter. The second technique is based on decoupling rigid-body and structural modes of the aircraft by means of a Kalman filter and using rigid-body estimates in the feedback control loop. The difference between the two approaches is that on-line identification and adaptive notching in the first approach are entirely based on the knowledge of structural modes, whereas the Kalman filter design in the second approach is based on the rigid-body dynamic model only.In the first IFSC design, on-line identification is necessary for flight envelope expansion and to adjust the notch filter frequencies and suppress aero-servoelastic instabilities due to changing flight conditionssuch as gross weight, sling loads, and airspeed. It isshown that by tuning the notch filterfrequency to the identified frequency, the phase lag is reduced and the corresponding structural mode is effectively suppressed and stability is maintained. In the second IFSC design using Kalman filter design, the structural modes are again effectively suppressed. Furthermore, the rigid-body estimates are found to be fairly insensitive to both natural frequency and damping factor variations and therefore stability is maintained. The Kalman filter design might be a better choice when the rigid-body dynamics are well known because no adaptation is necessary in this case.</p>

The suggested model has properties of the basic neuron model as well as the higher neuron model (multiplicative aggregation function). It can adapt to standard neuron and higher order neuron, as well as a combination of the two. This approach is found to estimate the orbit with accuracy significantly better than Kalman Filter (KF) and Feedforward Multilayer Neural Network (FMNN) (also simply referred to as Artificial Neural Network, ANN) with lambda-gamma learning. The typical simulation runs also bring out the superiority of the proposed scheme over Kalman filter from the standpoint of computation time and the amount of data needed for the desired degree of estimated accuracy for the specific problem of orbit determination.</p>

				<page>0247-0259</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Vibration and acoustic requirements are becoming increasingly important in the design of mechanical structures, but they are not usually of primary concern in the design process. So the need to vary the structural behaviour to solve noise and vibration problems often occurs at the prototype stage, giving rise to the so-called structural modification problem. In this paper, the direct problem of determing the new response of a system, after some modifications are introduced into the sestem, is analysed using two different databases: the modal database and the frequency response function database. The limitaions of the modal database are discussed. Structural modifications that can be accounted for are lumped masses, springs, dampers and dynamic absorbers.</p>

The models assumed in this discussion are mathematical models, namely mass, stiffness, and damping matrices of the equations of motion of a structure. These models are identified/extracted from dynamic test data viz. frequency response functions (FRFs). Alternatively these models could have been obtained by adjusting or updating the finite element model of the structure in the light of the test data.

				<title>Sensitivity analysis and its application for dynamic improvement</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0291-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to determine appropriate points where natural frequency or mode shape under consideration can be effectively modified by structural modification, the theoretical background of sensitivity analysis is described, followed by experimental verification with a simple structure. Then it can be extended to (1) operational deflection shape, where a problem arise at off-resonance frequency, (2) relative motion, (3) transmitted force through connecting points between components, (4) servo system, which consists of electrical elements with mechanical elements, and (5) acoustics generated by the vibration of the structure. To illusrate its effectiveness, many actual examples are given.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The method of structural dynamic optimization is applied here to two real-life structures, a small two-cylinder, air-cooled gasoline engine and a high speed machine tool. The aim of the first application isthe reduction of the kinematic vibration transmission path composed of a piston-connecting rod, a crankshaft and an engine block, while the goal of the second application is the lowering of the peaks of the spindle-drive point FRFs measured along two orthogonal directions.It is shown how the addition of a small amount of mass at a few points on the engine block, and a small dynamic absorber with highly damped elastic connections provides the required improvements for the engine and the machine tool respectively.</p>

					<p>It is advisable and better to consider noise control measures at the design stage itself rather than after the product is manufactured and installed. The present paper describes some of the control measures that can be incorporated during the design of machines and structures. Vibration control, barriers and enclosures can be used for noise control and should be considered at the design stage. Acoustical materials which can be used for noise control purpose have been described. Some examples of noise-reducing design are also given.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear analysis of doubly curved shells: An analytical approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0343-0352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dynamic analogues of vin Karman-Donnell type shell equations for doubly curved, thin isotropic shells in rectangular planform are formulated and expressed in displacement components. These nonlinear partial differential equations of motion are linearized by using a quadratic extrapolation technique. The spatial and temporal discretization of differential equatoins have been carried out  by finite-degree Chebyshev polynomials and implicit Houbolt time-marching techniques respectively. Multiple regression besed on the least square error norm is employed to eliminate the incompatability generated due to spatial discretization (equations $>$ unknowns). Spatial convergence study revealed that nine term expansion of each displacement in $x$ and $y$ respectively, is sufficient to yield fairly accurate results. Clamped and simply supported immovable doubly curved shallow shells are analysed. Results have been compared with those obtained by other numerical methods. Considering uniformly distributed normal loading, the results of static and dynamic analyses are presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Though the use of the integrated force method for linear investigations is well-recognised, no efforts were made to extend this method to nonlinear structural analysis. This paper presents the attempts to use this method for analysing nonlinear structures. General formulation of nonlinear structural analysis is given. Typically highly nonlinear bench-mark problems are considered. The characteristic matrices of the elements used in these problems are developed and later these structures are analysed. The results of the analysis are compared with the results of the displacement method. It has been demonstrated that the integrated force method is equally viable and efficient as compared to the displacement method.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear oscillations of laminated plates using an accurate four-node rectangular shear flexible material finite element</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0367-0380</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of the present paper is to investigate the large amplitude vibratory  behaviour of unsymmetrically laminated plates. For this purpose, an efficient and accurate four-node shear flexible rectangular material finite element(MFE) with six degrees offreedom per node (three displacements $(u;v;w)$ along the $x, y$ and $z$ axes, two rotations ($\theta_x$ and $\theta_y$) about $y$ and $x$ axes and twist $(\theta_{xy})$) is developed. The element assumes bi-cubic polynomial distribution with sixteen generalized undetermined coefficients for the transverse displacement. The fields for section rotations $\theta_x$ and $\theta_y$, and in-plane displacements $u$ and $v$ are derived using moment-shear equilibrium and in-plane equilibrium equations of composite strips along the $x$- and $y$-axes. The displacement field so derived not only depends on the element coordinates but is a function of extensional, bending-extensional coupling, bending and transverse shear stiffness as well. The element stiffness and mass matrices are computed numerically by employing $3\times 3$ Gauss-Legendre product rules. The element is found to be free of shear locking and does not exhibit any spurious modes. In orderto compute the nonlinearfrequencies, linear mode shape corresponding to the fundamental frequency is assumed as the spatial distribution and nonlinear finite element equations are reduced to a single nonlinear second-order differential equation. This equation is solved by employing the direct numerical integration method. A series of numerical examples are solved to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed element.</p>

				<title>An efficient method for nonlinear analysis of layered shells</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0381-0408</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Finite element formulation based on explicit through-thickness integration scheme assumes importance when applied to multilayered shells, as it is numerically accurate and computationally efficient. Explicit integration becomes possible on assuming the variation of the inverse Jacobian through the thickness. The element stiffness matrices are discussed for (i) large rotation, and (ii) small rotation. Relative efficiencies of the explicit through-thickness integration schemes are compared with that of the conventional formulation involving numerical integration in three directions in each layer and summation over the layers. The small rotation formulation assuming linear variation of the Jacobian inverse across the thickness and based on further approximation regarding certain submatrices is seen to be computationally efficient. The geometric nonlinear behaviours of laminated composite cylindrical panels subjected to external pressure are discussed. The parameters considered are: number of layers, symmetric/antisymmetric, cross-ply$/$angle-ply, boundary conditions and central angle. The strength of shallow panels with longitudinal edges hinged and curved edges free is controlled by the limit point load, while for deep panels it is controlled by the bifurcation load. The boundary conditions have significant influence on load carrying capacities.</p>

				<title>Delamination tolerance studies in laminated composite panels</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0409-0422</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Determination of levels of tolerance in delaminated composite panels is an important issue in composite structures technology. The primary intention is to analyse delaminated composite panels and estimate Strain Energy Release Rate (SERR) parameters at the delamination front to feed into acceptability criteria. Large deformation analysis is necessary to cater for excessive rotational deformations in the delaminated sublaminate. Modified Virtual Crack Closure Integral (MVCCI) is used to estimate all the three SERR components at the delamination front from the finite element output containing displacements, strains and stresses. The applied loading conditions are particularly critical and compressive loading on the panel could lead to buckling of the delaminated sublaminate and consequent growth of delamination. Numerical results are presented for circular delamination of varioussizes and delamination at various interfaces (varying depth-wise location) between the base- and the sub-laminates. Numerical data are also presented on the effect of bi-axial loading and in particular on compressive loading in both directions. The results can be used to estimate delamination tolerance at various depths (or at various interfaces) in the laminate.</p>

					<p>In our earlier work we have shown the relevance of stability theory in understanding the sustenance of turbulence in turbulent boundary layers. Here we adopt the same model to study the evolution of organised disturbances in turbulent channel flow. Since the dominant modes are wall modes we find that the stability characteristics in the two flows are nearly identical although the boundary conditions (at the edge of the boundary layer and at the centre of the channel) are different.

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0453-0461</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A diffuser augmented wind turbine (DAWT) is considered an important application of the advanced concepts to improve the attractiveness of wind energy. The present paper aims to find a theoretical demonstration of DAWT by using theoretical analysis, mathematical models, assumptions, estimations and maximization of power coefficients and augmentation ratios, in addition to computer programs for calculations and drawings. The final results show that the maximum power coefficient $(Cpd_0)$ and augmentation ratio $(R_b)-$ relative to Betz $-$ are directly proportional to pressure recovery factor $(Cr)$, turbine factor $(Ct)$, and maximum velocity ratio $(No)$, but inversely proportional to overall recovery factor $(C_0)$ of diffuser. The power coefficient $(Cpd_0)$ of DAWT reaches 1.5 at $C_0 \cong -0.5$, $No \cong 1.0$ and $Cr \cong 0.5$, but the augmentation ratio $(R_b)$ reaches 6.0 at $C_0 \cong -0.5, Cr \cong 0.9$, and reaches 7.0 at $N0 \cong 1.0$ and $Ct \cong 1.0$, which gives a good application for DAWT systems.</p>

					<p>Ternary sequences have superior merit factors but they cannot be transmitted with existing technology. It is proposed that a ternary sequence be coded into a binary sequence for the purpose of transmission. On reception it can be processed as a binary sequence as received and also decoded into a ternary sequence. These two interpretations provide a coincidence detection scheme for efficient target detection provided that the corresponding signal design problem is solved. Such an algorithm is developed by taking the merit factor as desideratum and the Hamming scan as optimization technique. Merit factor values obtained in some cases are further improved by implementing a back-tracking algorithm for bi-alphabetic sequence.</p>

				<page>0489-0510</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Checkpoint is defined as a designated place in a program at which normal processing is interrupted specifically to preserve the status information necessary to allow resumption of processing at a later time. Checkpointing is the process of saving the status information. This paper surveysthe algorithms which have been reported in the literature for checkpointing parallel$/$distributed systems. It has been observed that most of the algorithms published for checkpointing in message passing systems are based on the seminal article by Chandy and Lamport. A large number of articles have been published in this area by relaxing the assumptions made in this paper and by extending it to minimise the overheads of coordination and context saving. Checkpointing for sharedmemory systems primarily extend cache coherence protocolstomaintain a consistent memory. All of them assume that the main memory is safe for storing the context. Recently algorithms have been published for distributed shared memory systems, which extend the cache coherence protocols used in shared memory systems. They however also include methods for storing the status of distributed memory in stable storage. Most of the algorithms assume that there is no knowledge about the programs being executed.It is howeverfelt that in development of parallel programs the user has to do a fair amount of work in distributing tasks and this information can be effectively used to simplify checkpointing and rollback recovery.</p>

By applying different software$/$hardware techniques, the execution time has been brought down from a few seconds to a few milliseconds for a typical set of conditions.

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0519-0559</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reliable performance and profitability are two important requirements for any chemical industry. In order to achieve high level of reliability and excellent performance, several issues related to design, materials selection, fabrication, quality assurance, transport, storage, inputs from condition monitoring, failure analysis etc. have to be adequately addressed and implemented. Technology related to nondestructive testing and monitoring of the plant is also essential for precise identification of defect sites and to take appropriate remedial decision regarding repair, replacement or modification of process conditions. The interdisciplinary holistic approach enhances the life of critical engineering components in chemical plants. Further, understanding the failure modes of the components through the analysis of failed components throws light on the choice of appropriate preventive measures to be taken well in advance, to have a control over the overall health of the plant. The failure analysis also leads to better design modification and condition monitoring methodologies, for the next generation components and plants. At the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam, a unique combination of the expertise in design, materials selection, fabrication, NDT development, condition monitoring, life prediction and failure analysis exists to obtain desired results for achieving high levels of reliability and performance assessment of critical engineering components in chemical industries. Case studies related to design, materials selection and fabrication aspects of critical components in nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, NDT development and condition monitoring of various components of nuclear power plants, and important failure investigations on critical engineering components in chemical and allied industries are discussed in this paper. Future directions are identified and planned approaches are briefly described.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0561-0587</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, cohesive zone models have been employed to simulate fracture and delamination in solids. This paper presents in detail the formulation for incorporating cohesive zone models within the framework of a large deformation finite element procedure. A special Ritz-finite element technique is employed to control nodal instabilities that may arise when the cohesive elements experience material softening and lose their stress carrying capacity. A few simple problems are presented to validate the implementation of the cohesive element formulation and to demonstrate the robustness of the Ritz solution method. Finally, quasi-static crack growth along the interface in an adhesively bonded system is simulated employing the cohesive zone model. The crack growth resistance curves obtained from the simulations show trends similar to those observed in experimental studies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Numerical treatment of the linear stability equations is undertaken to investigate the occurrence of direct spatial resonance events in the boundary layer flow due to a rotating-disk. A spectral solution of the eigenvalue problem indicates that algebraic growth of the perturbations shows up, prior to the amplification of exponentially growing instability waves. This phenomenon takes place while the flow is still in the laminar state and it also tends to persist further even if the non-parallelism is taken into account. As a result, there exists the high possibility of this instability mechanism giving rise to nonlinearity and transition, long before the unboundedly growing time-amplified waves.</p>

				<title>Segregation in cast products</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0005-0024</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microsegregation gets eliminated significantly if subsequent hot working and/or annealing are done on cast products. Macrosegregation however persists, causing problems in quality, and hence, has to be attended to. Microsegregation is a consequence of rejection of solutes by the solid into the interdendritic liquid. Scheil’s  equation is mostly employed. However, other equations have been proposed, which take into account diffusion in solid phase and/or incomplete mixing in liquid.</p>
					<p>Macrosegregation results from movements of microsegregated regions over macroscopic distances due to motion of liquid and free crystals. Motion of impure interdendritic liquid causes regions of positive macrosegregation, whereas purer solid crystals yield negative macrosegregation. Flow of interdendritic liquid is primarily natural convection due to thermal and solutal buoyancy, and partly forced convection due to suction by shrinkage cavity formation etc.</p>
					<p>The present paper briefly deals with fundamentals of the above and contains some recent studies as well. Experimental investigations in molten alloys do not allow visualization of the complex flow pattern as well as other phenomena, such as dendrite-tip detachment. Experiments with room temperature analogues, and mathematical modelling have supplemented these efforts. However, the complexity of the phenomena demands simplifying assumptions. The agreement with experimental data is mostly qualitative.</p>
					<p>The paper also briefly discusses centreline macrosegregation during continuous casting of steel, methods to avoid it, and the, importance of early columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) as well as the fundamentals of CET.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0025-0034</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present article, evolution of microstructure during solidification, as a function of various parameters, is discussed. Macrosegregation is described as being due to insufficient diffusivity of solute in the solid. Pattern formation is discussed in the light of instabilities at the solidification growth front. An overview of the scaling relations for various microstructures is given. Metastable extensions to equilibrium phase diagrams and corrections to equilibrium quantities are described.</p>

				<title>Finite element modelling of solidification phenomena</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0103-0120</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The process of solidification process is complex in nature and the simulation of such process is required in industry before it is actually undertaken. Finite element method is used to simulate the heat transfer process  accompanying the solidification process. The metal and the mould along with the air gap formation is accounted in the heat transfer simulation. Distortion of  the casting is caused due to non-uniform shrinkage associated with the process. Residual stresses are induced in the final castings. Simulation of the shrinkage and the thermal stresses are also carried out using finite element methods. The material behaviour is considered as visco-plastic. The simulations are compared with available experimental data and the comparison is found to be good. Special considerations regarding the simulation of solidification process are also brought out.</p>

				<page>0139-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The role of convection during solidification is studied with the help of a mathematical model. The effect of various mush models on convection and consequent macrosegregation is examined with the help of numerical simulations. The predicted macrosegregation profiles are compared with published experimental data. Subsequently, the importance of proper auxiliary relationship for thermo-solutal coupling in the mushy region is highlighted through some careful numerical simulations. Finally, the role of material parameters on double-diffusive convection is illustrated through comparative study of solidification of aqueous ammonium chloride, iron$–$carbon and lead$–$tin binary systems. Important results of these studies are presented and discussed.</p>

				<page>0179-0198</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An integrated understanding of heat transfer during solidification, friction/lubrication at solid$–$liquid interface, high temperature properties of the solidifying shell etc. is necessary to control the continuous casting process. The present paper elaborates upon the knowledge developed in the areas of initial shell formation, mode of mould oscillation, and lubrication mechanism. The effect of these issues on the caster productivity and the quality of the product has been discussed. The influence of steel chemistry on solidification dynamics, particularly with respect to mode of solidification and its consequence on strength and ductility of the solidifying shell, has been dealt with in detail. The application of these basic principles for casting of stainless steel slabs and processing to obtain good quality products have been covered.</p>

				<page>0213-0225</page>
				<abstract>
				<p>An indigenous and simple electronic control system for Langmuir$–$Blodgett (LB) film deposition set-up has been developed. This set-up consists of a microstepping circuit to drive the stepper motors with precision and smooth motion, essential for controlled movement of the barriers and substrate in the LB set-up. Linear variable differential transformer (LVDT)-based displacement measuring device has been developed and used to measure the surface pressure of the monolayer material spread on the water surface. A control program is written which incorporates all operational modes required to drive the set-up and to acquire the data $\textit{in situ}$ using a set of user-friendly commands. This control set-up has been successfully used to plot the pressure-area isotherm of various amphiphilic compounds such as ferric stearate, zinc arachidate etc. and for deposition of ordered LB films of ferric stearate.</p>

			<title>Robust correlation tracker</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0227-0236</page>
				<abstract>
				<p>Correlation tracking plays an important role in the automation of weapon systems. Area correlation is an effective technique for tracking targets that have neither prominent features nor high contrast with the background and  the ‘target’ can even be an area or a scene of interest. Even though this technique is robust under varying conditions of target background and light conditions, it has some problems like target drift and false registration. When the tracker or target is moving, the registration point drifts due to the discrete pixel size and aspect angle change.</p>
				<p>In this research work, an attempt has been made to improve the performance of a correlation tracker for tracking ground targets with very poor contrast. In the present work only the CCD visible images with very poor target to background contrast are considered.</p>
				<p>Applying novel linear and nonlinear filters, the problems present in the correlation tracker are overcome. Confidence and redundancy measures have been proposed to improve the performance by detecting misregistration. The proposed algorithm is tested on different sequences of images and its performance is satisfactory.</p>

			<title>Finite element simulation of internal flows with heat transfer using a velocity correction approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0251-0283</page>
				<abstract>
				<p>This paper enumerates finite-element based prediction of internal flow problems, with heat transfer. The present numerical simulations employ a velocity correction algorithm, with a Galerkin weighted residual formulation. Two problems each in laminar and turbulent flow regimes are investigated, by solving full Navier$–$Stokes equations. Flow over a backward-facing step is studied with extensive validations. The robustness of the algorithm is demonstrated by solving a very complex problem viz. a disk and doughnut baffled heat exchanger, which has several obstructions in its flow path. The effect of wall conductivity in turbulent heat transfer is also studied by performing a conjugate analysis. Temporal evolution of flow in a channel due to circular, square and elliptic obstructions is investigated, to simulate the vortex dynamics. Flow past an in-line tube bank of a heat exchanger shell is numerically studied. Resulting heat and fluid flow patterns are analysed. Important design parameters of interest such as the Nusselt number, Strouhal number, skin friction coefficient, pressure drop etc. are obtained. It is successfully demonstrated that the velocity correction approach with a Galerkin weighted residual formulation is able to effectively simulate a wide range of fluid flow features.</p>

				<p>A cylindrical furnace with three heating zones, capable of providing a temperature of $1100^\circ C$, has been fabricated to enable recording of absorption spectra of high temperature species. The temperature of the furnace can be controlled to $\pm 1^\circ C$ of the set temperature. The salient feature of this furnace is that the material being heated can be prevented from depositing on the windows of the absorption cell by maintaining a higher temperature at both the ends of the absorption cell.</p>

				<p>This paper presents the state-of-the-art on application of optimisation techniques in groundwater quality and quantity management. In order to solve optimisation-based groundwater management models, researchers have used various mathematical programming techniques such as linear programming (LP), nonlinear programming (NLP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), optimal control theory-based mathematical programming, differential dynamic programming (DDP), stochastic programming (SP), combinatorial optimisation (CO), and multiple objective programming for multipurpose management. Studies reported in the literature on the application of these methods are reviewed in this paper.</p>

				<title>Simulation of sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers: Some typical responses</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0317-0352</page>
				<abstract>
				<p>Seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers is generally three dimensional (3-D) in nature. In the literature, there is a general lack of reported results on 3-D simulations. This paper presents some typical example simulations of 3-D seawater intrusion process for a speciﬁed hypothetical study area. The simulation results presented in this paper are based on the density-dependent miscible ﬂow and transport modelling approach for simulation of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. A nonlinear optimization-based simulation methodology was used in this study. Various steady state simulations are performed for a speciﬁed study area. Response evaluations consider the effects of vertical recharge on seawater intrusion, effects of boundary conditions, and effects of spatially varying pumping from the aquifer. The 3-D simulations demonstrate the viability of using a planned strategy of spatially varying withdrawals from the aquifer to manage seawater intrusion. It is demonstrated that series of pumps near the ocean-face boundary induce a hydraulic head distribution that can be effectively used for controlling seawater intrusion.</p>

First, the theory of general surface waves has been derived and applied to study the particular cases of surface waves – Rayleigh, Love and Stoneley types. The wave velocity equations are found to be in agreement with the corresponding classical result when the anisotropic elastic parameters tends to zero. It is important to note that the Rayleigh type of wave velocity in the ﬁbre-reinforced elastic medium increases to a considerable amount in comparison with the Rayleigh wave velocity in isotropic materials.</p>

				<title>Fundamentally excited ﬂow past a surface-mounted rib. Part I: Turbulent structure characterisation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0387-0412</page>
				<abstract>
				<p>Different data analysis techniques for characterisation of the turbulent ﬂow past a surface-mounted rib are reviewed. Deﬁciencies of the existing techniques are explained and modiﬁed techniques for determination of coherent structure magnitude and phase jitter are suggested. The effect of fundamental excitation on the ﬂow is studied by using these turbulent signal analysis techniques. The appropriate length scale for characterizing the large-scale structures present in the reattaching shear layer of the surface-mounted rib is found to be the momentum thickness at the downstream edge of the rib, and the corresponding Strouhal number is 0.013. This is in contrast to a rib in the free stream, where the rib height is the correct scaling parameter. The post reattachment region is observed to be dominated by large-scale structures contrary to the traditional belief that large eddies break into small scales at the reattachment location. Low magnitude of phase jitter in the near ﬁeld region is observed, indicating coherence of the ﬂow structures. Phase decorrelation begins to occur beyond three rib heights from the downstream edge of the rib. From the quadrant analysis results, the outer edge of the shear layer is observed to be dominated by large-scale ejection motions.</p>

				<abstract>
				<p>This paper presents the detailed turbulent kinetic energy budget and higher order statistics of ﬂow behind a surface-mounted rib with and without superimposed acoustic excitation. Pattern recognition technique is used to determine the large-scale structure magnitude. It is observed that most of the turbulence contributions after the reattachment region are from the large-scale structures contrary to the belief that mostly random turbulent structures are present after reattachment. The dissipation is not a small-scale phenomena only. It may result due to the interaction between large-scale structures. From the results of higher order moments, the outer edge of the shear layer is observed to be non-Gaussian in nature with signiﬁcant deviation from the Gaussian skewness and ﬂatness value. The kinetic energy budget results show positive intermodal production in the outer edge of the shear layer indicating the presence of back scattering. The non-Gaussian velocity distribution, ejection motions and back-scattering present in the outer shear layer may be conjectured to be correlated with each other.</p>

				<title>A note on critical ﬂow section in collector channels</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0439-0445</page>
				<abstract>
				<p>Generalized solution for the location of critical ﬂow section in collector channels is presented. Based on the concept of the singularity, the dynamic equation of spatially varied ﬂow (SVF) is solved using the ﬂow resistance equations of von Karman (for rough regime) and Jain (for transitional and smooth regimes). The advantage of using Jain’s equations is that they provide the explicit forms of the Colebrook$–$White and Nikuradse equations. Computational steps for the determination of critical ﬂow section in a collector channel, being dependent on channel geometry, roughness, longitudinal bed slope and inﬂow discharge, are given for different channel shapes.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0447-0463</page>
				<abstract>
				<p>Product design and fabrication constitute an important business activity in any manufacturing ﬁrm. Designing an optimized product fabrication process is an important problem in itself and is of signiﬁcant practical and research interest. In this paper, we look into a printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication process and investigate ways in which the fabrication cycle time can be minimized. Single class queueing networks constitute the modelling framework for our study. The model developed in this paper and the analysis experiments carried out are based on extensive data collected on a PCB fabrication company located in Bangalore, India. This is a representative PCB fabrication company involving multiple, concurrent fabrication works with contention for human/technical resources. Our model seeks to capture faithfully the ﬂow of the fabrication process in this company and such other organisations, using queueing networks. Using the model developed, we explore how the cycle times can be reduced using input control, load balancing, and variability reduction. The model presented is sufﬁciently generic and conceptual; its scope extends beyond that of a PCB fabrication organization.</p>

				<title>A model with nonzero rise time for AE signals</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0465-0474</page>
				<abstract>
				<p>Acoustic emission (AE) signals are conventionally modelled as damped or decaying sinusoidal functions. A major drawback of this model is its negligible or zero rise time. This paper proposes an alternative model, which provides for the rising part of the signal without sacriﬁcing the analytical tractability and simplicity of the conventional model. Signals obtained from the proposed model through computer programs are illustrated for demonstrating their parity with actual AE signals. Analytic expressions for the time-domain parameters, viz., peak amplitude and rise time used in conventional AE signal analysis, are also derived. The model is believed to be also of use in modelling the output signal of any transducer that has ﬁnite rise time and fall time.</p>

				<abstract>
				<p>We propose a novel method of combining artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) with chaotic noise reduction techniques that captures the metric and dynamic invariants of a chaotic time series, e.g. a time series obtained by iterating the logistic map in chaotic regimes. Our results indicate that while the feedforward neural network is capable of capturing the dynamical and metric invariants of chaotic time series within an error of about 25%, ANNs along with chaotic noise reduction techniques, such as Hammel’s method or the local projective method, can signiﬁcantly improve these results. This further suggests that the effort on the ANN to train data corresponding to complex structures can be signiﬁcantly reduced. This technique can be applied in areas like signal processing, data communication, image processing etc.</p>

				<abstract>
				<p>A new aerodynamic modelling approach is proposed for the longitudinal static characteristics of a simple delta wing. It captures the static variation of normal force and pitching moment characteristics throughout the angle of attack range. The pressure model is based on parametrizing the surface pressure distribution on a simple delta wing. The model is then extended to a wing/body combination where body-alone data are also available. The model is shown to be simple and consistent with experimental data. The pressure model can be used as a ﬁrst approximation for the load estimation on the delta wing at high angles of attack.</p>

				<p>This paper describes the design of an in-vacuum, water-cooled beam stop (X-ray shutter) for the materials science (X-ray diffraction) beamline proposed to be built on the wavelength shifter in the Indus-2 $(2.5 GeV)$ synchrotron radiation source. The radiation source impinges $\sim 1 kW$ power on the beam stop and the heat transfer capabilities of the beam stop have been evaluated. Temperature distribution in the beam stop has been obtained under various cooling conditions using the ﬁnite element analysis calculations with ANSYS software. Design parameters of the beam stop have been optimised. It is also shown that radiation cooling alone is not sufﬁcient for taking away the heat load. Water-cooling of the beam stop is essential.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Document image analysis refers to algorithms and techniques that are applied to images of documents to obtain a computer-readable description from pixel data. A well-known document image analysis product is the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software that recognizes characters in a scanned document. OCR makes it possible for the user to edit or search the document’s contents. In this paper we brieﬂy describe various components of a document analysis system. Many of these basic building blocks are found in most document analysis systems, irrespective of the particular domain or language to which they are applied. We hope that this paper will help the reader by providing the background necessary to understand the detailed descriptions of speciﬁc techniques presented in other papers in this issue.</p>

				<page>0023-0034</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for printed $\textit{Oriya}$ script. The development of OCR for this script is difﬁcult because a large number of character shapes in the script have to be recognized. In the proposed system, the document image is ﬁrst captured using a ﬂat-bed scanner and then passed through different preprocessing modules like skew correction, line segmentation, zone detection, word and character segmentation etc. These modules have been developed by combining some conventional techniques with some newly proposed ones. Next, individual characters are recognized using a combination of stroke and run-number based features, along with features obtained from the concept of water overﬂow from a reservoir. The feature detection methods are simple and robust, and do not require preprocessing steps like thinning and pruning. A prototype of the system has been tested on a variety of printed Oriya material, and currently achieves 96.3% character level accuracy on average.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes an OCR system for printed text documents in Kannada, a South Indian language. The input to the system would be the scanned image of a page of text and the output is a machine editable ﬁle compatible with most typesetting software. The system ﬁrst extracts words from the document image and then segments the words into sub-character level pieces. The segmentation algorithm is motivated by the structure of the script. We propose a novel set of features for the recognition problem which are computationally simple to extract. The ﬁnal recognition is achieved by employing a number of 2-class classiﬁers based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. The recognition is independent of the font and size of the printed text and the system is seen to deliver reasonable performance.</p>

				<page>0073-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Identiﬁcation of the script of the text in multi-script documents is one of the important steps in the design of an OCR system for the analysis and recognition of the page. Much work has already been reported in this area relating to Roman, Arabic, Chinese, Korean and Japanese scripts. In the Indian context, though some results have been reported, the task is still at its infancy. In the work presented in this paper, a successful attempt has been made to identify the script, at the word level, in a bilingual document containing Roman and Tamil scripts. Two different approaches have been proposed and thoroughly tested. In the ﬁrst method, words are divided into three distinct spatial zones. The spatial spread of a word in upper and lower zones, together with the character density, is used to identify the script. The second technique analyses the directional energy distribution of a word using Gabor ﬁlters with suitable frequencies and orientations. Words with various font styles and sizes have been used for the testing of the proposed algorithms and the results are quite encouraging.</p>

				<title>Neural network based system for script identiﬁcation in Indian documents</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0083-0097</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper describes a neural network-based script identiﬁcation system which can be used in the machine reading of documents written in English, Hindi and Kannada language scripts. Script identiﬁcation is a basic requirement in automation of document processing, in multi-script, multi-lingual environments. The system developed includes a feature extractor and a modular neural network. The feature extractor consists of two stages. In the ﬁrst stage the document image is dilated using $3 \times 3$ masks in horizontal, vertical, right diagonal, and left diagonal directions. In the next stage, average pixel distribution is found in these resulting images. The modular network is a combination of separately trained feedforward neural network classiﬁers for each script. The system recognizes $64 \times 64$ pixel document images. In the next level, the system is modiﬁed to perform on single word-document images in the same three scripts. Modiﬁed system includes a pre-processor, modiﬁed feature extractor and probabilistic neural network classiﬁer. Pre-processor segments the multi-script multi-lingual document into individual words. The feature extractor receives these word-document images of variable size and still produces the discriminative features employed by the probabilistic neural classiﬁer. Experiments are conducted on a manually developed database of document images of size $64 \times 64$ pixels and on a database of individual words in the three scripts. The results are very encouraging and prove the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Incorporation of speech and Indian scripts can greatly enhance the accessibility of web information among common people. This paper describes a ‘web reader’ which ‘reads out’ the textual contents of a selected web page in Hindi or in English with Indian accent. The content of the page is downloaded and parsed into suitable textual form. It is then passed on to an indigenously developed text-to-speech system for Hindi/Indian English, to generate spoken output. The text-to-speech conversion is performed in three stages: text analysis, to establish pronunciation, phoneme to acoustic$–$phonetic parameter conversion and, lastly, parameter-to-speech conversion through a production model. Different types of voices are used to read special messages. The web reader detects the hypertext links in the web pages and gives the user the option to follow the link or continue perusing the current web page. The user can exercise the option either through a keyboard or via spoken commands. Future plans include reﬁning the web parser, improvement of naturalness of synthetic speech and improving the robustness of the speech recognition system.</p>

				<title>Efﬁcient algorithms for approximate time separation of events</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0129-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Finding bounds on time separation of events is a fundamental problem in the veriﬁcation and analysis of asynchronous and concurrent systems. Unfortunately, even for systems without repeated events or choice, computing exact bounds on time separation of events is an intractable problem when both min and max type timing constraints are present. In this paper, we describe a method for approximating min and max type constraints, and develop a polynomial-time algorithm for computing approximate time separation bounds in choice-free systems without repeated events. Next, we develop a pseudo-polynomial time technique for analysing a class of asynchronous systems in which events repeat over time. Unlike earlier works, our algorithms can analyse systems with both min and max type timing constraints efﬁciently. Although the computed bounds are conservative in the worst-case, experimental results indicate that they are fairly accurate in practice. We present formal proofs of correctness of our algorithms, and demonstrate their efﬁciency and accuracy by applying them to a suite of benchmarks. A complete asynchronous chip has been modelled and analysed using the proposed technique, revealing potential timing problems (already known to designers) in the datapath design.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Very often timing veriﬁcation involves the analysis of the timings of discrete events such as signal changes, sending and receiving of signals, and sensitization of edge-triggered circuit components. The main bottleneck in verifying timing properties of timed ﬁnite state machines (FSM) has been the inherent complexity of verifying timed properties (PSPACE-complete for timed extensions of computational tree logic (CTL)). Often however, we are interested in the best case or worst case timings between events. In this paper we introduce a temporal query language called Min-max Event-Triggered Computational Tree Logic for expressing such extremal queries on the timings of events and show that such queries can be evaluated in time polynomial in the size of the system times the length of the formula.</p>

					<p>We identify a subclass of timed automata called product interval automata and develop its theory. These automata consist of a network of timed agents with the key restriction being that there is just one clock for each agent and the way the clocks are read and reset is determined by the distribution of shared actions across the agents. We show that the resulting automata admit a clean theory in both logical and language theoretic terms. We also show that product interval automata are expressive enough to model the timed behaviour of asynchronous digital circuits.</p>

				<title>Distributed automata in an assumption-commitment framework</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0209-0250</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We propose a class of ﬁnite state systems of synchronizing distributed processes, where processes make assumptions at local states about the state of other processes in the system. This constrains the global states of the system to those where assumptions made by a process about another are compatible with the commitments offered by the other at that state. We model examples like reliable bit transmission and sequence transmission protocols in this framework and discuss how assumption-commitment structure facilitates compositional design of such protocols. We prove a decomposition theorem which states that every protocol speciﬁed globally as a ﬁnite state system can be decomposed into such an assumption compatible system. We also present a syntactic characterization of this class using top level parallel composition.</p>

				<title>Towards simulation of elasto-plastic deformation: An investigation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0251-0294</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Can the deformation of a solid body during plastic ﬂow be assumed to be similar to that of ﬂuids? Here we investigate the possibility of using a modiﬁed Navier$–$Stokes equation as the governing differential equation by including elastic resistance. We adopt the microscopic point of view to explain the material behaviour by laying special emphasis on strain localisation and tension instabilities. A spring and damper model is constructed to obtain approximate simulation of the material behaviour. Based upon the understanding developed from simulating simple tests, we re-formulate the ﬁeld equation using resistances to change in volume and shape. The new ﬁeld equation reduces to the Navier$–$Stokes equation in the ﬂuid limit and Cauchy’s equation in the solid limit. The viscosity and second viscosity of ﬂuids are clearly deﬁned. Bulk and shear modulii and solid damping determine the solid behaviour. Pressure disappears from the ﬁeld equation and so there is no need to invoke the continuity equation. The four material parameters are determinable from simple measurments. This paper tries to capture the various steps of the investigation which lead to the ﬁnal result.</p>

				<title>On using peak amplitude and rise time for AE source characterization</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0295-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Acoustic Emission (AE) signals, which are electrical version of acoustic emissions, are usually analysed using a set of signal parameters. The major objective of signal analysis is to study the characteristics of the sources of emissions. Peak amplitude $(P_a)$ and rise time $(R_t)$ are two such parameters used for source characterization. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the efﬁciency of $P_a$ and $R_t$ to classify and characterize AE sources by modelling the input stress pulse and transducer. Analytical expressions obtained for $P_a$ and $R_t$ clearly indicate their use and efﬁciency for source characterization. It is believed that these results may be of use to investigators in areas like control systems and signal processing also.</p>

				<page>0353-0363</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, two methods are presented to analyse the free overfall in $\Delta$-shaped (equilateral triangle-shaped) channels. First, the ﬂow upstream of a free overfall from smooth horizontal or mildly sloping $\Delta$-shaped channels is analysed theoretically to determine the end-depth-ratio (EDR), applying the momentum equation based on the Boussinesq approximation. Second, an alternate method for analysing free overfall in $\Delta$-shaped channels is also presented where the ﬂow over a free overfall in a $\Delta$-shaped channel is simulated by that over a sharp-crested weir to calculate the EDR. The method of estimation of discharge from the known end depth is also presented for both the methods. These approaches eliminate the need of an experimentally determined pressure coefﬁcient. Experiments are conducted to verify the results obtained from the present methods. Comparisons of the computed and experimental results are satisfactory.</p>

					<p>Fluid-bed drying of vegetable pieces has been investigated. The vegetables used have been potatoes, parsley roots, celery roots and carrots of various dimensions. Starting water content was: potatoes 78%, parsley roots 85.1%, celery roots 93.6%, and carrots 88.6%. Temperatures of ﬂuidisation have varied from $60^\circ $ to $100^\circ C$ at velocities of $0.71 ms^{−1}$. The goal has been to obtain dry vegetables with 6% to 10% water content and of good rehydration quality. Experimental data (bed height, gas temperature and velocity, pressure drop over the bed, drying time) have been measured and relevant values have been calculated. The results have shown that drying of vegetables in a ﬂuidized bed produces dry vegetable pieces of excellent quality in a much shorter time than in continuous belt-dryers which are generally used.</p>

					<p>This paper investigates the combustion knock characteristics of diesel engines running on natural gas using pilot injection as means of initiating combustion. The diesel engines knock under normal operating conditions but the knock referred to in this paper is an objectionable one. In the dual-fuel combustion process we have the ignition stage followed by the combustion stage. There are three types of knock: diesel knock, spark knock and knock due to secondary ignition delay of the primary fuel (erratic knock). Several factors have been noted to feature in deﬁning knock characteristics of dual-fuel engines that include ignition delay, pilot quantity, engine load and speed, turbulence and gas ﬂow rate.</p>

				<title>An experimental method for ripple minimization in transmission data for industrial X-ray computed tomography imaging system</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0393-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Industrial Computed Tomographic (ICT) imaging systems based on X-rays require a high stability source. This emanates from the fact that in a computed tomographic imaging system, statistical variation inherent in the penetrating radiation used to probe the specimen, electronic noise generated in the detection system and reconstruction errors play an important role in the overall quality of the image. A conventional industrial X-ray machine used for routine radiography work is not suitable for tomographic imaging applications because of its output dose variations. In this paper, an experiment is described to utilise a general-purpose $160 kV$ constant potential industrial X-ray machine with signiﬁcant ripple in its output beam, in an experimental Computed Industrial Tomographic Imaging System (CITIS) developed at Isotope Applications Division of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. Studies carried out include the analysis of temporal proﬁle of X-ray beam intensity and online averaging of detected signals for the minimization of periodic ripple, which mainly showed up, at the power line frequency. A tomographic image of a typical specimen, reconstructed with the processed projection data is analysed. It was observed that the mean value of reconstructed linear absorption coefﬁcients and standard deviation computed over a window within a constant density region of the object were stable.</p>

					<p>In the paper under discussion, the problem of surface waves in ﬁbrereinforced anisotropic elastic media has been studied. The authors express the plane strain displacement components in terms of two scalar potentials to decouple the plane motion into $P$ and $SV$ waves. In the present note, we show that, for wave propagation in ﬁbre-reinforced anisotropic media, this decoupling cannot be achieved by the introduction of the displacement potentials. In fact, the expressions for the displacement potentials used by the authors do not satisfy one of the equations of motion. Consequently, most of the equations and results of the subject paper are either irrelevant or incorrect.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0413-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The crack path through composite materials such as concrete depends on the mechanical interaction of inclusions with the cement-based matrix. Fracture energy depends on the deviations of a real crack from an idealized crack plane. Fracture energy and strain softening of normal, high strength, and self-compacting concrete have been determined by means of the wedge splitting test. In applying the numerical model called “numerical concrete” crack formation in normal and high strength concrete is simulated. Characteristic differences of the fracture process can be outlined. Finally results obtained are applied to predict shrinkage cracking under different boundary conditions. Crack formation of high strength concrete has to be seriously controlled in order to achieve the necessary durability of concrete structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of scale-effects on the performances of concrete structures is discussed. Experimentally observed decrease of nominal tensile strength, accompanied by structural embrittlement, occurring in large structures is of crucial importance in modern concrete engineering. Most of the previous approaches to the problem are restricted to notched structures and they often fail to predict mechanical behaviour in real situations. The physical approach put forward by us takes into adequate account the effects of microstructural disorder and seems to be valid in the whole size range, at least for unnotched structures. Thereby, reliable predictions can be made of the material properties in large-sized concrete structures.</p>

				<title>Application of size effect to compressive strength of concrete members</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0467-0484</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is important to consider the effect of size when estimating the ultimate strength of a concrete member under various loading conditions. Well known as the size effect, the strength of a member tends to decrease when its size increases. Therefore, in view of recent increased interest in the size effect of concrete this research focuses on the size effect of two main classes of compressive strength of concrete: pure axial compressive strength and ﬂexural compressive strength.</p>
					<p>First, fracture mechanics type size effect on the compressive strength of cylindrical concrete specimens was studied, with the diameter, and the height/diameter ratio considered as the main parameters. Theoretical and statistical analyses were conducted, and a size effect equation was proposed to predict the compressive strength specimens. The proposed equation showed good agreement with the existing test results for concrete cylinders.</p>
					<p>Second, the size, length, and depth variations of a ﬂexural compressive member have been studied experimentally. A series of $C$-shaped specimens subjected to axial compressive load and bending moment were tested. The shape of specimens and the test procedures used were similar to those by Hognestad and others. The test results are curve-ﬁtted using Levenberg$–$Marquardt’s least squares method (LSM) to obtain parameters for the modiﬁed size effect law (MSEL) by Kim and co workers. The results of the analysis show that the effect of specimen size, length, and depth on ultimate strength is signiﬁcant. Finally, more general parameters for MSEL are suggested.</p>

				<title>Analysis of delayed convergence in the three-noded Timoshenko beam element using the function space approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0507-0526</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Despite satisfying only completeness and continuity requirements, elements often perform erroneously in a certain class of problems, called the locking situations, where they display spurious stress oscillations and enhanced stiffness properties. The function space approach that effectively substantiates the postulates of the ﬁeld consistency paradigm is an efﬁcient tool to reveal the fundamental cause of locking phenomena, and propose methods to eliminate this pathological problem. In this paper, we review the delayed convergence behaviour of three-noded Timoshenko beam elements using the rigorous function space approach. Explicit, closed form algebraic results for the element strains, stresses and errors have been derived using this method. The performance of the ﬁeld-inconsistent three-noded Timoshenko beam element is compared with that of the ﬁeld-inconsistent twonoded beam element. It is demonstrated that while the ﬁeld-inconsistent two-noded linear element is prone to shear locking, the ﬁeld-inconsistent three-noded element is not very vulnerable to this pathological problem, despite the resulting shear oscillations.</p>

				<title>Development of fuels and structural materials for fast breeder reactors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0527-0558</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fast breeder reactors (FBRs) are destined to play a crucial role inthe Indian nuclear power programme in the foreseeable future. FBR technology involves a multi-disciplinary approach to solve the various challenges in the areas of fuel and materials development. Fuels for FBRs have signiﬁcantly higher concentration of ﬁssile material than in thermal reactors, with a matching increase in burn-up. The design of the fuel is an important aspect which has to be optimised for efﬁcient, economic and safe production of power. FBR components operate under hostile and demanding environment of high neutron ﬂux, liquid sodium coolant and elevated temperatures. Resistance to void swelling, irradiation creep, and irradiation embrittlement are therefore major considerations in the choice of materials for the core components. Structural and steam generator materials should have good resistance to creep, low cycle fatigue, creep-fatigue interaction and sodium corrosion.</p>
					<p>The development of carbide fuel and structural materials for the Fast Breeder Test Reactor at Kalpakkam was a great technological challenge. At the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), advanced research facilities have been established, and extensive studies have been carried out in the areas of fuel and materials development. This has laid the foundation for the design and development of a 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor. Highlights of some of these studies are discussed in this paper in the context of our mission to develop and deploy FBR technology for the energy security of India in the $21^{st}$ century.</p>

Experiments were carried out in a ﬂume with various sizes of gravel and coal samples. The critical bed shear stresses for the experimental runs determined using side-wall correction show considerable disagreement with the standard curves. The characteristic parameters affecting the incipient motion of particles in rough-turbulent regime, identiﬁed based on physical reasoning and dimensional analysis, are the Shields parameter, particle Froude number, non-dimensional particle diameter and non-dimensional ﬂow depth. Equations of critical bed shear stress for the initial movement of gravel and coal beds were obtained using experimental data.

				<title>Two-tier architecture for unconstrained handwritten character recognition</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0585-0594</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we propose an approach that combines the unsupervised and supervised learning techniques for unconstrained handwritten numeral recognition. This approach uses the Kohonen self-organizing neural network for data classiﬁcation in the ﬁrst stage and the learning vector quantization (LVQ) model in the second stage to improve classiﬁcation accuracy. The combined architecture performs better than the Kohonen self-organizing map alone. In the proposed approach, the collection of centroids at different phases of training plays a vital role in the performance of the recognition system. Four experiments have been conducted and experimental results show that the collection of centroids in the middle of the training gives high performance in terms of speed and accuracy. The systems developed also resolve the confusion between handwritten numerals.</p>

				<page>0595-0604</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present context, we consider the propagation of shear waves in the transverse isotropic ﬂuid saturated porous plate. The frequency spectrum for SH-modes in the plate has been studied. It is observed that the frequency of the propagation is damped due to the two-phase character of the porous medium. The dimensionless phase velocities of the shear waves have also been calculated and presented graphically. It is interesting to note that the frequency and phase velocity of shear waves in porous media differ signiﬁcantly in comparison to that in isotropic elastic media.</p>

				<title>Experimental and ﬁnite element analysis of fracture criterion in general yielding fracture mechanics</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0631-0642</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Efforts made over the last three decades to understand the fracture behaviour of structural materials in elastic and elasto-plastic fracture mechanics are numerous, whereas investigations related to fracture behaviour of materials in thin sheets or general yielding fracture regimes are limited in number. Engineering simulative tests are being used to characterize formability and drawability of sheet metals. However, these tests do not assure consistency in quality of sheet metal products. The prevention of failure in stressed structural components currently requires fracture mechanics based design parameters like critical load, critical crack-tip opening displacement or fracture toughness. The present attempt would aim to fulﬁll this gap and generate more information thereby increased understanding on fracture behaviour of sheet metals. In the present investigation, using a recently developed technique for determining fracture criteria in sheet metals, results are generated on critical CTOD and fracture toughness. Finite element analysis was performed to support the results on various fracture parameters. The differences are within 1 to 4%. At the end it is concluded that magnitude of critical CTOD and/or critical load can be used as a fracture criterion for thin sheets.</p>

				<title>Computation of ﬂow and thermal ﬁelds in a model CVD reactor</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0657-0673</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mixing of coaxial jets within a tube in the presence of blockage has been numerically studied. This conﬁguration is encountered during the modelling of ﬂow and heat transfer in CVD (chemical vapour deposition) reactors. For the conditions prevailing in the reactor, the Reynolds numbers are low and ﬂow can be taken to be laminar and incompressible. The unsteady forms of the governing equations have been solved by a ﬁnite volume method that can treat complex three-dimensional geometries. The algorithm is a two-step procedure, wherein the ﬁrst step predicts the velocity ﬁeld using an assumed pressure ﬁeld. The second step corrects the ﬁelds using a Poisson equation to obtain the pressure corrections. Advection terms have been treated by a hybrid upwind-central difference technique. The computer code developed is fully three-dimensional, though most computations of the present study have been carried out for two-dimensional geometry. Results have been obtained in the form of velocity vector plots, wall shear stress variation on the block and the tube wall, isotherms and temperature proﬁles. The ﬂow and heat transfer characteristics of jet mixing have been explored in terms of the Reynolds number, the jet velocity ratio, the axial position of the block, and the blockage ratio. The results obtained show that a proper combination of the process parameters can lead to an improved performance of the CVD reactor.</p>

				<title>Dimensionality reduction in conic section function neural network</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0675-0683</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper details how dimensionality can be reduced in conic section function neural networks (CSFNN). This is particularly important for hardware implementation of networks. One of the main problems to be solved when considering the hardware design is the high connectivity requirement. If the effect that each of the network inputs has on the network output after training a neural network is known, then some inputs can be removed from the network. Consequently, the dimensionality of the network, and hence, the connectivity and the training time can be reduced. Sensitivity analysis, which extracts the cause and effect relationship between the inputs and outputs of the network, has been proposed as a method to achieve this and is investigated for Iris plant, thyroid disease and ionosphere databases. Simulations demonstrate the validity of the method used.</p>

				<title>A knowledge-based approach for recognition of handwritten Pitman shorthand language strokes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0685-0698</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Pitman shorthand language (PSL) is a recording medium practised in all organizations, where English is the transaction medium. It has the practical advantage of high speed of recording, more than 120$–$200 words per minute, because of which it is universally acknowledged. This recording medium has its continued existence in spite of considerable developments in speech processing systems, which are not universally established yet. In order to exploit the vast transcribing potential of PSL a new area of research on automation of PSL processing is conceived. It has three major steps, namely, shape recognition of PSL strokes, their validation and English text production from these strokes.</p>
					<p>The paper describes a knowledge-based approach for the recognition of PSL strokes. Information about location and the direction of the starting point and ﬁnal point of strokes are considered the knowledge base for recognition of strokes. The work comprises preprocessing, determination of starting and ﬁnal points, acquisition of quadrant knowledge, graph-based traversal and ﬁnally a rule-based inference process for generating phonetic equivalent of English language characters for the strokes. The proposed work is thoroughly tested for a large number of handwritten strokes.</p>

				<title>Modelling and control of broadband trafﬁc using multiplicative multifractal cascades</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0699-0723</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results on the modelling and synthesis of broadband trafﬁc processes namely ethernet inter-arrival times using the VVGM (variable variance gaussian multiplier) multiplicative multifractal model. This model is shown to be more appropriate for modelling network trafﬁc which possess time varying scaling/self-similarity and burstiness. The model gives a simple and efﬁcient technique to synthesise Ethernet inter-arrival times. The results of the detailed statistical and multifractal analysis performed on the original and the synthesised traces are presented and the performance is compared with other models in the literature, such as the Poisson process, and the Multifractal Wavelet Model (MWM) process. It is also shown empirically that a single server queue preserves the multifractal character of the process by analysing its inter-departure process when fed with the multifractal traces. The result of the existence of a global-scaling exponent for multifractal cascades and its application in queueing theory are discussed. We propose tracking and control algorithms for controlling network congestion with bursty trafﬁc modelled by multifractal cascade processes, characterised by the Holder exponents, the value of which at an interval indicates the burstiness in the trafﬁc at that point. This value has to be estimated and used for the estimation of the congestion and predictive control of the trafﬁc in broadband networks. The estimation can be done by employing wavelet transforms and a Kalman ﬁlter based predictor for predicting the burstiness of the trafﬁc.</p>

				<title>Structure and thermal stability of nanocrystalline materials</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0023-0045</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nanocrystalline materials, which are expected to play a key role in the next generation of human civilization, are assembled with nanometre-sized “building blocks” consisting of the crystalline and large volume fractions of intercrystalline components. In order to predict the unique properties of nanocrystalline materials, which are a combination of the properties of the crystalline and intercrystalline regions, it is essential to understand precisely how the structures of crystalline and intercrystalline regions vary with decrease in crystallite size. In addition, study of the thermal stability of nanocrystalline materials against signiﬁcant grain growth is both scientiﬁc and technological interest. A sharp increase in grain size (to micron levels) during consolidation of nanocrystalline powders to obtain fully dense materials may consequently result in the loss of some unique properties of nanocrystalline materials. Therefore, extensive interest has been generated in exploring the size effects on the structure of crystalline and intercrystalline region of nanocrystalline materials, and the thermal stability of nanocrystalline materials against signiﬁcant grain growth. The present article is aimed at understanding the structure and stability of nanocrystalline materials.</p>

					<p>Structures of grain boundaries and triple line junctions in nanocrystalline materials are of interest owing to large fractions of atoms in nanocrystalline materials being at these interfacial positions. Grain boundary and triple line junction structures in nanocrystalline palladium have been studied using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The main microstructural features observed include the varying atomic structures of grain boundaries and the presence of disordered regions at triple line junctions. Also, there is variation in lattice parameters in different nanocrystalline grains. Geometric phase analysis is used to quantify atomic displacements within nanocrystalline grains. Displacement ﬁelds thus detected indicate links to the interface structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nanomaterials are playing an increasingly important role in modern technologies. Interfaces are crucial in nanotechnology. In this study, we have examined the stability of nanoparticles. Major emphasis is on understanding the effect of interfaces on melting. Melting behaviour of nanocrystalline interfaces, created by embedding lead and bismuth nanoparticles in quasicrystalline matrices, was studied. Sharply faceted and coherent interfaces can be related to sharper melting transitions, while irregularly shaped and incoherent interfaces can be directly correlated with lowering of melting temperatures. It is shown here that solid lead forms a high energy interface with phason strain-free quasicrystal (resulting in a lowering of the melting temperature) while bismuth forms a low energy interface with the quasicrystal (resulting in superheating, unusual for bismuth).</p>

				<title>Thermally assisted deformation of structural superplastics and nanostructured materials: A personal perspective</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optimal structural superplasticity and the deformation of nanostructured materials in the thermally activated region are regarded as being caused by the same physical process. In this analysis, grain/interphase boundary sliding controls the rate of deformation at the level of atomistics. Boundary sliding develops to a mesoscopic level by plane interface formation involving two or more boundaries and at this stage the rate controlling step is boundary migration. In other words, grain/interphase boundary sliding is viewed as a two-scale process. The non-zero, unbalanced shear stresses present at the grain/interphase boundaries ensure that near-random grain rotation is also a non-rate controlling concomitant of this mechanism. Expressions have been derived for the free energy of activation for the atomic scale rate controlling process, the threshold stress that should be crossed for the commencement of mesoscopic boundary sliding, the inverse Hall$–$Petch effect and the steady state rate equation connecting the strain rate to the independent variables of stress, temperature and grain size. Beyond the point of inﬂection in the log stress$–$log strain rate plot, climb controlled multiple dislocation motion within the grains becomes increasingly important and at sufﬁciently high stresses becomes rate controlling. The predictions have been validated experimentally.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Currently nickel-base single crystal $(SX)$ superalloys are considered for the manufacture of critical components such as turbine blades, vanes etc., for aircraft engines as well as land-based power generation applications. Microstructure and high temperature mechanical properties are the major factors controlling the performance of $SX$ superalloys. Rafting is an important phenomenon in these alloys which occurs during high temperature creep. It is essential to understand the rafting mechanism, and its characteristics on high temperature properties before considering the advanced applications. In this review article, the thermodynamic driving force for rafting with and without stress is explained. The nature and inﬂuence of rafting on creep properties including pre-rafted conditions are discussed. In addition, the effect of stress state on $\gamma /\gamma'$ rafting, kinetics and morphological evolution are discussed with the recent experimental results.</p>

				<title>Dynamics of micromechanisms controlling the mechanical behaviour of industrial single crystal superalloys</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0129-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>When deforming bulk material, micromechanisms involving moving defects result in mechanical characteristics observed at a macroscopic scale. In situ straining of microsamples in a Transmission Electron Microscope. provides the unique advantage of observing the dislocation dynamics involved in such microdeformation processes under the combined effects of stress and temperature. Here the efﬁciency of this technique is illustrated by describing the different obstacles controlling the movement of dislocations in a two-phase industrial single crystal superalloy. At $25^\circ $ and $850^\circ C$, different core structures of the moving dislocations as well as several ways of crossing obstacles are described, which concern the movement of dislocations in $\gamma$ channels, at $\gamma /\gamma' $ interfaces and while shearing $\gamma' $ precipitates. From these observations, a quantitative analysis is developed leading to the evaluation of the critical propagation stresses involved in the channels of the matrix and when crossing the interfaces. This allows to discuss the various sites of resistance opposed to the dislocation movements and controlling the macroscopic deformation.</p>

				<title>Thermomechanical fatigue $–$ Damage mechanisms and mechanism-based life prediction methods</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0147-0165</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An existing extensive database on the isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue behaviour of high-temperature titanium alloy $IMI 834$ and dispersoidstrengthened aluminum alloy $X8019$ in $SiC$ particle-reinforced as well as unreinforced conditions was used to evaluate both the adaptability of fracture mechanics approaches to TMF and the resulting predictive capabilities of determining material life by crack propagation consideration. Selection of the correct microstructural concepts was emphasised and these concepts were, then adjusted by using data from independent experiments in order to avoid any sort of ﬁtting. It is shown that the cyclic $J$ -integral ($\Delta J_{eff}$ concept) is suitable to predict the cyclic lifetime for conditions where the total crack propagation rate is approximately identical to pure fatigue crack growth velocity. In the case that crack propagation is strongly affected by creep, the creep$–$fatigue damage parameter $\Delta_{C F}$ introduced by Riedel can be successfully applied. If environmental effects are very pronounced, the accelerating inﬂuence of corrosion on fatigue crack propagation can no longer implicitly be taken into account in the fatigue crack growth law. Instead, a linear combination of the crack growth rate contributions from plain fatigue (determined in vacuum) and from environmental attack is assumed and found to yield a satisfactory prediction, if the relevant corrosion process is taken into account.</p>

				<title>Ductile fracture behaviour of primary heat transport piping material of nuclear reactors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0167-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Design of primary heat transport (PHT) piping of pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWR) has to ensure implementation of leak-before-break concepts. In order to be able to do so, the ductile fracture characteristics of PHT piping material have to be quantiﬁed. In this paper, the fracture resistance of SA333, Grade 6 steel $–$ the material used for Indian PHWR $–$ under monotonic and cyclic tearing loading has been documented. An attempt has also been made to understand the mechanism responsible for the high fracture toughness of the steel through determination of the effect of constraint on the fracture behaviour and fractographic observations.</p>
					<p>From $J–R$ tests over a range of temperatures, it was observed that SA333 steel exhibits embrittlement tendencies in the service temperature regime. The fracture resistance of the steel is inferior in the longitudinal direction with respect to the pipe geometry as compared to that in the circumferential direction. Imposition of cyclic unloading during ductile fracture tests for simulation of response to seismic activities results in a dramatic decrease of fracture resistance. It appears, from the observations of effects of constraint on fracture toughness and fractographic examinations, that fracture resistance of the steel is derived partly from the inability of voids to initiate and grow due to a loss of constraint in the crack-tip stress ﬁeld.</p>

				<title>Cyclic deformation behaviour of austenitic steels at ambient and elevated temperatures</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0187-0208</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of the present investigation is to characterise cyclic deformation behaviour and plasticity-induced martensite formation of metastable austenitic stainless steels at ambient and elevated temperatures, taking into account the inﬂuence of the alloying elements titanium and niobium. Titanium and niobium are ferrite-stabilising elements which inﬂuence the ferrite crystallisation. Furthermore, They form carbides and/or carbonitrides and thus limit the austenite-stabilising effect of carbon and nitrogen. Several specimen batches of titanium and niobium alloyed austenite and of a pure $Cr-Ni$-steel for comparison were tested under stress and total strain control at a frequency of $5 Hz$ and triangular load-time waveforms. Stress$–$strain-hysteresis and temperature measurements were used at ambient temperature to characterise cyclic deformation behaviour. Plasticity-induced martensite content was detected with non-destructive magnetic measuring techniques. The experiments yield characteristic cyclic deformation curves and corresponding magnetic signals according to the actual fatigue state and the amount of martensite. Fatigue behaviour of $X6CrNiTi1810 (AISI 321), X10CrNiCb189 (AISI 348)$ and $X5CrNi1810 (AISI 304)$ is characterised by cyclic hardening and softening effects which are strongly inﬂuenced by speciﬁc loading conditions. Martensite formation varies with the composition, loading conditions, temperature and number of cycles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Aluminium$–$lithium alloys hold promise of providing a breakthrough response to the crying need for lightweight alloys for use as structurals in aerospace applications. Considerable worldwide research has gone into developing a range of these alloys over the last three decades. As a result, substantial understanding has been developed of the microstructure-based micromechanisms of strengthening, of fatigue and fracture as well as of anisotropy in mechanical properties. However, these alloys have not yet greatly displaced the conventionally used denser Al alloys on account of their poorer ductility, fracture toughness and low cycle fatigue resistance. This review aims to summarise the work pertaining to study of structure and mechanical properties with a view to indicate the directions that have been and can be pursued to overcome property limitations.</p>

				<page>0263-0272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Following a brief overview, results of our investigations on phonon modes in $MgB_2$ , and superconducting transition in carbon doped $MgB_2$ are presented. The superconducting transition temperature in $MgB_{2−x}C_x$ as obtained from susceptibility and resistivity measurements is observed to decrease systematically from $39.4 K$ for $x = 0$ to $26 K$ for $x = 0.5$S. It is shown the changes in lattice volume, as obtained from x-ray diffraction measurements, can account only partially for the observed decrease in $T_c$. The observed variation of $T_c$ with carbon content is seen to correlate with the Debye temperatures, obtained from an analysis of the resistivity data.</p>
					<p>Investigation of the phonon modes in $MgB_2$ , through infrared absorption measurements indicate three modes at 410, 475 and $560 cm^{−1}$ The former two are associated with the infrared active modes, and the third component is associated with the Raman mode, that gets activated due to disorder. A study of the temperature dependence of these modes indicates no changes across the superconducting transition. The mode at $560 cm^{−1}$ shows a signiﬁcant hardening and a corresponding decrease in linewidth, with the lowering of temperature, that can been accounted in terms of anharmonicity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Magnetic properties of materials in their nanocrystalline state have assumed signiﬁcance in recent years because of their potential applications. A number of techniques have been used to prepare nanocrystalline magnetic phases. Melt spinning, high energy ball milling, sputtering, glassceramization and molecular beam epitaxy are some of the physical methods used so far. Among the chemical methods, sol$–$gel and co-precipitation routes have been found to be convenient. Ultraﬁne particles of both ferro- and ferrimagnetic systems show superparamagnetic behaviour at room temperature. Coercivity $(H_c)$ and maximum energy product $(BH)_{max}$ of the magnetic particles can be changed by controlling their sizes. The present paper reviews all these aspects in the case of nanocrystalline magnetic systems $–$ both metallic and ceramics.</p>

					<p>Development of micro-MIM/-CIM was started at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe with the aim of creating a process suitable for a wide range of materials as well as for medium-scale and large-scale production of micro components. Using enhanced machine technology and special tempering procedures, this process enables the manufacturing of metal and ceramic devices with smallest wall thicknesses of $50 \mu m$ and structural details of less than $3 \mu m$. Using ultra-ﬁne ceramic powders (e.g. zirconia) and high-quality LIGA mould inserts, surface qualities of $R_a = 40 nm$ or $R_{max} \leq 3 mm$ could be obtained. Possible practical applications are demonstrated by components of micro-annular gear pumps made of zirconia for future handling of very small volumes of dangerous ﬂuids and micro samples (tensile and bending specimens) suitable for mechanical testing of metals $(316L, 17-4PH)$ and ceramic materials $(Al_2O_3, ZrO_2)$ in the micrometre range.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0307-0318</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fabrication of micropatterned ceramics or ceramic microparts make high demands on the precision and resolution of the moulding process. As ﬁnishing of miniaturised or micropatterned ceramic components is nearly impossible, shaping has to be done by a replication step in the green, unﬁred state. To avoid high tooling costs in product development, a rapid prototyping process chain has been established that enables rapid manufacturing of ceramic microcomponents from functional models to small lot series within a short time. This process chain combines the fast and inexpensive supply of master models by rapid prototyping with accurate and ﬂexible ceramic manufacturing by low-pressure injection moulding. Besides proper feedstock preparation and sufﬁcient small grain size, the quality of the ﬁnal components is mainly inﬂuenced by the quality of the master model. Hence, the rapid prototyping method must be carefully selected to meet the requirements of the component to be fabricated.</p>

				<title>Aluminium matrix composites: Challenges and opportunities</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0319-0334</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aluminium matrix composites (AMCs) refer to the class of light weight high performance aluminium centric material systems. The reinforcement in AMCs could be in the form of continuous/discontinuous ﬁbres, whisker or particulates, in volume fractions ranging from a few percent to 70%. Properties of AMCs can be tailored to the demands of different industrial applications by suitable combinations of matrix, reinforcement and processing route. Presently several grades of AMCs are manufactured by different routes. Three decades of intensive research have provided a wealth of new scientiﬁc knowledge on the intrinsic and extrinsic effects of ceramic reinforcement vis-a-vis physical, mechanical, thermo-mechanical and tribological properties of AMCs. In the last few years, AMCs have been utilised in high-tech structural and functional applications including aerospace, defence, automotive, and thermal management areas, as well as in sports and recreation. It is interesting to note that research on particle-reinforced cast AMCs took root in India during the 70’s, attained industrial maturity in the developed world and is currently in the process of joining the mainstream of materials. This paper presents an overview of AMC material systems on aspects relating to processing, microstructure, properties and applications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Carbon in dense as well as porous solid form is used in a variety of applications. Activated porous carbons are made through pyrolysis and activation of carbonaceous natural as well as synthetic precursors. Pyrolysed woods replicate the structure of original wood but as such possess very low surface areas and poor adsorption capacities. On activation, these exhibit increased adsorption volumes of $0.5–0.8 cm^3 /gm$ and surface areas of $700–1800 m^2 /gm$ depending on activation conditions, whether physical or chemical. Former carbons possess mixed pore size distribution while chemically activated carbons predominantly possess micropores. Thus, these carbons can be used for adsorption of wide distributions of molecules from gas to liquid. The molecular adsorption within the pores is due to single layer or multilayer molecule deposition at the pore walls and hence results in different types of adsorption isotherm. On the other hand, activated carbon ﬁbres with controlled microporous structure and surface area in the range of $2500 m^2 /gm$ can be developed by controlled pyrolysis and physical activation of amorphous carbon ﬁbres. Active carbon ﬁbres with unmatchable pore structure and surface characteristics are present and futuristic porous materials for a number of applications from pollution control to energy storage.</p>

					<p>Carbon$–$carbon composites rank ﬁrst among ceramic composite materials with a spectrum of properties and applications in various sectors. These composites are made of ﬁbres in various directions and carbonaceous polymers and hydrocarbons as matrix precursors. Their density and properties depend on the type and volume fraction of reinforcement, matrix precursor used and end heat treatment temperature. Composites made with thermosetting resins as matrix precursors possess low densities $(1.55–1.75 g/cm^3)$ and well-distributed microporosity whereas those made with pitch as the matrix precursor, after densiﬁcation exhibit densities of $1.8–2.0 g/cm^3$ with some mesopores, and those made by the CVD technique with hydrocarbon gases, possess intermediate densities and matrices with close porosities. The former (resin-based) composites exhibit high ﬂexural strength, low toughness and low thermal conductivity, whereas the latter (pitch- and CVD-based) can be made with very high thermal conductivity $(400–700 W/MK)$ in the ﬁbre direction. Carbon$–$carbon composites are used in a variety of sectors requiring high mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, good frictional properties for brake pads in high speed vehicles or high thermal conductivity for thermal management applications. However, for extended life applications, these composites need to be protected against oxidation either through matrix modiﬁcation with $Si$, $Zr$, $Hf$ etc. or by multilayer oxidation protection coatings consisting of $SiC$, silica, zircon etc.</p>

				<title>Solidiﬁcation cracking in austenitic stainless steel welds</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0359-0382</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solidiﬁcation cracking is a signiﬁcant problem during the welding of austenitic stainless steels, particularly in fully austenitic and stabilized compositions. Hot cracking in stainless steel welds is caused by low-melting eutectics containing impurities such as $S, P$ and alloy elements such as $Ti, Nb$. The WRC-92 diagram can be used as a general guide to maintain a desirable solidiﬁcation mode during welding. Nitrogen has complex effects on weld-metal microstructure and cracking. In stabilized stainless steels, $Ti$ and $Nb$ react with $S, N$ and $C$ to form low-melting eutectics. Nitrogen picked up during welding signiﬁcantly enhances cracking, which is reduced by minimizing the ratio of $Ti$ or $Nb$ to that of $C$ and $N$ present. The metallurgical propensity to solidiﬁcation cracking is determined by elemental segregation, which manifests itself as a brittleness temperature range or BTR, that can be determined using the varestraint test. Total crack length (TCL), used extensively in hot cracking assessment, exhibits greater variability due to extraneous factors as compared to BTR. In austenitic stainless steels, segregation plays an overwhelming role in determining cracking susceptibility.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Study of hydrogen-assisted cracking and measurement of diffusible hydrogen content in different $Cr–Mo$ steel welds shows that under identical conditions, susceptibility to cracking increased and diffusible hydrogen content decrease with increase in alloy content. Hydrogen permeation studies show that hydrogen diffusivity decreases and solubility increases with increase in alloy content. Thus decrease in diffusible hydrogen content with increase in alloying is attributed to increase in apparent solubility and decrease in apparent diffusivity of hydrogen. Analysis of the results indicates that variation of diffusible hydrogen content and apparent diffusivity of hydrogen with alloy content can be represented as a function of carbon equivalent $CE_1$ originally proposed to predict the hardness in the heat-affected zone of alloy steel welds.</p>

				<title>Optimisation of post-weld heat treatment $–$ A simple, practical method</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0409-0430</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The authors have evolved an empirical method for characterizing resistance to ductile fracture using two parameters $\Gamma _f$ and $\eta_f$ that can be determined from tensile test data of smooth cylindrical specimens. This method stipulates that the post-necking regime during tensile deformation is dominated by microvoid growth and coalescence processes, and therefore the energy absorbed in this regime can be used to estimate the resistance of the necked region to ductile fracture. The test procedure employed is simple and does not require gauge-length extensometry, a distinct advantage at non-ambient temperatures. The tests are carried out in a screw-driven machine at a constant crosshead speed, with online computerized acquisition of load$–$time data; it is also necessary to have a prior precise calibration for the (nonlinear) elastic deformation of the load train. The method of computing $\Gamma_f$ and $\eta_f$ , from tensile data is described, and its engineering application demonstrated by characterizing the effect of ageing of two dissimilar metal welds, namely Alloy $800/2.25Cr–1Mo$ steel and Alloy $800/9Cr–1Mo$ steel. From these results, it has been established that this procedure of estimating the ductile fracture toughness from tensile tests can be used as a simple, practical method for optimisation of post-weld heat treatment of weld joints.</p>

				<title>Hydrogen embrittlement in power plant steels</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>In power plants, several major components such as steam generator tubes, boilers, steam/water pipe lines, water box of condensers and the other auxiliary components like bolts, nuts, screws fasteners and supporting assemblies are commonly fabricated from plain carbon steels, as well as low and high alloy steels. These components often fail catastrophically due to hydrogen embrittlement. A brief overview of our current understanding of the phenomenon of such hydrogen damage in steels is presented in this paper. Case histories of failures of steel components due to hydrogen embrittlement, which are reported in literature, are brieﬂy discussed. A phenomenological assessment of overall process of hydrogen embrittlement and classiﬁcation of the various damage modes are summarized. Inﬂuence of several physical and metallurgical variables on the susceptibility of steels to hydrogen embrittlement, mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement and current approaches to combat this problem are also presented.</p>

				<title>Effect of hydrogen on mechanical properties of $\beta$-titanium alloys</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0453-0465</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Conﬂicting opinions exist in the literature on the manner in which hydrogen inﬂuences the mechanical properties of $\beta$-titanium alloys. This can be attributed to the $\beta$-stabilizing effect of hydrogen in these materials leading to major changes in the microstructure as a result of hydrogen charging. The resulting (extrinsic) effect of hydrogen on the mechanical properties can possibly cover up the direct (intrinsic) inﬂuences.</p>
					<p>On the basis of experimentally determined thermodynamic and kinetic data regarding the interaction of hydrogen with $\beta$-titanium alloys, hydrogen concentrations of up to 8 at.% were established in three commercial alloys by means of hydrogen charging from the gas phase. In order to separate intrinsic and extrinsic effects the charging was carried out during one step of the two-step heat treatment typical of metastable $\beta$-titanium alloys, while the other step was performed in vacuum.</p>
					<p>The results on the single-phase $\beta$ condition represent the intrinsic hydrogen effect. Monotonic and cyclic strength increase at the expense of ductility with increasing hydrogen concentration. The brittle to ductile transition temperature shifts to higher values and the fatigue crack propagation threshold value decreases. The microstructure of the metastable, usually two-phase $\beta$-titanium alloys is strongly affected by hydrogen, although the extent of this effect depends not only on the hydrogen concentration but also on the temperature of charging. This microstructural inﬂuence (extrinsic effect) changes the mechanical properties in the opposite direction as compared to the intrinsic hydrogen effect.</p>

As a precursor to the topic the paper also reviews the performance of the traditional corrosion-resistant alloys and their weldments and the necessity of using duplex stainless steels (DSS), in order to alleviate corrosion problems in marine environments. Given that the performance of weldments of such steels is often unsatisfactory, this review also assesses the research needs in this area. In this context the paper also discusses the recent reports on the role of microorganisms in inducing hydrogen embrittlements and corrosion fatigue.</p>

				<page>0475-0493</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Since the inception of electroless coating by Brenner &amp; Riddell in 1946, it has been the subject of research interest and, in the past two decades, emphasis has shifted to the studies of its properties and applications. The co-deposition of particulate matter or substance within the growing ﬁlm has led to a new generation of electroless composite coatings, many of which possess excellent wear and corrosion resistance. This valuable process can coat not only electrically conductive materials including graphite but also fabrics, insulators like plastics, rubber etc. The low coating rates with these can provide better reﬂectivity of plated surfaces and many more applications. Coatings can be tailored for desired properties by selecting the composition of the coating alloy/composite/metallic to suit speciﬁc requirements. The market for these coatings is expanding fast as the potential applications are on the rise. In the present article, an attempt has been made to review different electroless alloy/composite coatings with respect to bath types and their composition, properties and applications. Different characterisation studies have been conducted on various electroless nickel-based coatings with emphasis on wear and corrosion properties.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0495-0562</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Light ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission of radiation (laser) is a coherent and monochromatic beam of electromagnetic radiation that can propagate in a straight line with negligible divergence and occur in a wide range of wavelength, energy/power and beam-modes/conﬁgurations. As a result, lasers ﬁnd wide applications in the mundane to the most sophisticated devices, in commercial to purely scientiﬁc purposes, and in life-saving as well as life-threatening causes. In the present contribution, we provide an overview of the application of lasers for material processing. The processes covered are broadly divided into four major categories; namely, laser-assisted forming, joining, machining and surface engineering. Apart from brieﬂy introducing the fundamentals of these operations, we present an updated review of the relevant literature to highlight the recent advances and open questions. We begin our discussion with the general applications of lasers, fundamentals of laser$–$matter interaction and classiﬁcation of laser material processing. A major part of the discussion focuses on laser surface engineering that has attracted a good deal of attention from the scientiﬁc community for its technological signiﬁcance and scientiﬁc challenges. In this regard, a special mention is made about laser surface vitriﬁcation or amorphization that remains a very attractive but unaccomplished proposition.</p>

				<title>Fatigue behaviour of ﬁne-grained alumina hip-joint heads under normal walking conditions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0589-0600</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In prosthetic applications, the reliability of implant materials over a period of thirty years is absolutely essential. Calculation of the lifetimes of alumina ceramic heads is generally made on the basis of experimental fatigue and slow crack growth tests using ﬁnite element analysis. This investigation is aimed at understanding the fatigue behaviour of ﬁne-grained alumina heads of hip joints. The service conditions of cyclic stress experienced by hip joints during walking are used in evaluating the fatigue behaviour of alumina femoral heads. These femoral heads have successfully withstood $10^7$ cycles at a maximum walking stress of $17.2 kN$, which is equivalent to a body weight of $400 kg$. The femoral heads did not exhibit any sub-critical crack growth at the maximum walking load of $10 kN$, indicating the quasi-inﬁnite performance life in patients up to a body weight of $250 kg$. The details of proof testing designed for evaluating the performance of femoral heads over 40 years are also presented.</p>

				<page>0601-0637</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chemical stability, mechanical behaviour and biocompatibility in body ﬂuids and tissues are the basic requirements for successful application of implant materials in bone fractures and replacements. Corrosion is one of the major processes affecting the life and service of orthopaedic devices made of metals and alloys used as implants in the body. Among the metals and alloys known, stainless steels (SS), $Co–Cr$ alloys and titanium and its alloys are the most widely used for the making of biodevices for extended life in human body. Incidences of failure of stainless steel implant devices reveal the occurrence of signiﬁcant localised corroding viz., pitting and crevice corrosion. Titanium forms a stable $TiO_2$ ﬁlm which can release titanium particles under wear into the body environment. To reduce corrosion and achieve better biocompatibility, bulk alloying of stainless steels with titanium and nitrogen, surface alloying by ion implantation of stainless steels and titanium and its alloys, and surface modiﬁcation of stainless steel with bioceramic coatings are considered potential methods for improving the performance of orthopaedic devices. This review discusses these issues in depth and examines emerging directions.</p>

				<title>Toughening and creep in multiphase intermetallics through microstructural control</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0677-0693</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The lack of engineering ductility in intermetallics has limited their structural applications, in spite of their attractive speciﬁc properties at high temperatures. Over the last decade, research in intermetallics has been stimulated by the discovery of remarkable ductilisation mechanisms in these materials. It has however often been the case that the process of ductilisation or toughening has also led to a decrease in high temperature properties, especially creep. In this paper we describe approaches to the ductilisation of two different classes of intermetallic alloys through alloying to introduce beneﬁcial, second phase effects. The $Ti_2AlNb$ based intermetallics in the $Ti–Al–Nb$ system can be ductilised by stabilising the bcc phase of titanium into the structure. The principles of microstructural and compositional optimization developed to achieve adequate plasticity, while retaining creep properties of these alloys, are described. An entirely different approach has been successful in imparting plasticity to intermetallics based on $Fe_3Al$. The addition of carbon to form the $Fe_3AlC_{0.5}$ phase imparts ductility, while enhancing both tensile and creep strength.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0695-0708</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There would be considerable beneﬁts in developing new structural materials where high use temperatures and strength coupled with low density are minimum capabilities. Nickel and titanium aluminides exhibit considerable potential for near-term application in various branches of modern industry due to the number of property advantages they possess including low density, high melting temperature, high thermal conductivity, and excellent environmental resistance, and their amenability for signiﬁcant improvment in creep and fatigue resistance through alloying. Reliability of intermetallics when used as engineering materials has not yet been fully established. Ductility and fracture toughness at room and intermediate temperatures continue to be lower than the desired values for production implementation. In this paper, progress made towards improving strain-controlled fatigue resistance of nickel and titanium aluminides is outlined. The effects of manufacturing processes and micro alloying on low cycle fatigue behaviour of $NiAl$ are addressed. The effects of microstructure, temperature of testing, section thickness, brittle to ductile transition temperature, mean stress and environment on fatigue behaviour of same $\gamma -TiAl$ alloys are discussed.</p>

				<title>Recent advances in creep-resistant steels for power plant applications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0709-0730</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The higher steam temperatures and pressures required to achieve increase in thermal efﬁciency of fossil fuel-ﬁred power-generation plants necessitate the use of steels with improved creep rupture strength. The 9% chromium steels developed during the last three decades are of great interest in such applications. In this report, the development of steels $P91, P92$ and $E911$ is described. It is shown that the martensitic transformation in these three steels produces high dislocation density that confers signiﬁcant transient hardening. However, the dislocation density decreases during exposure at service temperatures due to recovery effects and for long-term creep strength the sub-grain structure produced under different conditions is most important. The changes in the microstructure mean that great care is needed in the extrapolation of experimental data to obtain design values. Only data from tests with rupture times above $3,000 h$ provide reasonable extrapolated values. It is further shown that for the 9% chromium steels, oxidation resistance in steam is not sufﬁciently high for their use as thin-walled components at temperatures of $600^\circ C$ and above. The potential for the development of steels of higher chromium contents (above 11%) to give an improvement in steam oxidation resistance whilst maintaining creep resistance to the 9% chromium steels is discussed.</p>

				<title>Convergent beam electron diffraction $–$ A novel technique for materials characterisation at sub-microscopic levels</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0763-0782</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a review of the developments in Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED), a technique widely used for determination of structure, symmetry details and atom positions in a crystal as small as $20Å$ in size. The understanding of this technique is related to the rapid advancements in the ﬁeld of transmission electron microscopy with respect to development of coherent, ﬁner probes and electron optics for higher spatial resolution. Energy ﬁltering devices enable imaging of several ﬁner features in the CBED pattern from which useful information about a crystal can be obtained. These include (i) three-dimensional information about the reciprocal lattice, (ii) point and space group symmetry details, (iii) lattice parameter from regions as ﬁne as $2 nm$, (iv) atom positions within a unit cell and (v) defects in crystals and (vi) thickness. Due to abundant data obtained from microscopic regions, this technique is unique and ﬁnds wide application in materials characterization. It has been used for studying problems like identiﬁcation of the presence of lattice strain, identiﬁcation of point defects etc. in a material used often in the nuclear industry, namely $9Cr–1Mo$ steel. The present paper provides the current status of CBED starting from its historical development, the information that can be obtained and its use in a variety of applications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Bulk glass-forming alloys have emerged over the past ﬁfteen years with attractive properties and technological promise. A number of alloy systems based on lanthanum, magnesium, zirconium, palladium, iron, cobalt and nickel have been discovered. Glass-forming ability depends on various factors like enthalpy of mixing, atomic size and multicomponent alloying. A number of processes is available to synthesise bulk metallic glasses. The crystallisation behaviour and mechanical properties of these alloys pose interesting scientiﬁc questions. Upon crystallisation many of these glasses transform to bulk nanocrystals and nanoquasicrystals. A detailed study of the structure and the crystallisation behaviour of glasses has enabled the elucidation of the possible atomic conﬁguration in liquid alloys. Their crystallisation behaviour can be exploited to synthesise novel nanocomposite microstructures and their mechanical properties can be enhanced. A broad overview of the present status of the science and technology of bulk metallic glasses and their potential technological uses is presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>High voltage electron microscopy (HVEM), using electron energies adequate for causing displacements of atoms from lattice sites, is a very effective technique for studying mechanisms of solid state phase transformations and for charting the path of phase evolution in real time. This has been demonstrated in studies on chemical ordering in nickel$–$molybdenum alloys and on the $\beta \to \omega$ displacement ordering in zirconium$–$niobium alloys. The enhanced diffusivity due to electron irradiation makes it possible to explore a sequence of phase evolution at low enough temperatures where even some ﬁrst-order transformations are driven by free energy $(G)$ instabilities with respect to the relevant order parameter $(\eta)$. Speciﬁc issues addressed in these studies are reviewed in this paper.</p>

					<p>The availability of high performance computers and development of efﬁcient algorithms has led to the emergence of computational materials science as the third branch of materials research complementing the traditional theoretical and experimental approaches. It has created new virtual realities in materials design that are either experimentally not realizable easily or are prohibitively expensive. The possibilities of doing calculations from ﬁrst principles have led to predictive capabilities that open up new avenues of discovering novel materials with desired properties, understanding material behaviour on the nano- to the macroscopic scale and helping research in new frontiers that could interface between nano-materials and drug design, as well as in understanding biological systems.

					<p>New process design and control methods are needed for signiﬁcantly improving productivity and reducing costs of thermomechanical processes such as hot metal forging. Current practices for accomplishing basic design tasks such as selecting the number of forming steps and specifying the processing conditions for each thermomechanical operation produce feasible solutions that are often far from optimal. Substantial improvements in effectiveness and efﬁciency can be realized through holistic approaches that optimize the whole system performance and not just individual subsystems such as workpiece material behavior, material ﬂow in dies, and equipment responses. Recent progress in the application of dynamical modelling and process design techniques using ideal forming concepts and trajectory optimization are discussed. Monitoring methods for the on-line monitoring of the process and an intelligent forging system has been proposed.</p>

				<title>Twentieth Century evolution of machining in the United States – An interpretative review</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0867-0874</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although the machining process came into use in industry at the very beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700’s, virtually no technological/mathematical representations (i. e. ‘models’), capable of describing the physics or mechanics of the machining process, came into being for over 200 years. Yet such models are essential to establishment of an engineering basis for determining proper machining parameters for obtaining predictable, high productivity in applying the machining process in practice. At last, during the 20th Century, such technology did begin to evolve, going through three main stages in that period, namely empirical modelling, science-based (predictive) modelling and computerbased modelling. Empirical modelling can be said to have had its beginning as an organized process in the late 1890s to early l900s. Science-based modelling began to emerge in the 1940s and computer-based modelling in the 1970s. Each of these three stages was ushered in by a key event in America. The ﬁrst originated with F W Taylor’s pioneering engineering research and development of empirical methodology (and equations) for estimating reasonably economic machining conditions. The second stage was primarily initiated by Merchant’s mechanics-based modelling and analysis of the basic force system that acts between cutting tool, chip and workpiece in a machining process. The third (and major) stage was the "watershed" event of the advent of digital computer technology and its application to manufacturing in general. That enabled integration of computer-based modelling with all of the databases of the full system of manufacturing.</p>

				<title>The size effect in metal cutting</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0875-0896</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>When metal is removed by machining there is substantial increase in the speciﬁc energy required with decrease in chip size. It is generally believed this is due to the fact that all metals contain defects (grain boundaries, missing and impurity atoms, etc.), and when the size of the material removed decreases, the probability of encountering a stress-reducing defect decreases. Since the shear stress and strain in metal cutting is unusually high, discontinuous microcracks usually form on the metal-cutting shear plane. If the material being cut is very brittle, or the compressive stress on the shear plane is relatively low, microcracks grow into gross cracks giving rise to discontinuous chip formation. When discontinuous microcracks form on the shear plane they weld and reform as strain proceeds, thus joining the transport of dislocations in accounting for the total slip of the shear plane. In the presence of a contaminant, such as $CCl_4$ vapour at a low cutting speed, the rewelding of microcracks decreases, resulting in decrease in the cutting force required for chip formation. A number of special experiments are described in the paper that support the transport of microcracks across the shear plane, and the important role compressive stress plays on the shear plane. Relatively recently, an alternative explanation for the size effect in cutting was provided based on the premise that shear stress increases with increase in strain rate. When an attempt is made to apply this to metal cutting by Dinesh et al (2001) it is assumed in the analysis that the von Mises criterion pertains to the shear plane. This is inconsistent with the experimental ﬁndings of Merchant. Until this difﬁculty is taken care of, together with the promised experimental veriﬁcation of the strain rate approach, it should be assumed that the strain rate effect may be responsible for some notion of the size effect in metal cutting. However, based on the many experiments discussed here, it is very unlikely that it is totally responsible for the size effect in metal cutting as inferred in Dinesh et al (2001).</p>

				<title>Controlled wear of vitriﬁed abrasive materials for precision grinding applications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0897-0914</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study of bonding hard materials such as aluminium oxide and cubic boron nitride (cBN) and the nature of interfacial cohesion between these materials and glass is very important from the perspective of high precision grinding. Vitriﬁed grinding wheels are typically used to remove large volumes of metal and to produce components with very high tolerances. It is expected that the same grinding wheel is used for both rough and ﬁnish machining operations. Therefore, the grinding wheel, and in particular its bonding system, is expected to react differently to a variety of machining operations. In order to maintain the integrity of the grinding wheel, the bonding system that is used to hold abrasive grains in place reacts differently to forces that are placed on individual bonding bridges. This paper examines the role of vitriﬁcation heat treatment on the development of strength between abrasive grains and bonding bridges, and the nature of fracture and wear in vitriﬁed grinding wheels that are used for precision grinding applications.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0915-0924</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ductile streaks produced during diamond grinding of hard and brittle materials have aided the subsequent process of polishing. Two novel techniques were used to study the formation of ductile mode streaks during diamond grinding (primary process) of germanium, silicon, and glass. In the ﬁrst technique, aspheric surfaces were generated on $Ge$ and $Si$ at conventional speeds $(5000 rpm)$. In the second technique, diamond grinding of plano surfaces on glass and $Si$ surfaces using high speed $(100,000 rpm)$ was carried out. Form accuracy, surface ﬁnish and ductile mode grinding streaks are discussed in this paper. It was found that resinoid diamond wheels gave more ductile streaks than metal-bonded wheels but better form accuracy was obtained with the latter. Ductile streaks were obtained more easily with pyrex rather than with $BK 7$ glass thus necessitating very little time for polishing. Ductile streaks appeared in abundance on germanium rather than silicon. Both the novel grinding techniques were used on $CNC$ machining centres.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A major challenge in optics is to make optical components like mirrors and lenses smaller and cheaper. This is achieved by designing optical components that have conformal or free-form shapes. A free-form optic is deﬁned as one that is not symmetrical about any axis. These highly demanding requirements are met by single point diamond machining in rigid ultra precision machine tools.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An effective metal-cutting tool is usually a combination of a hard coating and a tough substrate. The successful deposition of diamond outside its thermodynamic stability range has stimulated the development of a new class of cutting tools: those with diamond-coated inserts of any desired style and edge geometry. The successful implementation of diamond coatings also expedited similar research in the deposition of cubic boron nitride. This paper presents superhard coating tools, with emphasis on diamond-coated $WC–Co$ tools, the corresponding deposition of technologies and the foreseen metal-cutting applications.</p>

					<p>In order to diamond-turn optical glasses to a nanometric surface ﬁnish, it is critical to determine the transition point from brittle mode to ductile mode. This paper presents various experimental techniques to study this transition and discusses the mechanism of the surface generation. It has been recognized that tool wear is a serious issue in diamond turning of glasses. Thus, research in future should be concentrated on this ﬁeld to enable the technology to be applied in commercial production.</p>

				<title>Nano ﬁnish grinding of brittle materials using electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) technique</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0957-0974</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent developments in grinding have opened up new avenues for ﬁnishing of hard and brittle materials with nano-surface ﬁnish, high tolerance and accuracy. Grinding with superabrasive wheels is an excellent way to produce ultraprecision surface ﬁnish. However, superabrasive diamond grits need higher bonding strength while grinding, which metal-bonded grinding wheels can offer. Truing and dressing of the wheels are major problems and they tend to glaze because of wheel loading. When grinding with superabrasive wheels, wheel loading can be avoided by dressing periodically to obtain continuous grinding. Electrolytic inprocess dressing (ELID) is the most suitable process for dressing metal-bonded grinding wheels during the grinding process. Nano-surface ﬁnish can be achieved only when chip removal is done at the atomic level. Recent developments of ductile mode machining of hard and brittle materials show that plastically deformed chip removal minimizes the subsurface damage of the workpiece. When chip deformation takes place in the ductile regime, a defect-free nano-surface is possible and it completely eliminates the polishing process. ELID is one of the processes used for atomic level metal removal and nano-surface ﬁnish. However, no proper and detailed studies have been carried out to clarify the fundamental characteristics for making this process a robust one. Consequently, an attempt has been made in this study to understand the fundamental characteristics of ELID grinding and their inﬂuence on surface ﬁnish.</p>

				<page>0991-0998</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work is an experimental study of the differential scanning calorimetry characterisation of polymer materials used in food packaging materials, such as polypropylene $(0.03 mm)$, polyethylene ($0.1$ and $0.03 mm$), poly($D-(-)-\beta$-hydroxybutyrate) (powder), two-layered polypropylene $(0.064 mm)$, and two-layered polypropylene with poly-vinylidene-chloride (0.012/0.021). The polymer stability was checked by simulation of conditions during food preparation in microwave ovens, sterilisation or rapid freezing.</p>
					<p>The materials were tested in the temperature range from 40 to $200^\circ C$ at different scan rates from 2 to $30^\circ C min^{−1}$ during heating or cooling. The enthalpies show a high correlation coefﬁcient (0.964) with scan rate. All samples undergo phase change in the temperature range from 107 to $173^\circ C$ during heating and enthalpies are in the range from 31.8 to $71.1 J g^{−1}$ Upon subsequent cooling from $200^\circ C$, the temperature range of phase changes is shifted to lower temperatures from 86 to $102^\circ C$ with enthalpies ranging from 30.4 to $57.8 J g^{−1}$.</p>
					<p>Experiments with exposure of polymers to microwave radiation and freezing prove that the phase change considering the temperature range is very similar in all experiments.</p>

The effect of these deformations and dielectric ﬁlling on $TE_{10}, TE_{20}$ mode cutoff frequencies and passband is studied. The results are compared with those of $x$-band rectangular waveguides with depression and protrusion with air medium. $TE_{10}$, $TE_{20}$ mode cutoff frequencies for waveguides with depression and protrusion and ﬁlled with dielectric medium are less than that for air medium.

				<abstract>
					<p>Frequency domain representation of a short-term heart-rate time series (HRTS) signal is a popular method for evaluating the cardiovascular control system. The spectral parameters, viz. percentage power in low frequency band (%PLF), percentage power in high frequency band (%PHF), power ratio of low frequency to high frequency (PRLH), peak power ratio of low frequency to high frequency (PPRLH) and total power (TP) are extrapolated from the averaged power spectrum of twenty-ﬁve healthy subjects, and 16 acute anterior-wall and nine acute inferior-wall myocardial infarction (MI) patients. It is observed that parasympathetic activity predominates in healthy subjects. From this observation we conclude that during acute myocardial infarction, the anterior wall MI has stimulated sympathetic activity, while the acute inferior wall MI has stimulated parasympathetic activity. Results obtained from ARMA-based analysis of heart-rate time series signals are capable of complementing the clinical examination results.</p>

				<page>1037-1046</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recognition of text recorded in Pitman shorthand language (PSL) is an interesting research problem. Automatic reading of PSL and generating equivalent English text is very challenging. The most important task involved here is the accurate recognition of Pitman stroke patterns, which constitute “text” in PSL.</p>
					<p>The paper describes automatic recognition of the strokes of the PSL at word level. A pen-down to pen-up sequence makes a stroke, which is a composition of primitives. The words are separated based on pen-down and pen-up points. The features that form a word (a stroke) are grouped ﬁrst. Next, primitives and their sequence are identiﬁed and passed to a recognizer which identiﬁes the word. A tangent-based vector through the contour of a stroke identiﬁes the consonant primitives. Any other marks close to the stroke but not associated with the contour of a stroke represent the vowel markers.</p>

				<title>The effects of processing on the nutritional composition and quality evaluation of candied celeriac</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0012</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, a new candying procedure with partial re-use of sugar syrup is proposed. Physicochemical analysis, together with sensory evaluation, of candied celeriac samples was done. Candying was performed in a pilot unit at $65^\circ C$, through three cycles of 5 hours duration each. Sugar syrups of $75^\circ $ Brix were used. Effects of 1% $(m/v)$ citric and 1% $(m/v)$ ascorbic acid addition, as well as the drying of candied celeriac ($60^\circ C$ for $8 h$) were studied. Sugar syrup deterioration was estimated by the concentration of hydroxymethylfurfural. The results obtained showed that there were no signiﬁcant $(P \le 0.01)$ differences in total dry matter and total sugar content between samples, while the increases after drying were signiﬁcant $(P \ge 0.01)$. Differences were observed in sugar compositions between samples. After three cycles, samples turned lighter, with decreased $L^*$ values after drying. The celeriac from the ﬁrst cycle of the ascorbic acid addition procedure was adjudged best with respect to all quality parameters. The decreased concentration of hydroxymethylfurfural conﬁrmed that re-use of sugar syrup is possible.</p>

				<title>Tribomechanical micronization and activation of whey protein concentrate and zeolite</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0013-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tribomechanics is a part of physics that is concerned with the study of phenomena that appear during milling under dynamic conditions. Tribomechanical micronization and activation (TMA) of whey protein concentrates (WPC) and zeolites (type clinoptilolite) were carried out. Samples of powdered WPC and zeolite were treated with the laboratory TMA equipment. The treatment was carried out at two various rotor speeds: 16,000 and $22,000 r.p.m.$ at ambient temperature. Analyses of the particle size and distribution as well as the speciﬁc area and scanning electron microscopy were carried out on the powdered WPC and zeolite, before and after the TMA treatment. Suspensions of the WPC and zeolite were treated with ultrasound, just before determining the particle size distribution, at $50 kHz$. The results showed that tribomechanical treatment causes signiﬁcant decrease in particle size, change in particle size distribution and increase in speciﬁc area of WPC and zeolite. These changes of the treated materials depend on the type of the material, the level of inserting particles, the planned angle of the impact, internal rubbing and the planned number of impacts. The effects found became stronger as the rotor speed of the TMA equipment increased (16,000 to $22,000 rpm$). Ultrasonic treatment of suspension of tribomechanically treated WPC resulted infurther breakdown of partly damaged protein globules as proved with the statistic analyses. No further changes in their granulometric composition were caused by ultrasonic treatment of a suspension of tribomechanically treated zeolite.</p>

The experiment was conducted in a laboratory ﬂume using the Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). Proﬁles of time-averaged velocity components, turbulent intensity components, turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stresses at different azimuthal planes are presented. Vector plots of ﬂow ﬁelds at azimuthal and horizontal planes show the presence of a primary vortex associated with the downﬂow in the upstream side of the abutment and a wake vortex on the downstream side. The shear stresses acting on the bed around the abutment are estimated from the Reynolds stresses and velocity gradients.

				<title>Comparative efﬁciencies of three parallel algorithms for nonlinear implicit transient dynamic analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0057-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The work reported in this paper is motivated by the need to develop portable parallel processing algorithms and codes which can run on a variety of hardware platforms without any modiﬁcations. The prime aim of the research work reported here is to test the portability of the parallel algorithms and also to study and understand the comparative efﬁciencies of three parallel algorithms developed for implicit time integration technique. The standard message passing interface (MPI) is used to develop parallel algorithms for computing nonlinear dynamic response of large structures employing implicit time-marching scheme. The parallel algorithms presented in this paper are developed under the broad framework of non-overlapped domain decomposition technique. Numerical studies indicate that the parallel algorithm devised employing the conventional form of Newmark time integration algorithm is faster than the predictor–corrector form. It is also accurate and highly adaptive to ﬁne grain computations. The group implicit algorithm is found to be extremely superior in performance when compared to the other two parallel algorithms. This algorithm is better suited for large size problems on coarse grain environment as the resulting submeshes will obviously be large and thus permit larger time steps without losing accuracy.</p>

				<title>Experimental investigations on buckling of cylindrical shells under axial compression and transverse shear</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0093-0115</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents experimental studies on buckling of cylindrical shell models under axial and transverse shear loads. Tests are carried out using an experimental facility specially designed, fabricated and installed, with provision for in-situ measurement of the initial geometric imperfections. The shell models are made by rolling and seam welding process and hence are expected to have imperfections more or less of a kind similar to that of real shell structures. The present work thus differs from most of the earlier investigations. The measured maximum imperfections $\delta_{max}$ are of the order of $±3t$ (t = thickness). The buckling loads obtained experimentally are compared with the numerical buckling values obtained through ﬁnite element method (FEM). In the case of axial buckling, the imperfect geometry is obtained in four ways and in the case of transverse shear buckling, the FE modelling of imperfect geometry is done in two ways. The initial geometric imperfections affect the load carrying capacity. The load reduction is considerable in the case of axial compression and is marginal in the case of transverse shear buckling. Comparisons between experimental buckling loads under axial compression, reveal that the extent of imperfection, rather than its maximum value, in a specimen inﬂuences the failure load. Buckling tests under transverse shear are conducted with and without axial constraints. While differences in experimental loads are seen to exist between the two conditions, the numerical values are almost equal. The buckling modes are different, and the experimentally observed and numerically predicted values are in complete disagreement.</p>

					<p>Results show that austempered ductile iron has the highest thermal cycling resistance, followed by pearlitic ductile iron and compacted graphite iron, while grey cast iron exhibits the lowest resistance. Microstructural analysis of test specimens subjected to thermal cycling indicates that matrix decomposition and grain growth are responsible for the reduction in hardness while graphite oxidation, de-cohesion and grain boundary separation are responsible for the reduction in the modulus of elasticity upon thermal cycling.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Conventionally, the parameters of a sliding mode controller (SMC) are selected so as to reduce the time spent in the reaching mode. Although, an upper bound on the time to reach (reaching time) the sliding surface is easily derived, performance guarantee in the state/error space needs more consideration. This paper addresses the design of constant plus proportional rate reaching law-based SMC for second-order nonlinear systems. It is shown that this controller imposes a bounding second-order error-dynamics, and thus guarantees robust performance during the reaching phase. The choice of the controller parameters based on the time to reach a desirable level of output tracking error (OTE), rather than on the reaching time is proposed. Using the Lyapunov theory, it is shown that parameter selections, based on the reaching time criterion, may need substantially larger time to achieve the OTE. Simulation results are presented for a nonlinear spring-massdamper system. It is seen that parameter selections based on the proposed OTE criterion, result in substantially quicker tracking, while using similar levels of control effort.</p>

				<title>Bayesian and Dempster–Shafer fusion</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>08145-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kalman Filter is traditionally viewed as a prediction–correction ﬁltering algorithm. In this work we show that it can be viewed as a Bayesian fusion algorithm and derive it using Bayesian arguments. We begin with an outline of Bayes theory, using it to discuss well-known quantities such as priors, likelihood and posteriors, and we provide the basic Bayesian fusion equation. We derive the Kalman Filter from this equation using a novel method to evaluate the Chapman–Kolmogorov prediction integral. We then use the theory to fuse data from multiple sensors. Vying with this approach is the Dempster–Shafer theory, which deals with measures of “belief”, and is based on the nonclassical idea of “mass” as opposed to probability. Although these two measures look very similar, there are some differences. We point them out through outlining the ideas of the Dempster– Shafer theory and presenting the basic Dempster–Shafer fusion equation. Finally we compare the two methods, and discuss the relative merits and demerits using an illustrative example.</p>

					<p>In this paper, the utilization of multi-sensors of different types, their characteristics, and their data-fusion in launch vehicles to achieve the goal of injecting the satellite into a precise orbit is explained. Performance requirements of sensors and their redundancy management in a typical launch vehicle are also included. The role of an integrated system level-test bed for evaluating multi-sensors and mission performance in a typical launch vehicle mission is described.

				<title>Precision pointing of imaging spacecraft using gyro-based attitude reference with horizon sensor updates</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0189-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Remote sensing satellites are required to meet stringent pointing and drift rate requirements for imaging operations. For achieving these pointing and stability requirements, continuous and accurate three-axis attitude information is required. Inertial sensors like gyros provide continuous attitude information with better short-term stability and less random errors. However, gyro measurements are affected by drifts. Hence over time, attitudes based on the gyro reference slowly diverge from the true attitudes. On the other hand, line-of-sight (LOS) sensors like horizon sensors provide attitude information with long-term stability. Their measurements however are affected by the presence of random instrumental errors and other systematic errors. The limitations of inertial and line-of-sight sensors are mutually exclusive. Hence, by optimal fusion of attitude information from both these sensors, it is possible to retain the advantages and overcome the limitations of both, thereby providing the precise attitude information required for control.</p>
					<p>This paper describes an improved earth-pointing scheme by fusion of the threeaxis attitude information from gyros and horizon sensor roll and pitch measurements along with yaw updates from the digital sun sensor. A Kalman Filter is used to estimate the three-axis attitude by online estimation and corrections of various errors from the sensor measurements. Variations in orbit rate components are also accounted for using spacecraft position and velocity measurements from the satellite positioning system. Thus precise earth-pointing is achieved.</p>

				<title>Cluster-based centralized data fusion for tracking maneuvering targets using interacting multiple model algorithm</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0205-0216</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm has proved to be useful in tracking maneuvering targets. Tracking accuracy can be further improved using data fusion. Tracking of multiple targets using multiple sensors and fusing them at a central site using centralized architecture involves communication of large volumes of measurements to a common site. This results in heavy processing requirement at the central site. Moreover, track updates have to be obtained in the fusion centre before the next measurement arrives. For solving this computational complexity, a cluster-based parallel processing solution is presented in this paper. In this scheme, measurements are sent to the data fusion centre where the measurements are partitioned and given to the slave processors in the cluster. The slave processors use the IMM algorithm to get accurate updates of the tracks. The master processor collects the updated tracks and performs data fusion using ‘weight decision approach’. The improvement in the computation time using clusters in the data fusion centre is presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Estimation of attitudes from a low-cost miniaturized inertial platform using Kalman Filter-based sensor fusion algorithm</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0217-0235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Due to costs, size and mass, commercially available inertial navigation systems are not suitable for small, autonomous ﬂying vehicles like ALEX and other UAVs. In contrast, by using modern MEMS (or of similar class) sensors, hardware costs, size and mass can be reduced substantially. However, low-cost sensors often suffer from inaccuracy and are inﬂuenced greatly by temperature variation. In this work, such inaccuracies and dependence on temperature variations have been studied, modelled and compensated in order to reach an adequate quality of measurements for the estimation of attitudes. This has been done applying a Kalman Filter-based sensor fusion algorithm that combines sensor models, error parameters and estimation scheme. Attitude estimation from low-cost sensors is ﬁrst realized in a Matlab/Simulink platform and then implemented on hardware by programming the micro controller and validated. The accuracies of the estimated roll and pitch attitudes are well within the stipulated accuracy level of $\pm5^\circ $ for the ALEX. However, the estimation of heading, which is mainly derived from the magnetometer readings, seems to be inﬂuenced greatly by the variation in local magnetic ﬁeld.</p>

					<p>The propagation of plane waves in ﬁbre-reinforced, anisotropic, elastic media is discussed. The expressions for the phase velocity of quasi-$P (qP)$ and quasi-$SV (qSV)$ waves propagating in a plane containing the reinforcement direction are obtained as functions of the angle between the propagation and reinforcement directions. Closed form expressions for the amplitude ratios for $qP$ and $qSV$ waves reﬂected at the free surface of a ﬁbre-reinforced, anisotropic, homogeneous, elastic half-space are obtained. These expressions are used to study the variation of amplitude ratios with angle of incidence. It is found that reinforcement has a signiﬁcant effect on the amplitude ratios and critical angle.</p>

				<title>Effect of EGR on the exhaust gas temperature and exhaust opacity in compression ignition engines</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0275-0284</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In diesel engines, $NOx$ formation is a highly temperature-dependent phenomenon and takes place when the temperature in the combustion chamber exceeds $2000 K$. Therefore, in order to reduce $NOx$ emissions in the exhaust, it is necessary to keep peak combustion temperatures under control.</p>
					<p>One simple way of reducing the $NOx$ emission of a diesel engine is by late injection of fuel into the combustion chamber. This technique is effective but increases fuel consumption by 10–15%, which necessitates the use of more effective $NOx$ reduction techniques like exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Re-circulating part of the exhaust gas helps in reducing $NOx$, but appreciable particulate emissions are observed at high loads, hence there is a trade-off between $NOx$ and smoke emission. To get maximum beneﬁt from this trade-off, a particulate trap may be used to reduce the amount of unburnt particulates in EGR, which in turn reduce the particulate emission also.</p>
					<p>An experimental investigation was conducted to observe the effect of exhaust gas re-circulation on the exhaust gas temperatures and exhaust opacity. The experimental setup for the proposed experiments was developed on a two-cylinder, direct injection, air-cooled, compression ignition engine. A matrix of experiments was conducted for observing the effect of different quantities of EGR on exhaust gas temperatures and opacity.</p>

				<title>Application of meshless EFG method in ﬂuid ﬂow problems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0285-0296</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with the solution of two-dimensional ﬂuid ﬂow problems using the meshless element-free Galerkin method. The unknown function of velocity $u(x)$ is approximated by moving least square approximants $u^h(x)$. These. approximants are constructed by using a weight function, a monomial basis function and a set of non-constant coefﬁcients. The variational method is used for the development of discrete equations. The Lagrange multiplier technique has been used to enforce the essential boundary conditions. A new exponential weight function has been proposed. The results are obtained for a two-dimensional model problem using different EFG weight functions and compared with the results of ﬁnite element and exact methods. The results obtained using proposed weight functions (exponential) are more promising as compared to those obtained using existing weight functions (quartic spline and Gaussian).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Damage to structures may occur as a result of normal operations, accidents, deterioration or severe natural events such as earthquakes and storms. Most often the extent and location of damage may be determined through visual inspection. However, in some cases this may not be feasible. The basic strategy applied in this study is to train a neural network to recognize the behaviour of the undamaged structure as well as of the structure with various possible damaged states. When this trained network is subjected to the measured response, it should be able to detect any existing damage. This idea is applied on a simple cantilever beam. Strain and displacement are used as possible candidates for damage identiﬁcation by a back-propagation neural network. The superiority of strain over displacement for identiﬁcation of damage has been observed in this study.</p>

					<p>The paper presents a study of propagation of Love waves in a poroelastic layer resting over a poro-elastic half-space. Pores contain nothing of mechanical or energetic signiﬁcance. The study reveals that such a medium transmits two types of love waves. The ﬁrst front depends upon the modulus of rigidity of the elastic matrix of the medium and is the same as the love wave in an elastic layer over an elastic half-space. The second front depends upon the change in volume fraction of the pores. As the ﬁrst front is well-known, the second front has been investigated numerically for different values of void parameters. It is observed that the second front is many times faster than the shear wave in the void medium due to change in volume fraction of the pores and is signiﬁcant.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Recent experimental results by us have indicated that the load-drop technique can serve as a valid fracture criterion for predicting elastic–plastic fracture in extra deep drawn (EDD) steel sheets or in predominantly plane stress conditions. The purpose of this investigation is to examine the validity of a $J$-integral as a fracture parameter and the $J$-CTOD relation for the determination of critical CTOD in predominantly plane stress fracture (CTOD-crack tip opening displacement). Fracture tests were performed and experimental results were generated on fracture behaviour of EDD $(0.06%C)$ steel sheets with $CT$ specimens and using ‘load-drop’ as a fracture criterion. Critical CTOD was determined by using the $J$- CTOD relation in addition to several existing techniques. A full $3-D$ ﬁnite element model was formulated to verify the critical load, critical CTOD and plastic-zone size. The critical CTOD was shown to increase with increasing specimen thickness and appeared to be approaching a higher limiting value. The characteristic features of predominantly plane stress fracture or general yielding fracture mechanics are summarized in conclusion.</p>

				<title>Investigation of neutronic performance of a peaceful nuclear explosive reactor (PACER) evaluating $UF_4$ and $ThF_4$ nuclides</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0401-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, neutronic behaviour of a peaceful nuclear explosion reactor (PACER) producing approx $1.2 GWe$ power from fusion explosions is analysed considering $ThF_4$ and $UF_4$ as ﬁssile zones. $UF_4$ and $ThF_4$ are put in to the system adjacent to the inner-side of the ﬂibe coolant zone positions (distance between explosive region and fuel zone, $DR = 50, 100, 200, 400, 500$ and $700 cm$). Flibe percentages are taken to be 25, 50, 75 and 100%. It is found that optimum combinations of ﬁssile zone thickness, coolant zone position and coolant percentages are $10 cm, 200 cm$ and 25% ﬂibe for $UF_4$ and $10 cm, 50 cm$ and 25% ﬂibe for $ThF_4$. The behaviour of fuels mentioned above has been observed over a period of 30 years at discrete time intervals, $\Delta t = 30$ days. In the case of $UF_4$; $M$ values at $DR = 200 cm$ reach 5.35, 5.22, 4.88, and 4.88 from 3.12, 2.98, 2.83 and 2.83, for 25, 50, 75, 100% ﬂibe respectively. For $ThF_4$ at $DR = 50 cm$; $M$ values reach from 1.61, 1.54, 1.50 and 1.46 to 1.93, 2.00, 2.04 and 1.99 for 25, 50, 75, 100% ﬂibe respectively. Cumulative ﬁssile fuel breeding (CFFE) values reach up to 5.5 from 0.7 at $DR = 200$ and 25% case for $UF_4$, and up to 6.36% from 0%, at $DR = 50$ and 25% ﬂibe, for $ThF_4$, at the end of the operation period.</p>

				<title>Free asymmetric transverse vibration of polar orthotropic annular sector plate with thickness varying parabolically in radial direction</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0415-0428</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present paper, free asymmetric transverse vibrations of a nonuniform polar orthotropic annular sector plate, with parabolically varying thickness in the radial direction, have been studied on the basis of classical plate theory. The circular edges of the plate are elastically restrained against translation and rotation while the straight (radial) edges are simply-supported. Fourth-order linear differential equations with variable coefﬁcients governing the motion have been solved by using the collocation interpolation technique with Chebyshev points as the interpolating nodes. Frequency parameters of the plate with ﬂexible boundary conditions at the circular edges for some typical values of the taper parameters, the rigidity ratios and the radii ratio have been presented.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0429-0447</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A dynamical two-dimensional problem of thermoelasticity has been considered to investigate the disturbance due to mechanical (horizontal or vertical) and thermal source in a homogeneous, thermally conducting orthorhombic material. Laplace–Fourier transforms are applied to basic equations to form a vector matrix differential equation, which is then solved by eigenvalue approach. The displacements, stresses and temperature distribution so obtained in the physical domain are computed numerically and illustrated graphically. The numerical results of these quantities for zinc crystal-like material are illustrated to compare the results for different theories of generalised thermoelasticity for an insulated boundary and a temperature gradient boundary.</p>

				<title>A stochastic dynamic programming model for stream water quality management</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0477-0497</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with development of a seasonal fraction-removal policy model for waste load allocation in streams addressing uncertainties due to randomness and fuzziness. A stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model is developed to arrive at the steady-state seasonal fraction-removal policy. A fuzzy decision model (FDM) developed by us in an earlier study is used to compute the system performance measure required in the SDP model. The state of the system in a season is deﬁned by streamﬂows at the headwaters during the season and the initial DO deﬁcit at some pre-speciﬁed checkpoints. The random variation of streamﬂows is included in the SDP model through seasonal transitional probabilities. The decision vector consists of seasonal fraction-removal levels for the efﬂuent dischargers. Uncertainty due to imprecision (fuzziness) associated with water quality goals is addressed using the concept of fuzzy decision. Responses of pollution control agencies to the resulting end-of-season DO deﬁcit vector and that of dischargers to the fraction-removal levels are treated as fuzzy, and modelled with appropriate membership functions. Application of the model is illustrated with a case study of the Tungabhadra river in India.</p>

				<title>Optimal design of unit hydrographs using probability distribution and genetic algorithms</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0499-0508</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A nonlinear optimization model is developed to transmute a unit hydrograph into a probability distribution function (PDF). The objective function is to minimize the sum of the square of the deviation between predicted and actual direct runoff hydrograph of a watershed. The predicted runoff hydrograph is estimated by using a PDF. In a unit hydrograph, the depth of rainfall excess must be unity and the ordinates must be positive. Incorporation of a PDF ensures that the depth of rainfall excess for the unit hydrograph is unity, and the ordinates are also positive. Unit hydrograph ordinates are in terms of intensity of rainfall excess on a discharge per unit catchment area basis, the unit area thus representing the unit rainfall excess. The proposed method does not have any constraint. The nonlinear optimization formulation is solved using binary-coded genetic algorithms. The number of variables to be estimated by optimization is the same as the number of probability distribution parameters; gamma and log-normal probability distributions are used. The existing nonlinear programming model for obtaining optimal unit hydrograph has also been solved using genetic algorithms, where the constrained nonlinear optimization problem is converted to an unconstrained problem using penalty parameter approach. The results obtained are compared with those obtained by the earlier LP model and are fairly similar.</p>

				<title>Inﬂuence of processing and reinforcement on microstructure and impact behaviour of magnesium alloy AM100</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0509-0523</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reinforcing magnesium alloys with a discontinuously dispersed ceramic phase has engineered a new family of materials that are marketed under the trade name “metal-matrix composites”. Continuous research efforts in the processing of these materials have provided the necessary impetus for their emergence and use in structural, automotive and even aerospace-related components. In this paper we report the results of a study aimed at understanding the role of short-ﬁbre reinforcements (discontinuously dispersed through the metal-matrix of magnesium alloy AM100) on impact deformation and fracture behaviour. In particular, the role of volume fraction of the reinforcing phase on impact energy and fracture behaviour is presented and discussed. An increase in short-ﬁbre reinforcement content in the magnesium alloy metal-matrix is observed to have a detrimental inﬂuence on impact energy when compared to the unreinforced counterpart. Micro cracking in the metal-matrix coupled with failure of the reinforcing ﬁbres, both independently dispersed and in clusters, dominates the fracture sequence at the microscopic level. The ﬁnal fracture behaviour of the composite material is discussed in the light of the concurrent and mutually interactive inﬂuences of nature of loading, local stress state, intrinsic microstructural effects and deformation characteristics of the composite constituents.</p>

					<p>The paper reports an investigation into the effect of interfacial friction law during the forging of a powder circular disc with large slenderness ratio $(L/D)$ between two ﬂat dies. The deformation pattern during the operation is inﬂuenced by many factors, which interact with each other in a complex manner. The relative velocity between the work piece material and the die surface, together with high interfacial pressure and/or deformation modes, creates the conditions essential for adhesion in addition to sliding. The decisive factors are the interfacial conditions, initial relative density of the preform and geometry of the preform. An attempt has been made to determine the most realistic interfacial friction law and die pressures developed during such forging using an upper bound approach. The results so obtained are presented graphically and discussed critically to illustrate the interaction of various interfacial friction laws involved.</p>

				<page>0545-0557</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) beam-line for X-ray absorption studies using energy dispersive geometry and position sensitive detector is being developed for the INDUS-II synchrotron source. The optical design of the beam-line has been completed based on the working principle that a single crystal bent in the shape of an ellipse by a crystal bender would act as a dispersing as well as focusing element. The heart of the beam-line is the crystal bender which has been designed on the basis of the principle of four-point bending and has been fabricated indigenously. The crystal bender is capable of producing pre-deﬁned elliptical curvature on a crystal surface by applying different couples at the two-ends of the crystal which has variable width along its length. The focusing property of the crystal bender has been tested using a laser source and has been compared with the theoretically simulated results.</p>

				<title>Enhancing spoken connected-digit recognition accuracy by error correction codes – A novel scheme</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Recognizing spoken connected-digit numbers accurately is an important problem and has very many applications. Though state-of-the-art word recognition systems have gained acceptable accuracy levels, the accuracy of recognition of current connected spoken digits (and other short words) is very poor. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme to enhance the accuracy of recognizing a connected number. The basic idea proposed in this paper is to increase the number of digits in a number and use these appended digits to increase the overall accuracy of recognizing the number, as is done in the error-correcting code literature. We further show that the developed scheme is able to uniquely and exactly correct single-digit errors.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Interestingly, an esoteric branch of pure mathematics called “functional analysis”, more general and profound than variational calculus and originally developed by mathematicians, can be employed to explain clearly how the ﬁnite element machinery works. In a very abstract way, ﬁnite element results can be portrayed as “shadows” or orthogonal projections on predetermined function subspaces of the analytical results, known or unknown. Herein lies the philosophy of the ﬁnite element method. In the present work, an effort has been made to validate this important aspect of the ﬁnite element method at the element level through a particular differential equation representing a speciﬁc case of equilibrium.</p>

					<p>A couple of non-convex search strategies, based on the genetic algorithm, are suggested and numerically explored in the context of large-deﬂection analysis of planar, elastic beams. The ﬁrst of these strategies is based on the stationarity of the energy functional in the equilibrium state and may therefore be considered weak. The second approach, on the other hand, attempts to directly solve the governing differential equation within an optimisation framework and such a solution may be thought of as strong. Several numerical illustrations and veriﬁcations with ‘exact’ solutions, if available, are provided.</p>

				<title>Hydrodynamic coefﬁcients for water-wave diffraction by spherical structures</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0617-0628</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Evaluation of hydrodynamic coefﬁcients and loads on submerged or ﬂoating bodies is of great signiﬁcance in designing these structures. Some special regular-shaped geometries such as those of cylindrical (circular, elliptic) and spherical (hemisphere, sphere, spheroid) structures are usually considered to obtain analytical solutions to wave diffraction and radiation problems. The work presented here is the result of water-wave interaction with submerged spheres. Analytical expressions for various hydrodynamic coefﬁcients and loads due to the diffraction of water waves by a submerged sphere are obtained. The exciting force components due to surge and heave motions are derived by solving the diffraction problem. Theory of multipole expansions is used to express the velocity potentials in terms of an inﬁnite series of associated Legendre polynomials with unknown coefﬁcients and the orthogonality of the polynomials is utilized to simplify the expressions. Since the inﬁnite series appearing in various expressions have excellent truncation properties, they are evaluated by considering only a ﬁnite number of terms. Gaussian quadrature is used to evaluate the integrals. Numerical estimates for the analytical expressions for the hydrodynamic coefﬁcients and loads are presented for various depth to radius ratios. Consideration of more values for depth makes it easy to compare the results with those available. The results obtained match closely with those obtained earlier by Wang and Wu and their coworkers.</p>

In order to account for the non-Newtonian effect, a special type of third-grade ﬂuid is considered.

				<title>Numerical study of effect of oxygen fraction on local entropy generation in a methane–air burner</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0641-0667</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study considers numerical simulation of the combustion of methane with air, including oxygen and nitrogen, in a burner and the numerical solution of local entropy generation rate due to high temperature and velocity gradients in the combustion chamber. The effects of equivalence ratio $(\phi)$ and oxygen percentage $(\gamma)$ on combustion and entropy generation rates are investigated for different $\phi$(from 0·5 to 1·0) and $\gamma$ values (from 10 to 30%). Combustion is simulated for the fuel mass ﬂow rate resulting in the same heat transfer rate $(\dot{Q})$ to the combustion chamber in each case. Numerical calculation of combustion is performed individually for all cases with the use of the Fluent CFD code. Furthermore, a computer program has been developed to calculate the volumetric entropy generation rate and the other thermodynamic parameters numerically by using the results of the calculations performed with the FLUENT code. The predictions show that the increase of $\phi$ (or the decrease of $\gamma$) signiﬁcantly reduces the reaction rate levels. Average temperature in the combustion chamber increases by about 70 and 35% with increase of $\gamma$ (from 10 to 30%) and $\phi$ (from 0·5 to 1·0) respectively. With increase of $\gamma$ from 10 to 30%, volumetric local entropy generation rate decreases by about 9 and 4% for $\phi =$ 0·5 and 1·0 respectively, while total entropy generation rate decreases exponentially and the merit numbers increase. The ratio of the rates useful energy transfer to irreversibility therefore improves as the oxygen percentage increases.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with the effect of temperature on gravity waves in a compressible liquid layer over a solid half-space. It has been assumed that the liquid layer is under the action of gravity, while the solid half-space is under the inﬂuence of initial compressive hydrostatic stress. When the temperature of the half-space is altered, gravity waves propagate through the liquid layer along with sub-oceanic Rayleigh waves in the system. A new frequency equation has been derived here for gravity waves and sub-oceanic Rayleigh waves.</p>
					<p>It has been shown graphically that the phase velocity of gravity waves is inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by the initial compressive hydrostatic stress present in the solid half-space, for a particular value of the phase velocity of sub-oceanic Rayleigh waves and different coupling co-efﬁcients of the temperature.</p>

Results are compared with available experimental data and previously published workshop results. Numerical strategies are kept the same for all the cases. Results are also discussed keeping in view limitations of LES methodology of modelling for practical problems and current developments.

					<p>An ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) system has been designed, fabricated indigenously and commissioned on Tokamak Aditya. The system has been commissioned to operate between 20·0 and $47·0 MHz$ at a maximum power of $200 kW$ continuous wave (CW). Duration of $500 ms$ is sufﬁcient for operation on Aditya, however, the same system feeds the ﬁnal stage of the $1·5 MW$ ICRH system being prepared for the steady-state superconducting tokamak $(SST-1)$ for a duration of 1000 s. Radio frequency (RF) power $(225 kW)$ has been generated and successfully tested on a dummy load for 100s at $30·0 MHz$. Lower powers have been coupled to Aditya in a breakdown experiment.

				<title>Harmonics and voltage stability analysis in power systems including thyristor-controlled reactor</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0057-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, non-sinusoidal quantities and voltage stability, both known as power quality criteria, are examined together in detail. The widespread use of power electronics elements cause the existence of signiﬁcant non-sinusoidal quantities in the system. These non-sinusoidal quantities can create serious harmonic distortions in transmission and distribution systems. In this paper, harmonic generation of a static VAR compensator with thyristor-controlled reactor and effects of the harmonics on steady-state voltage stability are examined for various operational conditions.</p>

				<title>A novel technique for estimation of skew in binary text document images based on linear regression analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0069-0085</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>When a document is scanned either mechanically or manually for digitization, it often suffers from some degree of skew or tilt. Skew-angle detection plays an important role in the ﬁeld of document analysis systems and OCR in achieving the expected accuracy. In this paper, we consider skew estimation of Roman script. The method uses the boundary growing approach to extract the lowermost and uppermost coordinates of pixels of characters of text lines present in the document, which can be subjected to linear regression analysis (LRA) to determine the skew angle of a skewed document. Further, the proposed technique works ﬁne for scaled text binary documents also. The technique works based on the assumption that the space between the text lines is greater than the space between the words and characters. Finally, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology we compare the experimental results with those of well-known existing methods.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0089-0117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article examines the architecture of e-commerce as a set of layers, each supporting the one above it. The layers have clean interfaces, that is, they can be designed independently. We present an architecture with six layers. The lowest layer consists of a physical communication network such as local area network or public switched telephone networks. The next higher layer is the logical layer which describes the protocol used to interconnect communication systems to create internet, intranet and extranet. The services provided over the internet infrastructure, namely, e-mail, world wide web etc., are described in what is called network services layer. It is essential to ensure security of messages, documents etc., which are transmitted using network services. The messaging layer is thus concerned with encryption methods, both private and public key encryption and their applications. We call the layer above this the middleman service, which is concerned with valueadded services offered by intermediaries to enable payment for services received, certify digital signatures, safely transmit documents and provide information on behalf of companies. The topmost layer is the application layer which users see. The major applications are customer-to-business (C2B) e-commerce, business-tobusiness (B2B) e-commerce, customer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce etc. We brieﬂy explain these modes.</p>

				<title>e-Commerce security – A life cycle approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0119-0140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rapid evolution of computing and communication technologies and their standardizations have made the boom in e-commerce possible. Lowering of the cost of operation, increase in the speed of transactions, and easy global reach to customers and vendors have been the reasons for the overwhelming popularity of this new way of commerce. This article examines the issues related to the security of the assets and transactions in the e-commerce components and activities. Since large public money is involved in the transactions, the role of information security and privacy is not exaggerated in this kind of business. After examining the technologies used in e-commerce, the article goes on to identify the security requirement of ecommerce systems from perceived threats and vulnerabilities. Then e-commerce security is viewed as an engineering management problem and a life cycle approach is put forward. How the e-commerce systems can be made secure using the life cycle approach is outlined. The relevant standards and laws are also discussed in the perspective of e-commerce. The article closes with some future research directions and conclusions.</p>

				<title>Trust management for e-transactions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0141-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There has been enormous increase in transactions and cooperativecomputing services on the internet. This is both a technical and a social phenomenon. Transactions and services over the internet have global reach and users, known or unknown to the service provider, might be interested in availing access or participating in the cooperative transaction in a distributed manner. Thus, it is very important for service providers to identify and establish trustworthiness of potential collaborators, which they do by writing contracts (e.g. access control, security policies; the words contract and policy are used interchangeably) without violating the privacy and conﬁdentiality laws that prevail across geographical boundaries. But as the system becomes complex and dynamic, contractual incompleteness arises since it becomes cumbersome to mention potentially large set of outcomes of the user’s choice of action. Trust plays a crucial role in the design of optimal contracts; not all the relevant, valuable information on the user’s choice of action is incorporated in the equilibrium contract. It may also be noted in that traditional transactions, the notion of seeing is believing plays a vital role. However, in e-transactions, this is not the case. The challenge is to see how in such a scenario trust can indeed be generated. Note that the presence of trust facilitates cooperative behaviour and allows for exchange to occur in situations where its absence would preclude trade.</p>
					<p>In this paper, we shall present a comparative analysis of various approaches of trust management in practice that integrates technology with other factors. We shall also bring out the relative deﬁciencies and how these issues are tackled in our ongoing work that facilitates execution of optimal contracts.</p>

				<page>0159-0177</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is a well-known fact that the retail industry always works on razorthin margins and the key to survival lies in optimization of resources both in space and time dimensions as well as maximization of customer satisfaction. Access to timely and even real-time information to a wide variety of channel and trading partners, sales personnel, line managers, store managers etc. is the key to achieving this. Web services technology holds out a lot of promise for the retail industry in this respect. It is a platform-neutral, easy to deploy set of standards for achieving business data and process integration, without going for proprietary point to point connections. It promises to connect the information providers and information consumers across a wide variety of platforms, devices and on an on-demand basis. Being based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles it can also form the enabling service interface layer for other emerging technologies like BAM, BPM, mobile and RFID. In this paper, we attempt to understand information-ﬂow needs in the retail industry and also suggest a roadmap approach by which the retail enterprise could exploit the potential of web services at minimal risk.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Advertising is a critical process for promoting both products and services in global trade. Internet has emerged as a powerful medium for trade and commerce. Online advertising over the internet has increased more than hundredfold since 2001. In the present work, we address problems faced by online advertisement service providers. In this paper, we propose a multi-slot and multi-site combinatorial auction for allocating scarce advertisement slots available on multiple sites. We observe that combinatorial auctions serve as effective mechanisms for allocating advertising slots over the internet. We resort to “ant” systems (ant – social insect/intelligent agent) to solve the above $\mathcal{NP}$-hard combinatorial optimization problem which involves winner-determination in multi-item and multi-unit combinatorial auctions.</p>

				<title>Dynamic pricing models for electronic business</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0231-0256</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dynamic pricing is the dynamic adjustment of prices to consumers depending upon the value these customers attribute to a product or service. Today’s digital economy is ready for dynamic pricing; however recent research has shown that the prices will have to be adjusted in fairly sophisticated ways, based on sound mathematical models, to derive the beneﬁts of dynamic pricing. This article attempts to survey different models that have been used in dynamic pricing. We ﬁrst motivate dynamic pricing and present underlying concepts, with several examples, and explain conditions under which dynamic pricing is likely to succeed. We then bring out the role of models in computing dynamic prices. The models surveyed include inventory-based models, data-driven models, auctions, and machine learning. We present a detailed example of an e-business market to show the use of reinforcement learning in dynamic pricing.</p>

				<title>Pricing strategies for information goods</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0257-0274</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Digital or information goods are becoming the norm across a wide variety of industries including books, music, entertainment, gaming and education. Due to the fact that the marginal cost of producing or reproducing information goods is very low, it is much easier to customise and personalise them for individual users. Furthermore, sellers of these information goods are increasingly using bundling and versioning strategies to appropriate a greater share of the surplus. This paper examines recent research on pricing of information goods with particular focus on customisation, bundling and versioning strategies adopted by information goods providers. The paper highlights both game-theoretic as well as optimisation models that not only provide different perspectives, but also examine issues of information goods pricing at different levels of abstraction and complexity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ubiquitous low-cost connectivity synonymous with the internet has changed the competitive business environment by dissolving traditional sources of competitive advantage based on size, location and the like. In this level playing ﬁeld, ﬁrms are forced to compete on the basis of knowledge. Data mining tools and techniques provide e-commerce applications with novel and signiﬁcant knowledge. This knowledge can be leveraged to gain competitive advantage. However, the automated nature of data mining algorithms may result in a glut of patterns – the sheer numbers of which contribute to incomprehensibility. Importance of automated methods that address this immensity problem, particularly with respect to practical application of data mining results, cannot be overstated. We ﬁrst examine different approaches to address this problem citing their applicability to e-commerce whenever appropriate. We then provide a detailed survey of one important approach, namely interestingness measure, and discuss its relevance in e-commerce applications such as personalization in recommender systems. Study of current literature brings out important issues that reveal many promising avenues for future research. We conclude by reiterating the importance of post-processing methods in data mining for effective and efﬁcient deployment of e-commerce solutions.</p>

				<title>Monte Carlo methods for pricing ﬁnancial options</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0347-0385</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Pricing ﬁnancial options is amongst the most important and challenging  problems in the modern ﬁnancial industry. Except in the simplest cases, the prices of options do not have a simple closed form solution and efﬁcient computational methods are needed to determine them. Monte Carlo methods have increasingly become a popular computational tool to price complex ﬁnancial options, especially when the underlying space of assets has a large dimensionality, as the performance of other numerical methods typically suffer from the ‘curse of dimensionality’. However, even Monte-Carlo techniques can be quite slow as the problem-size increases, motivating research in variance reduction techniques to increase the efﬁciency of the simulations. In this paper, we review some of the popular variance reduction techniques and their application to pricing options. We particularly focus on the recent Monte-Carlo techniques proposed to tackle the difﬁcult problem of pricing American options. These include: regression-based methods, random tree methods and stochastic mesh methods. Further, we show how importance sampling, a popular variance reduction technique, may be combined  with these methods to enhance their effectiveness. We also brieﬂy review the evolving options market in India.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we develop a quadratic programming model for partner selection and planning in integrated supply chain networks embedded with both sell-side and buy-side electronic marketplaces. Such a scenario arises in several  practical applications. In particular, we consider a contract manufacturer who procures components from suppliers through a component marketplace and sells its manufactured sub-assemblies to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), through a sub-assembly marketplace. In these web-enabled supply chains, embedded with upstream and downstream electronic marketplaces, we need methods for online supply-chain partner selection based on pricing and delivery schedules. In this paper, we develop and present such a model that selects partners, synchronizes supply chain activities and optimizes the proﬁt through optimal revenue pricing and cost minimization.</p>

				<title>e-Commerce and supply chains: Modelling of dynamics through fuzzy enhanced high level petri net</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0403-0429</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although information plays a major role in effective functioning of supply chain networks (SCNs), studies that deal speciﬁcally with the dynamics of supply chains are few. This problem is relatively new since fast communications and the means to employ it for effective management of supply chains did not exist till recently. In order to provide a vehicle for dynamic modelling and analysis of supply chain operations in vague and uncertain environments, we propose  a fuzzy enhanced high level petri net (FEHLPN) model. The proposed model captures the capability of petri nets for graphical and analytical representation of dynamic SCNs with the management of uncertain information provided by fuzzy logic. The dynamics associated with two production planning and control policies are modelled, viz. make-to-stock and assemble-to-order in vague and ambiguous situations in electronic commerce environment. A fuzzy set and fuzzy truth-values are attached to an uncertain fuzzy token to model imprecision and uncertainty. The proposed FEHLPN incorporates essential aspects of rule-based systems, such as conservation of facts, refraction, and closed-world assumption.</p>

					<p>Since their inception, e-marketplaces have witnessed a major shakeout and have undergone tremendous change with regard to their business models and products/service offerings. Only a few marketplaces survive, tend to grow and consolidate in this turbulent environment. This development represents an interesting challenge to prevailing institutional theory, which views the performance of organizations as strongly inﬂuenced by the orientation and characteristics of a number of key institutional frameworks. Our research, based on a case survey methodology, attempts to identify the characteristics underlying successful e-marketplaces. Results indicate the success of a marketplace strongly inﬂuenced by number of key institutional frameworks and ﬁrm-level strategies. Ownership and bias, service focus, value impact, market opaqueness, rapidity of response, complementary assets and appropriability, and industry regulations emerge as key variables.</p>

				<page>0445-0462</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In price-sensitive markets, price promotions coupled with an appropriate item replenishment strategy can be effective in controlling the total costs of servicing the market. In supply chains that handle perishable products, inventory management is already a complex problem and the management of products in a dynamic-pricing environment is even more challenging. Monitoring and control of time-sensitive products can be facilitated by the application of radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) technology, which enables non-contact, real-time data collection and efﬁcient interfacing with the management control system in the supply chain. This paper describes an integrated framework for inventory management and pricing in a discrete time (periodic review and ordering) framework, and describes an efﬁcient algorithm, including a new approximation, for the related optimization problem. We then propose a suitable architecture for the application of RFID technology in this context, to realize the potential beneﬁts.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A major assertion in the supply chain management literature is that there is an economic rationale for integration across the boundaries of ﬁrms. The purpose of the paper is to evaluate this fundamental assumption.</p>
					<p>Based on review of the relevant literature and the plethora of empirical evidence, two dominant models of supply chain organization have been found. Research ﬁndings from the literature for each of the collaboration models (viz. at arms length or tighter coupling) are presented. When such conceptual models are mapped to the real world and tested, it is found that what exists is an in-between state of loose coupling between the vendor and customer. We have endeavoured to determine why and conclude that it is the result of a natural equilibrium. Attempts by interested parties to push this to either end (viz. at arms length or tighter coupling) do not result in beneﬁts at acceptable levels for both parties, and hence are unlikely to succeed.</p>
					<p>We advocate that the business context, market forces and behavioural aspects of organizations be well understood before designing an appropriate collaboration framework.</p>

				<title>Models for measuring and predicting shareholder value: A study of third party software service providers</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0475-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, we use the strategic proﬁt model (SPM) and the economic value-added (EVA to measure shareholder value). SPM measures the return on net worth (RONW) which is deﬁned as the return on assets (ROA) multiplied by the ﬁnancial leverage. EVA is deﬁned as the ﬁrm’s net operating proﬁt after taxes (NOPAT) minus the capital charge. Both, RONW and EVA provide an indication of how much shareholder value a ﬁrm creates for its shareholders, year on year.</p>
					<p>With the increasing focus on creation of shareholder value and core competencies, many companies are outsourcing their information technology (IT) related activities to third party software companies. Indian software companies have become leaders in providing these services. Companies from several other countries  are also competing for the top slot. We use the SPM and EVA models to analyse the four listed players of the software industry using the publicly available published data. We compare the ﬁnancial data obtained from the models, and use peer average data to provide customized recommendations for each company to improve their shareholder value. Assuming that the companies follow these rules, we also predict future RONW and EVA for the companies for the ﬁnancial year 2005. Finally, we make several recommendations to software providers for effectively competing in the global arena.</p>

				<title>Hundred years of the boundary layer – Some aspects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0499-0512</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concept of the boundary layer was proposed by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. This concept has allowed prediction of skin friction drag, heat transfer from the wall and separation of the boundary layer, which in turn enables proper design of airplanes, ships, other vehicles and equipment through/around which ﬂuid ﬂow takes place. The centenary of the proposal by Prandtl is being celebrated in various ways. This article is an attempt at presenting some of the developments in boundary layers. The article begins with a brief description of Prandtl’s work.

				<page>0513-0525</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Steady state responses at viscous ﬂuid/ orthotropic micropolar solid interfaces to moving point loads have been studied. An eigenvalue approach using the Fourier transform has been employed to solve the problem. The displacement, microrotation and stress components for the orthotropic micropolar solids so obtained in the physical domain are computed numerically by applying numerical inversion technique. Viscosity and anisotropy effects on normal displacement, normal force stress and tangential couple stress have been shown graphically for a particular model. Some special cases of interest have been presented.</p>

				<title>Heat transfer and thermal stress analysis in grooved tubes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0537-0553</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heat transfer and thermal stresses, induced by temperature differencesin the internally grooved tubes of heat transfer equipment, have been analysed numerically. The analysis has been conducted for four different kinds of internally grooved tubes and three different mean inlet water velocities. Constant temperature was applied from the external surface of the tube. Energy and governing ﬂow equations were solved using ﬁnite difference scheme. Finite element method (FEM) was used to compute the thermal stress ﬁelds. Grooving effects on the thermal stress ratio have been discussed. As a result, maximum thermal stress occurs in the case of $p = d$ for all water inlet velocities. The maximum thermal stress ratio positions inside the tube have been indicated as $MX$ for all investigated cases. In the light of the thermal stress values, various designs can be applied to reduce thermal stress in grooved tubes.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0565-0583</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of two-dimensional static deformation of a monoclinic elastic medium has been studied using the eigenvalue method, following a Fourier transform. We have obtained expressions for displacements and stresses for the medium in the transformed domain. As an application of the above theory, the particular case of a normal line-load acting inside an orthotropic elastic half-space has been considered in detail and closed form expressions for the displacements and stresses are obtained. Further, the results for the displacements for a transversely isotropic as well as for an isotropic medium have also been derived in the closed form. The use of matrix notation is straightforward and avoids unwieldy mathematical expressions. To examine the effect of anisotropy, variations of dimensionless displacements for an orthotropic, transversely isotropic and isotropic elastic medium have been compared numerically and it is found that anisotropy affects the deformation signiﬁcantly.</p>

				<page>0585-0600</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, neutronic investigation of a deuterium–tritium (DT) driven hybrid reactor using ceramic uranium fuels, namely $UC$, $UO_2$ or $UN$ under a high neutron wall load (NWL) of $10 MW/m^2$ at the ﬁrst wall is conducted over a period of 24 months for ﬁssile fuel breeding for light water reactors (LWRs). New substances, namely, Flinabe or $Li_{20}Sn_{80}$ are used as coolants in the fuel zone to facilitate heat transfer out of the blanket. Natural lithium is also utilized for comparison to these two innovative coolants. Neutron transport calculations are performed on a simple experimental hybrid blanket with cylindrical geometry with the help of the SCALE 4·3 System by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with the XSDRNPM code in 238 neutron groups and an $S_8-P_3$ approximation. The investigated blanket using Flinabe or $Li_{20}Sn_{80}$ shows better ﬁssile fuel breeding and fuel enrichment characteristics compared to that with natural lithium which shows that these two innovative coolants can be used in hybrid reactors for higher ﬁssile fuel breeding performance. Furthermore, using a high NWL of $10 MW/m^2$ at the ﬁrst wall of the investigated blanket can decrease the time for fuel rods to reach the level for charging in LWRs.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0611-0623</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We compare here the accuracy, stability and wave propagation properties of a few Galerkin methods. The basic Galerkin methods with piecewise linear basis functions (called G1FEM here) and quadratic basis functions (called G2FEM) have been compared with the streamwise-upwind Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) method for their ability to solve wave problems. It is shown here that when the piecewise linear basis functions are replaced by quadratic polynomials, the stencils become much larger (involving ﬁve overlapping elements), with only a very small increase in spectral accuracy. It is also shown that all the three Galerkin methods have restricted ranges of wave numbers and circular frequencies over which the numerical dispersion relation matches with the physical dispersion relation - a central requirement for wave problems. The model one-dimensional convection equation is solved with a very ﬁne uniform grid to show the above properties. With the help of discontinuous initial condition, we also investigate the Gibbs’ phenomenon for these methods.</p>

					<p>This study presents an investigation of transient local entropy generation rate in pulsating turbulent ﬂow through an externally heated pipe. The ﬂow inlet to the pipe pulsates at a constant period and amplitude, only the velocity oscilates. rate in pulsating turbulent ﬂow through an externally heated pipe. The ﬂow inlet to the pipe pulsates at a constant period and amplitude, only the velocity oscilates. The simulations are extended to include different pulsating ﬂow cases (sinusoidal ﬂow, step ﬂow, and saw-down ﬂow) and for varying periods. The ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds are computed numerically with the help of the Fluent computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) code, and a computer program developed by us by using the results of the calculations performed for the ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds. In all investigated cases, the irreversibility due to the heat transfer dominates. With the increase of ﬂow period, the highest levels of the total entropy generation rates increase logarithmically in the case of sinusoidal and saw-down ﬂow cases whereas they are almost constant and the highest total local entropy is also generated in the step case ﬂow. The Merit number oscillates periodically in the pulsating ﬂow cases along the ﬂow time. The results of this study indicate that ﬂow pulsation has an adverse effect on the ratio of the useful energy transfer rate to the irreversibility rate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We design and investigate the performance of fuzzy logic-controlled (FLC) active suspensions on a nonlinear vehicle model with four degrees of freedom, without causing any degeneration in suspension working limits. Force actuators were mounted parallel to the suspensions. In this new approach, linear combinations of the vertical velocities of the suspension ends and accelerations of the points of connection of the suspension to the body have been used as input variables. The study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic controller for active suspension systems. Suspension working space degeneration is the most important problem in various applications. Decreasing the amplitudes of vehicle body vibrations improves ride comfort. Body bounce and pitch motion of the vehicle are presented both in time domain when travelling over a ramp-step road proﬁle and in frequency domain. The results are compared with those of uncontrolled systems. At the end of this study, the performance and the advantage of the suggested approach and the improvement in ride comfort are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Laminated composites with ceramic front layers and metallic or composite  backing layers have gained attractiveness as lightweight armours, as they exhibit the same ballistic performance with lower areal densities as compared to steels. Drop-weight testing (DWT) has potential for evaluating the low velocity impact behaviour of materials. This testing gives signiﬁcant ideas and information about failure mechanisms and behaviour of materials under low velocity impact. In this study, DWT of alumina/aluminum laminated composites was done in order to investigate the effects of lamination type, density with respect to area and mechanical  property of backing material on the low velocity ballistic performance of these composites. The experimental results showed that the laminated composite with ceramic front layer and aged-aluminum alloy as backing layer was the most effective among different investigated specimens against low velocity impact loads.</p>

				<page>0687-0698</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Drying of particles (pieces) in a ﬂuidized bed affords better quality of end products, especially for better product structure and its shorter reconstitution time. Fluid-bed drying of different fruit particles has been investigated. Starting water content varies from grape berries 81·5% and peach 87·7% to apricot 86·9%. The temperature of ﬂuidization varies from $70^\circ C$ to $100^\circ C$ at air velocities from $0·98 ms^{−1}$ to $5·2 ms^{−1}$. The product should be dried fruit with 10% to 14% of water content with good rehydration quality that varies from 8 to 20. Experimental data have been measured, relevant values have been calculated and a mathematical model introduced. The results have shown that drying of fruit in a ﬂuidized bed produces dry fruit particles of improved quality in a much shorter time, with improved rehydration times and qualities, than in continuous belt-driers that are generally used.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the application of induction motor stator current spectral analysis (MCSA) for detection of rolling element bearing damage from the outer raceway. In this work, MCSA and vibration analysis are applied to induction motor to detect outer raceway defects in faulty bearings. Data acquisition, recording,and fast fourier transform (FFT) algorithms are done by using the LabVIEW programming language. Experimental results verify the relationship between vibration  analysis and MCSA, and identify the presence of outer raceway bearing defects in induction machines. This work also indicates that detecting fault frequencies by motor currents is more difﬁcult than detecting them by vibration analysis. The use of intensive resolution FFT is recommended in MCSA for detecting faults easily. Reinstalling a faulty bearing can alter the characteristic frequencies and it is difficult to compare results from different bearings or even from the same bearing in different installations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The quality of river water or other surface waters is detrimentally affected by the contaminants carried by the rainfall runoff in urban areas. The control of pollution moved by rainfall runoff is achieved by installing outlets and small retention basins in stormwater collection systems, thereby allowing only a certain amount of rainfall water to overﬂow and leading the remaining to treatment plants. This study analyses the effect of concentration time on surface water pollution caused by rainfall runoff. For this purpose, a linear $S$-curve is assumed for the ﬂow hydrograph arising from the collection system, based on parameters of rainfall considered and the catchment area. An independent code is developed to analyse such a system and this is applied to an urban area using nine-year single-discrete rainfall records of Izmir Station, Turkey. The system is capable of tackling situations where there is only a basin or a basin with outlet.</p>

					<p>Non-Newtonian ﬂuid ﬂow in a pipe system is considered and a third grade non-Newtonian ﬂuid is employed in the analysis. The velocity and temperature distributions across the pipe are presented. Entropy generation number due to heat transfer and ﬂuid friction is formulated. The inﬂuences of non-Newtonian parameter and Brinkman number on entropy generation number are examined. It is found that increasing the non-Newtonian parameter reduces the ﬂuid friction in the region close to the pipe wall. This in turn results in low entropy generation with increasing non-Newtonian parameter. Increasing Brinkman number enhances the ﬂuid friction and heat transfer rates; in which case, entropy number increases with increasing Brinkman number.</p>

				<title>Numerical analysis of choked converging nozzle ﬂows with surface roughness and heat ﬂux conditions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0031-0046</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Choked converging nozzle ﬂow and heat transfer characteristics are numerically investigated by means of a recent computational model that integrates the axisymmetric continuity, state, momentum and energy equations. To predict the combined effects of nozzle geometry, friction and heat transfer rates, analyses are conducted with sufﬁciently wide ranges of covergence half angle, surface roughness and heat ﬂux conditions. Numerical ﬁndings show that inlet Mach and Nusselt numbers decrease up to 23.1% and 15.8% with surface heat ﬂux and by 15.13% and 4.8% due to surface roughness. Considering each convergence half angle case individually results in a linear relation between nozzle discharge coefﬁcients and exit Reynolds numbers with similar slopes. Heat ﬂux implementation, by decreasing the shear stress values, lowers the risks due to wear hazards at upstream sections of ﬂow walls; however the ﬁnal 10% downstream nozzle portion is determined to be quite critical, where shear stress attains the highest magnitudes. Heat transfer rates are seen to increase in the streamwise direction up to 2.7 times; however high convergence half angles, heat ﬂux and surface roughness conditions lower inlet Nusselt numbers by 70%, 15.8% and 4.8% respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents two different new excitation current supplies based on power electronics for an existing conventional welding converter. The proposed circuits are simulated using Lab-VIEW 1200 AI and a PC based system. In the expressions for winding currents the dynamic inductances are used to take into account the saturation in the core of the winding. The experimental circuits are implemented and tested. The percentage peak-to-peak ripple currents are calculated for both simulation and experimental results and for both circuit conﬁgurations.

					<p>Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulniﬁcus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and several  other relatedVibrio species show distinctly similar two-chromosomal genome organization. However, the modes of pathogenicity are very different among these species, and this is largely attributed to externally acquired genetic elements. We develop some statistical methods to determine these external genetic elements or genomic islands in genomes based on their differential oligonucleotide usage patterns compared to the rest of the genome. Genomic islands identiﬁed by these unsupervised statistical methods include integron and pathogenicity islands. After statistical determination of the genomic islands, we investigate their gene contents and their possible association with the pathogenic behaviour of the corresponding Vibrio species. These investigations lead to observations that are of evolutionary and biological signiﬁcance.</p>

					<p>Wireless networks in which the node locations are random are best modelled as random geometric graphs (RGGs). In addition to their extensive application in the modelling of wireless networks, RGGs ﬁnd many new applications and are being studied in their own right. In this paper we ﬁrst provide a brief introduction to the issues of interest in random wireless networks. We then discuss some recent results for one-dimensional networks with the nodes distributed uniformly in $(0, z)$.We then discuss some asymptotic results for networks in higher dimensions when the nodes are distributed in a ﬁnite volume. Finally we discuss some recent generalisations in considering non uniform transmission ranges and non uniform node distributions. An annotated bibliography of some of the recent literature is also provided.</p>

					<p>We consider the problem of determining a model for a given system on the basis of experimental data. The amount of data available is limited and, further, may be corrupted by noise. In this situation, it is important to control the complexity of the class of models from which we are to choose our model. In this paper, we ﬁrst give a simpliﬁed overview of the principal features of learning theory. Then we describe how the method of regularization is used to control complexity in learning. We discuss two examples of regularization, one in which the function space used is ﬁnite dimensional, and another in which it is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our exposition follows the formulation of Cucker and Smale. We give a new method of bounding the sample error in the regularization scenario, which avoids some difﬁculties in the derivation given by Cucker and Smale.</p>

					<p>Data mining is concerned with analysing large volumes of (often unstructured) data to automatically discover interesting regularities or relationships which in turn lead to better understanding of the underlying processes. The ﬁeld of temporal data mining is concerned with such analysis in the case of ordered data streams with temporal interdependencies. Over the last decade many interesting techniques of temporal data mining were proposed and shown to be useful in many applications. Since temporal data mining brings together techniques from different ﬁelds such as statistics, machine learning and databases, the literature is scattered among many different sources. In this article, we present an overview of techniques of temporal data mining. We mainly concentrate on algorithms for pattern discovery in sequential data streams. We also describe some recent results regarding statistical analysis of pattern discovery methods.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The constant search for new materials has provided impetus to research in piezoelectric materials. An anti-plane problem for a cracked unbounded two-dimensional poled piezoelectric plate has been investigated. The crack rims open  on account of shear mechanical forces applied at the remote boundary and inplane electric displacement ﬁeld prescribed at the inﬁnite boundary. Thus the crack yields both mechanically and electrically. Consequently, a plastic zone and a saturation zone protrude ahead of each tip of the crack. These developed zones are in turn closed by applying yield point shear stress at the rims of plastic zone and normal closing saturation limit displacement on the rims of saturation zones. Two cases are investigated when (i) the developed saturation zone length exceeds that of the developed plastic zone, and (ii) saturation zone length is smaller than that of the plastic zone. Fourier integral transform method is used in each case to obtain the length of plastic zone and saturation zone. Closed form analytic expressions are obtained in each case. Crack opening displacement and potential drop across the rims of the crack are also obtained. The effect of mechanical loads on crack closure in the presence of electric ﬁeld is investigated and vice-versa. Also energy release rate expressions are obtained for both the cases.</p>

The bottleneck operation in the generic preﬂow algorithm is the number of noncancelling pulls. Using the scaling technique (i.e. selecting the active nodes with sufﬁciently large deﬁcits), we reduce the number of noncancelling pulls to $O(n^2 \log \bar{c})$ and obtain an $O(nm+n^2 \log \bar{c})$ algorithm.</p>

					<p>This paper describes an active ﬁlter topology to improve the performance of hysteresis direct torque control (HDTC) of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM). The ﬁlter topology consists of an active ﬁlter and two RLC ﬁlters, and is connected to the main power circuit through a $1:1$ transformer. The active ﬁlter is characterized by detecting the harmonics in the motor phase voltages and injecting equivalent harmonic voltages to produce almost sinusoidal voltage waveform to the motor terminals. The active ﬁlter uses hysteresis voltage controller while the motor main circuit uses hysteresis direct torque control.  The simulation results of this combined control structure show considerable torque ripple reduction in the steady state range and adequate dynamic torque performance as well as considerable harmonic voltage and EMI noise reduction.</p>

				<page>0259-0276</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reliable person identiﬁcation is a key factor for any safety measure. Unlike other biometrics such as the palm, retina, gait, face and ﬁngerprints, the characteristic of the iris is stable in a person’s lifetime. Iris patterns are chaotically distributed and well suited for recognizing persons throughout their lifetime with a single conscription. This paper proposes a new approach to person recognition based on iris patterns, which works with indoor outdoor conditions, spectacles contact lens wearing persons and diseased eyes. A challenge-response method is used for eye aliveness checking that puts off artiﬁcial sources from entering the iris database. The proposed algorithm can work with 84 statistical iris features that are extracted from an individual. Space and time complexity of the proposed approach is lesser than the existing methods. This algorithm has been implemented and results have been analysed on 2500 different iris patterns acquired in India under different real-time conditions. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method has been easily espoused in elections, bank transactions and other security applications.</p>

This recording medium continues to exist in spite of considerable development in speech processing systems (SPS), because of its ability to record spoken/dictated text at high speeds of more than 120 words per minute. Hence, scope exists for exploiting this potential of PSL in present SPS.</p>

				<title>Random eigenvalue problems revisited</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0293-0314</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The description of real-life engineering structural systems is associated with some amount of uncertainty in specifying material properties, geometric parameters, boundary conditions and applied loads. In the context of structural dynamics it is necessary to consider random eigenvalue problems in order to account for these uncertainties. Within the engineering literature, current methods to deal with such problems are dominated by approximate perturbation methods. Some exact methods to obtain joint distribution of the natural frequencies are reviewed and their applicability in the context of real-life engineering problems is discussed. A new approach based on an asymptotic approximation of multi-dimensional integrals is proposed. A closed-form expression for general order joint moments of arbitrary numbers of natural frequencies of linear stochastic systems is derived. The proposed method does not employ the ‘small randomness’ assumption usually used in perturbation based methods. Joint distributions of the natural frequencies are investigated using numerical examples and the results are compared with Monte Carlo simulation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A stochastic averaging procedure for obtaining the probability density function (PDF) of the response for a strongly nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom system, subjected to both multiplicative and additive random excitations is presented. The procedure uses random Van Der Pol transformation, Ito’s equation of limiting diffusion process and stochastic averaging technique as outlined by Zhu and others. However, the equations are rederived in generalized form and arranged in such a way that the procedure lends itself to a numerical computational scheme using FFT. The main objective of the modiﬁcation is to consider highly irregular nonlinear functions which cannot be integrated in closed form and also to solve problems where analytical expressions for probability density function cannot be obtained. The procedure is applied to obtain the PDF of the response of Dufﬁng oscillator subjected to additive and multiplicative random excitations represented by rational power spectral density functions (PSDFs). The results are veriﬁed by digital simulation. It is shown that the procedure provides results which compare very well with those obtained from simulation analysis not only for wide-band excitations but also for very narrow-band excitations, which are weak (when normalized with respect to mass of the system).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Strength reduction factors (SRFs) continue to play a key role in obtaining design forces from elastic design spectra (via response modiﬁcation factors) in ductility-based earthquake-resistant design. Despite several years of sustained research efforts, it has not been conclusively shown how SRF for a given single-degree-of-freedom structural system depends on various source and site parameters. A parametric study is carried out here for the explicit dependence of SRF spectrum (describing variation of SRF with system period for a given ductility demand) on strong motion duration, earthquake magnitude, geological site conditions, and epicentral distance in case of (non-degrading) elasto-plastic oscillators. For this, scaled response spectra are considered for different combinations of earthquake magnitude, site conditions and epicentral distance, and SRF spectra are generated from 1274 accelerograms recorded in western USA after making those compatible with each of these spectra. It is shown that there is no clear and signiﬁcant dependence of SRF spectrum on strong motion duration. Further, the parametric dependence on earthquake magnitude, site conditions, and epicentral distance broadly conforms to the trends reported by earlier investigations. In particular, this study conﬁrms that the dependence of SRF spectra on earthquake magnitude should not be ignored.</p>

It is veriﬁed using the Monte Carlo simulation technique, and is found to be very efﬁcient and accurate. Most sources of nonlinearlity and uncertainty can be explicitly incorporated in the formulation. The ﬂexibility of connections, represented by moment-relative rotation $(M–\theta )$ curves, is addressed. After the Northridge earthquake of 1994, several improved steel connections were proposed. Structural Sesimic Design Associates (SSDA) tested several full-scale proprietory slotted web beam–column connections. The authors suggested $(M–\theta )$ curves for this connection using actual test data. Behaviours of steel frames, assuming the connections are fully restrained, partially restrained, consisting of pre- and post-Northridge connections are evaluated and compared. Desirable features of the post-Northridge connections observed during testing are analytically conﬁrmed. Laterally weak steel frame is then strengthened with concrete shear walls. Capabilities and the advanced nature of the method are demonstrated with the help of realistic examples.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear dynamics of a sliding beam on two supports under sinusoidal excitation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0383-0397</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study deals with the nonlinear dynamics associated with large deformation of a beam sliding on two-knife edge supports under external excitation. The beam is referred to as a Gospodnetic–Frisch-Fay beam, after the researchers who reported its static deformation in closed form. The freedom of the beam to slide on its supports imparts a nonlinear characteristic to the force-deﬂection response. The restoring elastic force of the beam possesses characteristics similar to those of the roll-restoring moment of ships. The Gospodnetic–Frisch-Fay exact solution is given in terms of elliptic functions. A curve ﬁt of the exact solution up to eleventh-order is constructed to establish the governing equation of motion under external excitation. The dynamic stability of the unperturbed beam is examined for the damped and undamped cases. The undamped case reveals periodic orbits and one homoclinic orbit depending on the value of the initial conditions. The response to a sinusoidal excitation at a frequency below the linear natural frequency is numerically estimated for different excitation amplitude and different values of initial conditions covered by the area of the homoclinic orbit. The safe basins of attraction are plotted for different values of excitation amplitude. It is found that the safe region of operation is reduced as the excitation amplitude increases.</p>

				<title>Monte Carlo ﬁlters for identiﬁcation of nonlinear structural dynamical systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0399-0427</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of identiﬁcation of parameters of nonlinear structures using dynamic state estimation techniques is considered. The process equations are derived based on principles of mechanics and are augmented by mathematical models that relate a set of noisy observations to state variables of the system. The set of structural parameters to be identiﬁed is declared as an additional set of state variables. Both the process equation and the measurement equations are taken to be nonlinear in the state variables and contaminated by additive and (or) multiplicative Gaussian white noise processes. The problem of determining the posterior probability density function of the state variables conditioned on all available information is considered. The utility of three recursive Monte Carlo simulation-based ﬁlters, namely, a probability density function-based Monte Carlo ﬁlter, a Bayesian bootstrap ﬁlter and a ﬁlter based on sequential importance sampling, to solve this problem is explored. The state equations are discretized using certain variations of stochastic Taylor expansions enabling the incorporation of a class of non-smooth functions within the process equations. Illustrative examples on identiﬁcation of the nonlinear stiffness parameter of a Dufﬁng oscillator and the friction parameter in a Coulomb oscillator are presented.</p>

				<title>Estimation of failure probabilities of linear dynamic systems by importance sampling</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0429-0443</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An iterative method for estimating the failure probability for certain time-variant reliability problems has been developed. In the paper, the focus is on the displacement response of a linear oscillator driven by white noise. Failure is then assumed to occur when the displacement response exceeds a critical threshold. The iteration procedure is a two-step method. On the ﬁrst iteration, a simple control function promoting failure is constructed using the design point weighting principle. After time discretization, two points are chosen to construct a compound deterministic control function. It is based on the time point when the ﬁrst maximum of the homogenous solution has occurred and on the point at the end of the considered time interval. An importance sampling technique is used in order to estimate the failure probability functional on a set of initial values of state space variables and time. On the second iteration, the concept of optimal control function can be implemented to construct a Markov control which allows much better accuracy in the failure probability estimate than the simple control function. On both iterations, the concept of changing the probability measure by the Girsanov transformation is utilized. As a result the CPU time is substantially reduced compared with the crude Monte Carlo procedure.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0445-0461</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The response of a structural system to white noise excitation (delta-correlated) constitutes a Markov vector process whose transitional probability density function (TPDF) is governed by both the forward Fokker–Planck and backward Kolmogorov equations. Numerical solution of these equations by ﬁnite element and ﬁnite difference methods for dynamical systems of engineering interest has been hindered by the problem of dimensionality. In this paper numerical solution of the stationary and transient form of the Fokker–Planck (FP) equation corresponding to two state nonlinear systems is obtained by standard sequential ﬁnite element method (FEM) using $C^\circ$ shape function and Crank–Nicholson time integration scheme. The method is applied to Van-der-Pol and Dufﬁng oscillators providing good agreement between results obtained by it and exact results. An extension of the ﬁnite difference discretization scheme developed by Spencer, Bergman and Wojtkiewicz is also presented. This paper presents an extension of the ﬁnite difference method for the solution of FP equation up to four dimensions. The difﬁculties associated in extending these methods to higher dimensional systems are discussed.</p>

				<title>Enhancement of damage indicators in wavelet and curvature analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0463-0486</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Damage in a structural element induces a small perturbation in its static or dynamic displacement proﬁle which can be captured by wavelet analysis. The paper presents the wavelet analysis of damaged linear structural elements using $DB4$ or $BIOR6·8$ family of wavelets. An expression is developed for computing the natural frequencies of a damaged beam using ﬁrst order perturbation theory. Starting with a localized reduction of $EI$ at the mid-span of a simply supported beam, damage modelling is done for a typical steel beam element. Wavelet analysis is performed for this damage model for displacement, rotation and curvature mode shapes as well as static displacement proﬁles. Damage indicators like displacement, slope and curvature are magniﬁed under higher modes. Instantaneous step-wise linearity is assumed for all the nonlinear elements. A localization scheme with arbitrararily located curvature nodes within a pseudo span is developed for steady state dynamic loads, such that curvature response and damages are maximized and the scheme is numerically tested and proved.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Heave and pitch motions of road vehicle structures affect the comfort and the safety of passengers. Excitation of these vertical vibrations is due to road surface roughness. Road vehicle structures are modelled as mechanical systems characterized by their inertia, damping and stiffness, and represented as state equations. This paper deals with the inﬂuence of random road proﬁles on the vertical dynamics of road vehicles characterized by stochastic processes. Switching from road proﬁle displacement to road proﬁle velocity results in white noise excitation facilitating mathematical analysis. Some fundamentals of power spectral density analysis and covariance analysis are reviewed. A quarter car model is used to show the advantages of the covariance analysis resulting immediately in standard variations characterizing the vehicle’s performance.</p>

				<page>0505-0514</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has been known for some time that distorted ﬁnite elements produce relatively (and, sometimes, dramatically) poor results. This has been related to the completeness condition. In this paper, we investigate this issue and propose that the abstract mathematical viewpoint represented by the completeness condition is actually a statement of the physical need for a ﬁnite element computation to recover accurate stresses in the metric space. This follows from the projection theorem describing ﬁnite element analysis which shows that the stresses computed by the displacement ﬁnite element procedure are a best approximation of the true stresses at an element as well as global level. The simplest possible element is used to elucidate the principles.</p>

				<title>Effects of adding illegal storeys to structural systems</title>

				<page>0515-0526</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Earthquakes in Turkey are frequently occurring disasters, causing much loss of life and property. It is tragic indeed that earthquakes should share the agenda with amnesty laws for illegal buildings. Illegal buildings are those constructed without authorization, legal bureaucratic sanction and, in most cases, without normal engineering control and checks. Buildings may become illegal for a variety of reasons. The very prospect of a waiver bill for illegal buildings spurs further illegal construction. The status of illegal buildings may legally change in time. What is an illegal building today may well be legal tomorrow under these circumstances.</p>
					<p>The present study deals with two different kinds of building: one is the framed building and the other has shear-wall frame. The capacity ratios, storey drifts and natural periods for the legally approved buildings and the effects of illegal or legal additional ﬂoors on these values are compared. It is determined that these buildings with illegal storeys should be strengthened and retroﬁtted by providing cast in-situ reinforced concrete shear walls.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mechanical properties of cereal (starch-based) extrudates are perceived by the ﬁnal consumer as criteria of quality. We investigate one of the important characteristics of extrudates, mechanical hardness, which is one of the main texture parameters. Texture quality has an inﬂuence on taste sensory evaluation, and thus on the acceptability of the product. Characteristics that have great inﬂuence on acceptability are crispness, elasticity, hardness and softness.</p>
					<p>These attributes are narrowly related to, and affected by, the process parameters. A 2-level–4-factor factorial experimental design was used to investigate the influence of temperature of expansion, screw speed, feed moisture content and feed rate, and their interactions, on the mechanical hardness of extrudates. Feed moisture content, screw speed and temperature are found to inﬂuence, while feed rate does not have signiﬁcant effect on extrudate hardness.</p>
					<p>Mechanical properties of specimens were measured by means of compression testing, based on the concept of nominal stress, using a universal testing machine and special grips that were constructed for this purpose.</p>

A very novel aspect is that it includes the analysis of the effect of bulk modulus on system control. Simulation results demonstrates that bulk modulus should be considered as a variable parameter to obtain a more realistic model. Additionally, a PID controller is insufﬁcient in presence of variable bulk modulus, whereas a fuzzy controller provides robust angular velocity control.</p>

					<p>Aerodynamic forces and fore-body convective surface heat transfer rates over a $60^\circ$ apex-angle blunt cone have been simultaneously measured at a nominal Mach number of 5·75 in the hypersonic shock tunnel $HST2$. An aluminum model incorporating a three-component accelerometer-based balance system for measuring the aerodynamic forces and an array of platinum thin-ﬁlm gauges deposited on thermally insulating backing material ﬂush mounted on the model surface is used for convective surface heat transfer measurement in the investigations. The measured value of the drag coefﬁcient varies by about $\pm6%$ from the theoretically estimated value based on the modiﬁed Newtonian theory, while the axi-symmetric Navier–Stokes computations overpredict the drag coefﬁcient by about 9%. The normalized values of measured heat transfer rates at $0^\circ$ angle of attack are about 11% higher than the theoretically estimated values. The aerodynamic and the heat transfer data presented here are very valuable for the validation of CFD codes used for the numerical computation of ﬂow ﬁelds around hypersonic vehicles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fly ash particles entrained in the ﬂue gas from boiler furnaces in coal-ﬁred power stations can cause serious erosive wear on steel surfaces along the ﬂow path. Such erosion can signiﬁcantly reduce the operational life of the boiler components. A mathematical model embodying the mechanisms of erosion on behaviour, has been developed to predict erosion rates of coal-ﬁred boiler components  at different temperatures. Various grades of steels used in fabrication of boiler components and published data pertaining to boiler ﬂy ash have been used for the modelling. The model incorporates high temperature tensile properties of the target metal surface at room and elevated temperatures and has been implemented in an user-interactive in-house computer code (EROSIM–1), to predict the erosion rates of various grades of steel. Predictions have been found to be in good agreement with the published data. The model is calibrated with plant and experimental data generated from a high temperature air-jet erosion-testing facility. It is hoped that the calibrated model will be useful for erosion analysis of boiler components.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Conventionally, Marx generators are used for the production of short duration, high voltage pulses but since many discharge gap switches are utilized for stepping up the voltage, there are many disadvantages. Here, an alternative and much simpler technique for the multiplication of nanosecond high voltage pulses has been presented in which multiplication takes place by switching single spark gap providing voltage gain of $‘nxV’$ where $n$ is the subsequent number of stages. Stepped up high voltage pulse with ﬁxed voltage gain of deﬁned shape with fast rise time and good ﬂat top is produced without using additional pulse-forming network. Its operation has been made repetitive by switching single spark gap. Multipurpose use, low cost, small size, light weight (weighing less than $50 kg$) and portability are the additional beneﬁts of the system. The reported nanosecond pulser has been made by cascading three stages of Blumlein. To cross check its performance the parasitic impedance of the system has been evaluated to realize its adverse effect on the voltage gain and pulse shape. Also its operation has been simulated by PSPICE circuit simulator program and good agreement has been obtained between simulated and experimental results. Applications of this pulse generator include X-ray generation, breakdown tests, ion implantation, streamer discharge studies and ultra wideband generation, among others.</p>

					<p>A single-frame X-ray framing camera has been set up for fast imaging of X-ray emissions from pulsed plasma sources. It consists of two parts, viz. an X-ray pin-hole camera using an open-ended microchannel plate (MCP) detector coupled to a CCD camera, and a high voltage short duration gate pulse for the MCP. The camera uses a $10-\mu m$ pin-hole aperture for imaging on the MCP detector with a magniﬁcation of $6X$. The high voltage pulser circuit generates a pulse of variable duration from 5 to $30 ns$ (at 70% of peak amplitude) with variable amplitude from $800 V$ to $1·25 kV$, and is triggered through a laser pulse synchronized with the event to be recorded. The performance of the system has been checked by recording X-ray emission from a laser-produced copper plasma. A reduction factor of $\sim6·5$ is seen in the dark current contribution as the MCP gate pulse is decreased from $250\mu s$ to $5 ns$ duration.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Advances in personal computers (PCs) have increased interest in computer-based road-design systems to provide rapid evaluation of alternative alignments. Optimization techniques can provide road managers with a powerful tool that searches for large numbers of alternative alignments in short spans of time. A forest road optimization model, integrated with two optimization techniques, was developed to help a forest road engineer in evaluating alternative alignments in a faster and more systematic manner. The model aims at designing a path with minimum  total road costs, while conforming to design speciﬁcations, environmental requirements, and driver safety. To monitor the sediment production of the alternative alignments, the average sediment delivered to a stream from a road section was estimated by using a road erosion/delivery model. The results indicated that this model has the potential to initiate a new procedure that will improve the forest road-design process by employing the advanced hardware and software capabilities of PCs and modern optimization techniques.</p>

					<p>The ﬁndings of the present work yield useful information about the MalaysianPangasius sutchi concerning the marketing sector from the point of view of shelf life and storage temperature in the range of 0 to $10^\circ C$. A fresh batch of typical samples, were stored similarly in four chillers of different temperatures for a period of 28 days. During the course of storage, the samples were periodically subjected to $pH$ and sensory tests performed by trained panelists. Experimental observations were analysed and regressed to develop three correlations. The ﬁrst one was between the sensory tests and the storage time and temperatures, while the second one related $pH$ values to storage time and temperatures. Finally, a correlation between sensorial and $pH$ values was developed as well. The ﬁrst correlation is presented in tabular form to yield a simple guide to ﬁsh retailers, by which quality and shelf life of the displayed ﬁsh commodity may be estimated.</p>

				<title>An investigation into design of fair surfaces over irregular domains using data-dependent triangulation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0645-0659</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Design of fair surfaces over irregular domains is a fundamental problem in computer-aided geometric design (CAGD), and has applications in engineering sciences (in aircraft, automobile, ship science etc.). In the design of fair surfaces over irregular domains deﬁned over scattered data, it was widely accepted till recently that the classical Delaunay triangulation be used because of its global optimum property. However, in recent times it has been shown that for continuous piecewise linear surfaces, improvements in the quality of ﬁt can be achieved if the triangulation pattern is made dependent upon some topological or geometric property of the data set or is simply data dependent. The fair surface is desired because it ensures smooth and continuous surface planar cuts, and these in turn ensure smooth and easy production of the surface in CAD/CAM, and favourable resistance properties. In this paper, we discuss a method for construction of $C^1$ piecewise polynomial parametric fair surfaces which interpolate prescribed $\mathfrak{R}^3$ scattered data using spaces of parametric splines deﬁned on $\mathfrak{R}^3$ triangulation. We show that our method is more speciﬁc to the cases when the projection on a $2-D$ plane may consist of triangles of zero area, numerically stable and robust, and computationally inexpensive and fast. Numerical examples dealing with surfaces approximated on plates, and on ships have been presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of the paper is to obtain an optimal setting of turning process parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) resulting in an optimal value of the feed force when machining $EN24$ steel with $TiC$-coated tungsten-carbide inserts. The effects of the selected turning process parameters on feed force and the subsequent optimal settings of the parameters have been accomplished using Taguchi’s parameter design approach. The results indicate that the selected process parameters signiﬁcantly affect the selected machining characteristics. The results are conﬁrmed by further experiments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Non-Newtonian ﬂuid ﬂow in annular pipes is considered and the entropy generation due to ﬂuid friction and heat transfer in them is formulated. A third-grade ﬂuid is employed to account for the non-Newtonian effect, while the Reynolds model is accommodated for temperature-dependent viscosity. Closed-form solutions for velocity, temperature, and entropy ﬁelds are presented. It is found that entropy generation number increases with reducing non-Newtonian parameter, while it is the reverse for the viscosity parameter, which is more pronounced in the region close to the annular pipe inner wall.</p>

				<title>A level set formulation for the numerical simulation of impact of surge fronts</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0697-0707</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we present a level set-based algorithm for the solution of incompressible two-phase ﬂow problems. The technique is applied to the numerical simulation of impact of two surge fronts resulting from the collapse of liquid columns. The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are solved using a projection method based on forward Euler time-stepping. The Hamilton–Jacobi type equation for the transport of level set function is carried out by a high resolution  ﬁfth-order accurate WENO scheme. For efﬁcient implementation of the WENO scheme we have proposed grid staggering for the level set function. The solution of the pressure Poisson equation is obtained using an efﬁcient preconditioned conjugate gradient method. It is shown that the present formulation works very well for large density and viscosity ratios. For the purpose of validation, we have simulated small-amplitude free sloshing of liquid in a container and the well-known two-dimensional broken-dam problem of Martin and Moyce. Simulations of impact of surge fronts have been carried out and the results are discussed.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0709-0719</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Non-unique solutions of ﬂow and temperature ﬁeld are reported here for the ﬁrst time for non-similar ﬂows given by the laminar boundary layer equations for combined-convection ﬂow past a vertical ﬂat plate. The solution of the boundary layer equation for natural convection constitutes the self-similar solution whose perturbation with respect to the small parameter$(\varepsilon)$, which is inversely proportional to the square root of the Richardson number$(G_x)$, provides the nonsimilar solution. Solutions obtained by the shooting method indicate two sets for the self-similar solution $(\varepsilon = 0) –$ one of them showing positive velocity everywhere inside the shear layer (well-known oft-reported physical result). The other self-similar solution shows that recirculation in the outer part of the shear layer may not be physical – as it has not been experimentally demonstrated so far. In contrast, the perturbative part of the non-similar solution $(\varepsilon \neq 0)$ is seen to be either convergent or divergent depending upon the choice of integration domain of the shear layer equations – bringing forth the question of the validity of such perturbation procedures and possible stability of the basic solution itself.</p>

				<title>Dynamic active earth pressure on retaining structures</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0721-0730</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Earth-retaining structures constitute an important topic of research in civil engineering, more so under earthquake conditions. For the analysis and design of retaining walls in earthquake-prone zones, accurate estimation of dynamic earth pressures is very important. Conventional methods either use pseudo-static approaches of analysis even for dynamic cases or a simple single-degree of freedom model for the retaining wall–soil system. In this paper, a simpliﬁed two-degree of freedom mass–spring–dashpot (2-DOF) dynamic model has been proposed to estimate the active earth pressure at the back of the retaining walls for translation modes of wall movement under seismic conditions. The horizontal zone of inﬂuence on dynamic earth force on the wall is estimated. Results in terms of displacement, velocity and acceleration-time history are presented for some typical cases, which show the ﬁnal movement of the wall in terms of wall height, which is required for the design. The non-dimensional design chart proposed in the present study can be used to compute the total dynamic earth force on the wall under different input ground motion and backﬁll conditions. Finally, the results obtained have been compared with those of the available Scott model and the merits of the present results have been discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the effect of a gravel-bed in a compound bend (similar to sinusoidal top view) of a natural river (Zayandehrud River ﬂowing through Isfahan, Iran) has been investigated for ﬂow resistance analysis, measuring the velocity with a micro current meter. The data were analysed and the following observations were made.</p>
					<p>In a compound bend, the law of the wall can be valid for up to 66% of the ﬂow depth from the bed. The parabolic law is the most effective method for the determination of shear velocity. Based on the existing criteria for verifying the equilibrium boundary layer, the ﬂow cannot be in equilibrium. The shear stress distribution and the sediment transport parameters have considerable inﬂuence on resistance to ﬂow. Froude number and the ﬂow depth relative to the representative gravel size have little effect on the ﬂow resistance estimation.</p>

				<title>Hydrodynamic modelling of ﬂow over a spillway using a two-dimensional ﬁnite volume-based numerical model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0743-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spillway ﬂow, a classical problem of hydraulics, is generally a gravity-driven free surface ﬂow. Spillway ﬂows are essentially rapidly varying ﬂows near the crest with pronounced curvature of the streamlines in the vertical direction. Two processes simultaneously occur in the ﬂow over the crest, that is, formation and gradual thickening of the turbulent boundary layer along the proﬁle, and gradual increase in the velocity and decrease in the depth of main ﬂow. Spillway hydrodynamics can be obtained through physical modelling or numerical modelling. physical modelling of spillways is expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming. The main difﬁculties in solving the spillway problem numerically are: rapidly varying ﬂow, existence of both subcritical and supercritical ﬂows, development of turbulent boundary layers, unknown free surface and air entrainment. Numerical simulation of such ﬂows over spillways in all ﬂow regimes is a challenging task. This paper describes a numerical model and its application to a case study to investigate the hydraulic characteristics of ﬂow over spillway crest proﬁles by simulating the velocity distribution, pressure distribution and discharge characteristics. Results of the numerical modelling are compared with those from the physical modelling and found to be satisfactory.</p>

				<title>Handwriting segmentation of unconstrained Oriya text</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0755-0769</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Segmentation of handwritten text into lines, words and characters is one of the important steps in the handwritten text recognition process. In this paper we propose a water reservoir concept-based scheme for segmentation of unconstrained Oriya handwritten text into individual characters. Here, at ﬁrst, the text image is segmented into lines, and the lines are then segmented into individual words. For line segmentation, the document is divided into vertical stripes. Analysing the heights of the water reservoirs obtained from different components of the document, the width of a stripe is calculated. Stripe-wise horizontal histograms are then computed and the relationship of the peak–valley points of the histograms is used for line segmentation. Based on vertical projection proﬁles and structural features of Oriya characters, text lines are segmented into words. For character segmentation, at ﬁrst, the isolated and connected (touching) characters in a word are detected. Using structural, topological and water reservoir concept-based features, characters of the word that touch are then segmented. From experiments we have observed that the proposed “touching character” segmentation module has 96·7% accuracy for two-character touching strings.</p>

				<title>Flow diagnostics using ﬁbre optics</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0007-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Research in the area of ﬂow diagnostics using ﬁbre-optics started in our laboratory in early 1998. The ﬁrst-ever multi-component wind tunnel balance in the world, working with ﬁbre-optic sensors was built and demonstrated in 1999. Since then, several new applications of the technique in the area of ﬂuid dynamic load measurements have been tried successfully. Very recently, ﬁbre-optic sensors have been effectively used for underwater applications, where conventional measurements are relatively very difﬁcult. Since, different physical perturbations affect optical power ﬂowing in a ﬁbre in different ways, unique signatures can be obtained which allow absolute or relative measurement of the incident disturbances. Immunity to electromagnetic or radio frequency interference, high temperature capability, low fatigue, high sensitivity, small size, good corrosion resistance and the capability to embed sensors within the model surface are some of the very attractive features of ﬁbre-optic based instrumentation systems. In this paper, we describe the results of experiments of aerodynamic load measurements at hypersonic speeds (Mach 8·35 and 7·0) and studies carried out recently in a water tunnel over a lifting hypersonic vehicle with a 2-component ﬁbre-optic strain-gauge balance.</p>

				<title>Resection methodology for PSP data processing: Recent experiences in NAL</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0019-0027</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>PSP data processing, which primarily involves image alignment and image analysis, is a crucial element in obtaining accurate PSP results. There are two broad approaches to image alignment: the algebraic transformation technique, often called image-warping technique, and resection methodology, which uses principles of optical photogrammetry. Resection is found to have higher resolution, especially when large gradients in pressure or signiﬁcantly three-dimensional regions have to be resolved, and even with ﬂat models when the camera angles are large. A processing software based on these methodologies has been successfully developed and validated and is currently in use at the Experimental Aerodynamics Division of the National Aerospace laboratories, Bangalore.</p>
					<p>In this paper, we show the merits of resection methodology through two examples: (a) a wing-body model in transonic ﬂow $(M = 0·8)$ and (b) a simple delta wing in low supersonic ﬂow $(M = 1·8)$. The PSP system utilized for both the cases involve Optrod-$B1$ paint, a specially designed UV lamp for excitation and two scientific grade CCD cameras for imaging. Typical results are shown using both the algebraic transformation approach and resection methodology.</p>

				<title>Wavelet diagnostics for detection of coherent structures in instantaneous turbulent ﬂow imagery: A review</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0029-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A review of work over the last decade shows that $2D$ wavelet techniques applied on ﬂow imagery can provide powerful insights into the nature and lifecycle of coherent structures (the latter through wavelet movies) in turbulent shear ﬂows. The advantage of wavelet techniques in often being able to infer the nature of coherent motion from a single image is emphasized. The techniques are ﬁrst calibrated by using them on well-known results in the turbulent mixing layer. They are then applied to jets and plumes, and it is shown how off-source heating in such ﬂows can disrupt the coherent structures in the unheated ﬂow. A suitably reduced version of the present method, using discrete wavelet transforms on signals from a ﬁnite array of sensors, could be a useful diagnostic tool in near-real-time detection of coherent structures or patterns for the purpose of selecting appropriate control signals to the actuators in a ﬂow-control system.</p>

				<title>The dynamics of surge in compression systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0043-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In air-compression systems, instabilities occur during operation close to their peak pressure-rise capability. However, the peak efﬁciency of a compression system lies close to this region of instability. A surge is a violent mode of instability where there is total breakdown of ﬂow in the system and pressure-rise capability is lost drastically. Generally, all compression systems operate with a margin deﬁned as the ‘surge margin’, and, consequently, system operational efﬁciency is lower. It is of interest to study compression-system surge to understand its dynamics in order to operate compression systems close to the instability for achieving high efﬁciency safely without encountering surge. Unsteady pressure data from a compression system, captured during surge oscillations, reveal many aspects of ﬂow physics and are analysed to understand the surge dynamics of the system. A set of controlled experiments was conducted with a simple desktop experimental test set-up and essential aspects of surge dynamics have been characterised.</p>

				<title>Organised structures in wall turbulence as deduced from stability theory-based methods</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0051-0064</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In earlier work, we have explored the relevance of hydrodynamic stability theory to fully developed turbulent wall ﬂows. Using an extended Orr-Summerfeld Equation, based on an anisotropic eddy-viscosity model, it was shown that there exists a wide range of unstable wave numbers (wall modes), which mimic some of the key features of turbulent wall ﬂows. Here we present experimental conﬁrmation for the same. There is good qualitative and quantitative agreement between theory and experiment. Once the dominant coherent structure is obtained from stability theory, control of turbulence would be the next logical step. As shown, the use of a compliant wall shows considerable promise.</p>
					<p>We also present some theoretical work for bypass transition (Klebanoff/K-modes), wherein the receptivity of a laminar boundary layer to a vortex sheet in the freestream has been studied. Further, it is shown that triadic interaction between K-modes, $2D$ TS waves and $3D$ TS waves can lead to rapid algebraic growth. A similar mechanism seems to carry over to inner wall structures in wall turbulence and perhaps this is the “root cause” for sustenance of turbulence.</p>

				<page>0065-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper is a review of some of our recent work on the effect of wall heating on the stability of laminar ﬂow in a channel. The summary of our results, some of them unexpected, is as follows. Viscosity stratiﬁcation has very little effect on transient growth, whereas it results in linear mode stabilising or destabilising by an order of magnitude. It has hitherto been accepted that heat diffusivity does not affect stability. This is however true only for linear instability, transient growth is affected by an order of magnitude. Unusually, the growth is spanwise-independent and not in the form of streamwise vortices. It is also shown that ﬂow is destabilised by secondary modes as the viscosity ratio increases. However, the viscosity ratio has no role in the selection of the pattern of $\Lambda$ vortices.</p>

				<page>0083-0092</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Separation control has received considerable emphasis in literature both owing to fundamental ﬂow physics and technological applications. Flow separation generally leads to increased energy losses, instability and so on, and its control is essential to improve aerodynamic performance. Here a brief review is presented of three broad strategies for separation control: these include methods that involve energization of the boundary layer upstream of separation, those that involve altering the bubble ﬂow or dead air zone, and those that may inﬂuence the shear layer reattachment directly. Examples from recent research in our laboratories are reviewed and it is suggested that direct manipulation of the reattachment process could lead to effective control/management.</p>

					<p>This study reports control of compressible dynamic stall through management of its unsteady vorticity using a variable droop leading edge (VDLE) airfoil. Through dynamic adaptation of the airfoil edge incidence, the formation of a dynamic stall vortex was virtually eliminated for Mach numbers of up to 0·4. Consequently, the leading edge vorticity ﬂux was redistributed enabling retention of the dynamic lift. Of even greater importance was the fact that the drag and pitching moment coefﬁcients were reduced by nearly 50%. The camber variations introduced when the leading edge was drooped are explained to be the source of this beneﬁt. Analysis of the peak vorticity ﬂux levels allowed the determination of minimum necessary airfoil adaptation schedule.</p>

				<title>Laminar separation bubbles: Dynamics and control</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0103-0109</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work is an experimental investigation of the dynamics and control of the laminar separation bubbles which are typically present on the suction surface of an aerofoil at a large angle of attack. A separation bubble is produced on the upper surface of a ﬂat plate by appropriately contouring the top wall of the wind tunnel. First, a basic (unforced) separation bubble is obtained to set a benchmark for further experiments. Parametric study is done where the reference velocity is decreased to quantify its effect on the aspect ratio of the bubble. It is found that with decrease in Reynolds number, the height of the bubble increases at a greater rate than the length. This feature could be useful in characterising separation bubbles especially from the point of view of low Reynolds number aerofoil design. Artiﬁcial disturbance is introduced at two different initial amplitudes (inﬁnitesimal and ﬁnite) upstream of separation location and hotwire anemometry is used to trace the wave packet as it is advected downstream. The evolution of wave packets is seen to take place in two distinct stages. Finite amplitude forcing causes periodic quenching of the bubble. Interestingly, even an inﬁnitesimally small forcing is seen to modify and thereby control the separation bubble.</p>

				<title>On wake response to asymmetric blowing in spurts from a blunt trailing edge</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0111-0122</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present investigation, a technique has experimentally been evolved with the aim to control the unsteady wake dominated by periodic vortexshedding. The technique uses pulsating surface blowing that is applied asymmetrically just before separation from the blunt trailing edge of a thick aerofoil model. Thus, momentum is injected in spurts in only one of the two separated shear layers. The control parameters are the mass ﬂow rate and the forcing frequency of the pulsating blowing. The technique is particularly effective in suppressing the vortex-shedding when the blowing is moderate and the forcing frequency is twice the natural vortex-shedding frequency. As a consequence of injecting momentum in spurts, there is a signiﬁcant saving in mass ﬂow required to achieve a condition of the momentumless wake. In spite of the initial conditions being strongly asymmetric, the ﬂow pattern in the wake was observed to quickly assume a remarkable symmetry.</p>

				<title>Turbulence and drag control in jet and wake ﬂows</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0133-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Structures of plane and circular jets were modiﬁed by using active, passive and an active–passive (hybrid) combination to investigate the phenomenon of turbulence control using hot-wire anemometry. Active control was achieved by exciting the ﬂow by using either an acoustic speaker or vibrating piezoceramic elements, whereas passive control was achieved by placing a slender object such as a thin wire or a ring, a mesh or a honeycomb section downstream of the nozzle exit plane. Turbulence enhancement and suppression in plane- and circular-jet mixing layers could be achieved by employing active techniques, whereas passive techniques essentially yielded turbulence reduction. For a circular cylinder, a significant reduction in drag was obtained by placing a cylinder of small diameter upstream of the main cylinder. The total drag of the two cylinders was smaller than that of a single cylinder alone. Hot-wire measurements indicate signiﬁcant changes to the downstream ﬂow structure associated with the observed drag reduction. Our investigations indicate that different types of modiﬁcation and excitation can yield different but useful outcomes.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0145-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Experimental data on acoustic pressure measurements obtained over a wide range of conditions is reported for two simple geometries that are commonly studied for their combustion dynamics behaviour. These geometries are the conﬁned bluff-body and the conﬁned backward-facing steps. The data indicate regimes of ﬂow-acoustic lock-on that signiﬁes the onset of combustion instability, marked by the excitation of high-amplitude discrete tones of sound in the combustor. The highspeed chemiluminescence imaging of the combustion zone indicates heat-release-rate ﬂuctuations occurring at the same frequencies as observed in the acoustic spectra. Attention is then devoted to the data obtained under cold-ﬂow conditions to illustrate distinctly different behaviour than when combustion instability occurs, contrary to the commonly held view that the combustion process does not alter the underlying ﬂuid mechanical processes under low-Mach number conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, free vibration of beams with different boundary conditions is analysed within the framework of the third-order shear deformation theory. The boundary conditions of beams are satisﬁed using Lagrange multipliers. To apply the Lagrange’s equations, trial functions denoting the deﬂections and the rotations of the cross-section of the beam are expressed in polynomial form. Using Lagrange’s equations, the problem is reduced to the solution of a system of algebraic equations. The ﬁrst six eigenvalues of the considered beams are calculated for different thickness-to-length ratios. The results are compared with the previous results based on Timoshenko and Euler–Bernoulli beam theories.</p>

				<title>Indian practice on estimation of scour around bridge piers—A comment</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0187-0197</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Well-laid foundation is mostly provided in road and railway bridges in India over large and medium-sized rivers. The age-old Lacey–Inglis method is used for estimation of the design scour depth around bridge elements such as pier, abutment, guide bank, spur and groyene. Codal provisions are seen to produce too large a scour depth around bridge elements resulting in bridge sub-structures that lead to increased construction costs. Limitations that exist in the codes of practice are illustrated in this paper using examples. The methods recently developed for estimation of the scour are described. New railway and road bridges are required to be built in large numbers in the near future across several rivers to strengthen such infrastructure in the country. It is strongly felt that provisions in the existing codes of practice for determination of design scour depth require immediate review. The present paper provides a critical note on the practices followed in India for estimating the design scour depth.</p>

				<page>0199-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Accurate estimation of the maximum possible depth of scour at bridge abutments is important in decision-making for the safe depth of burial of footings. Besides, investigation of the geometric features of scour holes around abutments provides useful information for the degree of scour counter-measure to be implemented against excessive scouring. Experiments have been performed to investigate time-dependent characteristics of scour holes around vertical wall abutments under clear water conditions with uniform bed materials. Temporal variations of scour depth and scour contours were measured. Using this information, an empirical relation was developed for temporal variation of scour depth. Additional relations were also derived for time-dependent volume and surface area of the scour holes around abutments. The ﬁndings of this study may provide useful informatoin for preliminary design of abutment footings and placement details of armoring counter-measures, such as riprap.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Investigations conducted based on seismic soil-structure interaction analysis of a massive concrete structure supported on a raft foundation are presented in this paper. Linear transient dynamic analysis is carried out using ﬁnite element method and imposing transmitting boundary conditions at far ﬁeld of layered elastic half-space. Analysis is conducted in two phases, namely: (i) free-ﬁeld analysis of the layered half-space and (ii) seismic analysis of the structure by including soil-structure interaction effects. In the ﬁrst phase, a simple and novel technique is used to establish free-ﬁeld excitation at a depth in the half-space. In the second phase, seismic soil-structure interaction analysis of the structure is carried out for the free-ﬁeld excitation determined in phase-I. Stress resultants experienced by the raft and the stresses at the interface between the rock and raft are evaluated. Critical examination of the results indicates tensile stresses of considerable magnitude at few locations in the rock-raft interface. Typical stress responses at the interface are presented and discussed in the paper.</p>

				<title>TCP with header checksum option for wireless links: An analytical approach towards performance evaluation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0253-0275</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>TCP performs poorly in wireless mobile networks due to large bit error rates. Basically, the TCP sender responds to these losses as if they were due to congestion in the network, and reduces the congestion window unnecessarily. In earlier work, it has been shown that adding a TCP header checksum is very useful in differentiating between congestion loss and corruption loss. With the modiﬁed TCP, receivers can explicitly indicate corruption of received packets by generating “Explicit Loss Notiﬁcations (ELNs).” This paper focuses on an analytical study of this modiﬁed TCP protocol. We derive an expression for the probability of a receiver generating successful ELN, assuming a generic link layer protocol for data transfer over wireless links. Next, we develop an analytical approach for TCP throughput evaluation under the modiﬁed scheme. We compare the throughput results obtained by analysis and simulation, and ﬁnd very close agreement between the two sets. We also compare the performance of the modiﬁed scheme with the standard NewReno TCP, and ﬁnd considerable improvement in data throughput over wireless links.</p>

					<p>The burden on health-related issues due to unplanned urban policies is higher despite the present knowledge of interventions and availability of current technologies. This burden could increase substantially, given the rapid growth in urban populations and the application of partial or misguided solutions to urban transport problems. Part of the reason is the failure to consider holistically the health, social and environment consequences and the related costs of individual travel choices and government policies in the ﬁeld of trafﬁc and mobility. Urban transport-related issues and its impact on health, environment, costs and beneﬁts are discussed in this paper.</p>

				<title>Success and failures in urban transport planning in Europe—understanding the transport system</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0293-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Technological determinism has become a kind of religion for many people since it appears to offer solutions for societal problems as never before in history. Transport is one of the fascinating technology branches developed during the last 200 years. Effortless movement over long distances has become possible for car users as long as cheap fossil energy is available. However, the effect of fast transport on urban structures and society was not taken into account when developing these technical means. Technologists and economists have used indicators for expected beneﬁts of these fast transport modes without taking into account the real system effects on society and urban structures. Plausible assumptions and hopes instead of scientiﬁc understanding of the complex system are used in practice. In contradiction to widely held beliefs of transportation planners, there is actually no growth of mobility if counted in number of trips per person per day, no time saving by increasing speed in the system, and no real freedom of modal choice. Modal choice is dependent on physical and other structures, the artiﬁcial environment built by urban planners, transport experts and political decisions. The core hypothesis of traditional urban and transport planning ‘growth of mobility’, ‘travel time saving by increasing speed’ and ‘freedom of modal choice’ are myths and do not exist in the real urban and transport system. This is the reason why urban planning and transport planning based on traditional non-scientiﬁc assumptions is creating continuously not only more transport problems, but also environmental and social as well as economic problems all over the world, where these principals are applied. Urban transport planning in Europe, understanding the transport system and the solutions are presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Trafﬁc planning for non-homogeneous trafﬁc</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0309-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Trafﬁc on Indian roads (both urban and inter-urban) consists of a variety of vehicles. These vehicles have widely different static and dynamic characteristics. The trafﬁc is also very different from homogeneous trafﬁc which primarily consists of motorized vehicles. Homogeneous trafﬁc follows strict lane discipline as compared to non-homogeneous trafﬁc. Western trafﬁc planning methodologies mostly address the concerns of homogeneous trafﬁc and therefore often prove inadequate in solving problems involving non-homogeneous trafﬁc conditions as found in Indian cities. This paper presents studies conducted on non-homogeneous trafﬁc. Section 1 presents a methodology to verify the continuity equation, the basic block of any trafﬁc planning analysis. In § 2, the methodology developed is applied to modify the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 density method to derive passengercar equivalencies (PCEs) or units (PCUs) for heavy vehicles and recreational vehicles. These PCUs appear as ‘ET’ and ‘ER’ in HCM tables. The density method assumes motorized, four-wheeler trafﬁc, i.e., homogeneous traffic,  and does not include motorized three-wheelers, motorized two-wheelers, and non-motorized trafﬁc often present on Indian highways. By modifying the density method to represent non-homogeneous trafﬁc, which includes signiﬁcant percentages of motorized, three-wheelers, motorized two-wheelers, and non-motorized trafﬁc entities, one can derive more accurate passenger car units for Indian conditions. Transport professionals can use these PCU values for accurate capacity, safety, and operational analysis of highways carrying non-homogeneous trafﬁc.</p>

				<title>Should bus commuting be subsidized for providing quality transport services? – A case for Delhi</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0329-0345</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Urban transport has serious problems that are symptoms of the general process of rapid urbanization and environmental degradation. Policymakers in general and urban economists in particular have paid little attention to public transport system pricing leading to the absence of a ﬁnancially viable, self-supporting urban transport system.</p>
					<p>In this paper, we report a partial equilibrium model developed by us, which captures transport tax reforms in the presence of certain transport externalities. Our theoretical model shows that the question of public transport subsidies to reduce congestion and provide quality transport services depends on three factors: (a) the extent to which such subsidies induce people to switch from private transport to public transport; (b) if the price elasticity of current users of public transport is higher, there may be a sharp rise in public transport ridership as a reaction to increased subsidies, which will have an undesirable effect; and (c) there is the danger that subsidies will cause a loss in productive efﬁciency.</p>
					<p>The numerical model of our paper for Delhi shows that the cross price elasticity of public transport demand with respect to the price of private transport is signiﬁcant (0·63) in the off-peak period whereas the same in the peak period is somewhat low (0·16) and the combined effect of these elasticities will result in a considerable modal shift in favour of bus transport demand (19%) if the price of public transport were to be subsidized and private transport were to be priced optimally. Even without subsidy, the modal shift will be signiﬁcant (18%), if the under-priced private transport modes are optimally priced keeping the current bus prices constant. This paper shows that there will be signiﬁcant welfare gains in both these scenarios.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Open window buses without air-conditioning are a major mode of urban and inter-city transport in most countries. High occupancy combined with hot and humid conditions makes travel in these buses quite uncomfortable. In this study air ﬂow through a bus has been studied that could be the basis for low cost and ecofriendly methods of increasing passenger comfort and possibly reduce drag. The aerodynamics of such a road vehicle has not been studied as previous investigations have been conﬁned to vehicles with closed windows that present a smooth exterior to air ﬂow. Using a $1:25$ scaled Perspex model of an urban bus in Delhi, ﬂow visualization was performed in a water channel. The Reynolds numbers were onetenth of a real bus moving at $10 m/s$. Smoke and tuft visualizations were also performed on an urban bus at $40 km/h$. Numerical simulations were performed at the actual Reynolds number. Even though there were Reynolds number differences, the broad features were similar. Air enters the bus from the rear windows, moves to the front (relative to the bus) and exits from the front windows. Inside air velocity relative to the bus is about one-tenth of the free-stream velocity. The ﬂow is highly three-dimensional and unsteady.</p>

				<title>Prediction of trafﬁc fatalities and prospects for mobility becoming sustainable-safe</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0365-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The macroscopic trend of road trafﬁc fatalities in any motorized country is described and predicted by the product of rather well ﬁtting functions of time for the exponential decay of fatality risk per unit of trafﬁc volume and the S-shaped Gompertz function of trafﬁc volume growth. This product deﬁnes a single-peaked development of road trafﬁc deaths, where its peak reaches earlier the sooner and faster a nation or region motorizes massively. Since in developing countries long series of trafﬁc volume data are absent, another model for the ﬁt and prediction of road trafﬁc fatalities for developing countries is used, based on the relationships of income level per capita with road trafﬁc mortality. Also this model implies that at some point in time road trafﬁc deaths will start declining for ever, also worldwide. After empirically derived corrections for missing or incomplete data and police under-reporting, it is estimated that 1·2 million deaths and almost 8 million serious injuries are caused by road trafﬁc worldwide in 2000. Using realistic income level predictions the new income-dependent model predicts markedly later and higher fatality peaks than the veriﬁed time-dependent model. It might be assumed that the developing countries could learn faster to increase their road safety by knowledge transfer from developed countries. Four prediction scenarios are speciﬁed for modiﬁed income-dependent models of road trafﬁc death and serious injury developments up to 2050. Depending on the scenario the world total of road fatalities begins to reduce soon or only after 2035 with a global peak of about 1·8 million road trafﬁc deaths, where the national fatality reduction starts later the lower the national income per capita is. Without the potentially achievable learning scenario the road fatality reductions in developed countries may not be enough to compensate the road fatality increases in developing countries, while road fatality increases may even occur after 2060 in countries with the lowest levels of income per capita.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The evolution of experimental biomechanics and crash injury research is summarized brieﬂy to show that they both play a major role in mitigating traffic deaths and injuries. Historically, the subject has been based largely in western countries and thus focused on vehicle occupants, whereas some 80% of trafﬁc casualties in the world are outside the vehicle as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. The subject is close to the regulatory process which controls vehicle design and is thus heavily inﬂuenced by government and industry, yet it is now in an expanding period because of new techniques to replicate the human frame’s response to impact forces. New knowledge is likely to emerge from addressing population variations and combining real world accident investigations with experimental biomechanics. The application of impact biomechanics to the vulnerable road users is of particular importance.</p>

					<p>Finite element models of the head and helmet were used to study contact forces during frontal impact of the head with a rigid surface. The ﬁnite element model of the head consists of skin, skull, cerebro-spinal ﬂuid (CSF), brain, tentorium and falx. The ﬁnite element model of the helmet consists of shell and foam liner. The foam is taken as elasto-plastic, the brain is assumed to be viscoelastic and all other components are taken as elastic. The contact forces and coup pressures with helmet on the head are much lower than in the absence of the helmet. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effect of liner thickness and density on the contact forces, pressures and energy absorption during impact. For $4 ms^{−1}$ velocity, expanded poly styrene (EPS) foam of density $24 kg m^{−3}$ gave the lowest contact forces and for the velocities considered, thickness of the foam did not affect the contact forces.</p>

				<page>0459-0478</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rollover propensity of a three-wheeled scooter taxi used extensively on SE Asian roads is analysed in this report. A rigid body mathematical model was used to simulate increasing steer, NHTSA $J$-turn, and Road Edge Recovery maneuvers. The anomaly between public perception of the rollover susceptibility and available crash data has been resolved through ﬁnite element (FE) simulation. The optimum conﬁguration of the vehicle and seating arrangement for varying numbers of passengers was determined. The safety of occupants and pedestrians in impact events was analysed through simulation in MADYMO$^{\text{TM}}$, and cost effective solutions to improve safety were identiﬁed.</p>

				<title>Heuristic algorithms for scheduling heat-treatment furnaces of steel casting industries</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0479-0500</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper addresses a research problem of scheduling parallel, nonidentical  batch processors in the presence of dynamic job arrivals, incompatible job-families and non-identical job sizes. We were led to this problem through a realworld application involving the scheduling of heat-treatment operations of steel casting. The scheduling of furnaces for heat-treatment of castings is of considerable interest as a large proportion of the total production time is the processing times of these operations. In view of the computational intractability of this type of problem,  a few heuristic algorithms have been designed for maximizing the utilization of heat-treatment furnaces of steel casting manufacturing. Extensive computational experiments were carried out to compare the performance of the heuristics with the estimated optimal value (using the Weibull technique) and for relative effectiveness among the heuristics. Further, the computational experiments show that the heuristic algorithms proposed in this paper are capable of obtaining near (statistically estimated) optimal utilization of heat-treatment furnaces and are also capable of solving any large size real-life problems with a relatively low computational effort.</p>

				<title>Hybrid LES – Review and assessment</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0501-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the late eighties and up to the beginning of nineties computation of turbulent ﬂows is mostly dominated by RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes Simulation) type modelling. During the last few years URANS (Unsteady RANS) and LES (Large Eddy Simulation) type of approaches have been attempted with some success. Yet, there have been many difﬁculties when LES is applied to practical engineering problems and to high Reynolds number ﬂows as energy dissipating eddies become really small and mesh resolution required for a reasonably resolved LES approaches that of DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation). An alternative solution suggested was to combine RANS and LES, which in general referred to as Hybrid LES. There have been many proposals for combining RANS and LES in different ways. In this article, some of the issues involved in performing hybrid LES reported in the recent literature is brieﬂy reviewed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems have been effectively developed for the recognition of printed characters of non-Indian languages. Efforts are on the way for the development of efﬁcient OCR systems for Indian languages, especially for Kannada, a popular South Indian language. We present in this paper an OCR system developed for the recognition of basic characters (vowels and consonants) in printed Kannada text, which can handle different font sizes and font types. Hu’s invariant moments and Zernike moments that have been progressively used in pattern recognition are used in our system to extract the features of printed Kannada characters. Neural classiﬁers have been effectively used for the classification of characters based on moment features. An encouraging recognition rate of 96·8% has been obtained. The system methodology can be extended for the recognition of other south Indian languages, especially for Telugu.</p>

				<page>0535-0544</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The CFD analysis of ﬂow and temperature distribution in heating ovens used in bakery shop, to keep the foodstuffs warm, is attempted using ﬁnite element technique. The oven is modelled as a two-dimensional steady state natural convection heat transfer problem. Effects of heater location and total heat input on temperature uniformity of foodstuffs are studied. Placing the heater at the bottom of the oven improves the air circulation rate by 17 times and 10 times than that at the top and side of the oven. But the top location provides better uniformity in foodstuff temperature than the other cases. Side location is not preferable. In the present ovens, the heating elements are located at the top. The analysis shows that if heaters are located at the bottom along with additional ﬂow guidance arrangements, energy efﬁcient oven conﬁguration can be obtained.</p>

				<title>Inﬂuence of decelerating ﬂow on incipient motion of a gravel-bed stream</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0545-0559</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An experimental study on incipient motion of gravel-bed streams under steady-decelerating ﬂow is presented. Experiments were carried out in a ﬂume with two median grain sizes, $d_{50} = 16·7 mm$ for a ﬁxed-bed case and $d_{50} = 8 mm$ for a mobile bed case. In addition, an effort is made to determine a simpliﬁed method for the estimation of bed shear stress in decelerating ﬂow over ﬁxed and mobile beds for use in ﬁeld situations. From the observation of eleven ﬁxed-bed and nine mobile-bed velocity proﬁles, it is revealed that the parabolic law method (PLM) and the Reynolds stress method are comparable for estimation of shear velocity in general. Also, the results show that the shear stress distribution adopts a convex form over ﬁxed and mobile beds. Due to this form the critical Shields parameter value for decelerating ﬂow is less than the reported values in literature.</p>
					<p>This paper supports Bufﬁngton &amp; Montgomery (1997) statement that less emphasis should be given on choosing a universal shields parameter, and more emphasis should be given on choosing defendable values based on ﬂow structure.</p>

				<title>Hybrid neural network model for the design of beam subjected to bending and shear</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0577-0586</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is no direct method for design of beams. In general the dimensions of the beam and reinforcement are initially assumed and then the interaction formula is used to verify the suitability of chosen dimensions. This approach necessitates few trials for coming up with an economical and safe design. This paper demonstrates the applicability of Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) for the design of beams subjected to moment and shear. A hybrid neural network model which combines the features of feed forward neural networks and genetic algorithms has been developed for the design of beam subjected to moment and shear. The network has been trained with design data obtained from design experts in the ﬁeld. The hybrid neural network model learned the design of beam in just 1000 training cycles. After successful learning, the model predicted the depth of the beam, area of steel, spacing of stirrups required for new problems with accuracy satisfying all design constraints. The various stages involved in the development of a genetic algorithm based neural network model are addressed at length in this paper.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0597-0617</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, three-dimensional fuel–air mixing inside a conventional spark ignition engine cylinder is simulated under direct injection conditions. The motivation is to explore retroﬁtting of conventional engines for direct injection to take advantage of low emissions and high thermal efﬁciency of the direct injection concept. Fuel–air mixing is studied at different loads by developing and applying a model based on the Lagrangian-drop and Eulerian-ﬂuid (LDEF) procedure for modelling the two-phase ﬂow. The Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model for modelling the hollow cone spray and appropriate models for droplet impingement, drag and evaporation are used. Moving boundary algorithm and two-way interaction between both phases are implemented. Fuel injection timing and quantity is varied with load. Results show that near-stoichiometric fuel–air ratio region is observed at different locations depending on the load. The model developed serves to predict the fuel–air mixing spatially and temporally, and hence is a useful tool in design and optimization of direct injection engines with regards to injector and spark plug locations. Simulations over a range of speed and load indicate the need for a novel ignition strategy involving dual spark plugs and also provide guidelines in deciding spark plug locations.</p>

					<p>In this two part paper, we provide a survey of recent and emerging topics in wireless networking. We view the area of wireless networking as dealing with problems of resource allocation so that the various connections that utilise the network achieve their desired performance objectives. In the ﬁrst part of the paper, we ﬁrst survey the area by providing a taxonomy of wireless networks as they have been deployed. Then, we provide a quick tutorial on the main issues in the wireless ‘physical’ layer, which is concerned with transporting bits over the radio frequency spectrum. Then, we proceed to discuss some resource allocation formulations in CDMA (code division multiple access) cellular networks and OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) networks.</p>
					<p>In the second part of the paper, we ﬁrst analyse random access wireless networks and pay special attention to 802·11 (Wi-Fi) networks. We then survey some topics in ad hoc multihop wireless networks, where we discuss arbitrary networks, as well as some theory of dense random networks. Finally, we provide an overview of the technical issues in the emerging area of wireless sensor networks.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Acidic attack represents a topic of increasing signiﬁcance, owing to the spread of damages of concrete structures in both urban and industrial areas. Cement type is an important factor affecting performance of cement based materials in an aggressive environment. The goal of this study was to compare the acid resistance of a pozzolanic cement (CEM IV-A/32·5) with Portland cement (CEM I 32·5) that was made from the same clinker. For this purpose, $50 mm$ mortar cubes were prepared with two different kinds of cement according to TS EN 196-1. After 28 days of hardening, the samples were immersed into four different concentrations of hydrochloric, nitric and sulfuric acid solutions for a period of 120 days. The changes in weight loss and compressive strength values for each acid solution within the test period were recorded. The acid resistance of mortars made from Portland cement was better than the pozzolanic cement incorporated samples after 120 days of acid attack.</p>

				<title>LQG controller designs from reduced order models for a launch vehicle</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0014</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The suppression of liquid fuel slosh motion is critical in a launch vehicle (LV). In particular, during certain stages of the launch, the dynamics of the fuel interacts adversely with the rigid body dynamics of the LV and the feedback controller must attentuate these effects. This paper describes the effort of a multivariable control approach applied to the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) during a certain stage of its launch. The fuel slosh dynamics are modelled using a pendulum model analogy. We describe two design methodologies using the Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) technique. The novelty of the technique is that we apply the LQG design for models that are reduced in order through inspection alone. This is possible from a perspective that the LV could be viewed as many small systems attached to a main body and the interactions of some of these smaller systems could be neglected at the controller design stage provided sufﬁcient robustness is ensured by the controller. The ﬁrst LQG design is carried out without the actuator dynamics incorporated at the design stage and for the second design we neglect the slosh dynamics as well.</p>

				<title>Assessment of autonomous phase unwrapping of isochromatic phase maps in digital photoelasticity</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photoelasticity is the only whole-ﬁeld experimental technique which can analyse both $2-D$ and $3-D$ elasticity problems. In digital photoelasticity one gets two phase maps, one corresponding to principal stress direction (isoclinic) and the other corresponding to principal stress difference (isochromatic). The phase maps for both isoclinics and isochromatics are to be unwrapped differently for obtaining continuous phase values. Autonomous phase unwrapping is one of the challenging issues and this paper focuses on recent advances on isochromatic phase map unwrapping. A comparative study of different autonomous phase unwrapping algorithm is done by solving a bench mark problem and a stress frozen slice with cut-outs. The need for domain delimiting in addition to domain masking is brought out while using autonomous phase unwrapping algorithms.</p>

In calculations, both material and geometrical non-linearity have been considered. Horizontal and vertical deﬂections magnitudes were calculated throughout Euler–Bernoulli curvature-moment relationship assuming different arc lengths. Vertical deﬂections were calculated by using Runge–Kutta method. More simple and easily understandable results have been obtained compared to the previous studies about the issue and compatible values have been obtained for most of the compared values.</p>

					<p>This paper deals with the free vibration of Timoshenko columns with attached masses having rotary inertia. The support of the model is elastically restrained against rotation. The concept of ﬁxity factor is used to deﬁne the stiffness of the elastic connection relative to that of the column. The governing equation of the column elements is solved by applying the separation of variables method in the transfer matrix method (TMM) algorithm. The same problems are solved, also, by ﬁnite element method (FEM) algorithm in which the matrices in equation of motion are obtained for Timoshenko column, and the results are compared with the ones of TMM. The comparison graphs are presented in numerical analysis to show the effectiveness of the considered methods, and it is resulted that FEM gives closer results to TMM.</p>

				<title>Emission control with route optimization in solid waste collection process: A case study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0071-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solid waste collection processes are usually carried out by using trucks with diesel engine. In solid waste collection process, the trucks emit to environment different emissions from its exhausts. For this reason, in solid waste collection process, it is necessary that route optimization should be performed in order to decrease the emissions. This study was performed in Trabzon City with 39 districts, a shortest path model was used in order to optimize solid waste collection/hauling processes to minimize emission. Unless it performs route optimization in solid waste collection/hauling process, emissions increase due to empty miles negativeness. A software was used as an optimization tool. The software provided Geographical Information System (GIS) elements such as numerical pathways, demographic distribution data, container distribution data and solid waste production data. In addition, thematic container layer was having 777 points for the entire city. By using the software, the optimized route was compared with the present route. If the optimized route in solid waste collection system is used, route distance and route time will be decreased by 24·6 % and 44·3 % as mean of nine routes, respectively. By performing the stationary container collection process and route optimization, it is determined that $CO_2, NOx, HC, CO, PM$ emissions will be reduced 831·4, 12·8, 1·2, 0·4, 0·7 $g$ per route, respectively</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mechanism design, an important tool in microeconomics, has found widespread applications in modelling and solving decentralized design problems in many branches of engineering, notably computer science, electronic commerce, and network economics. Mechanism design is concerned with settings where a social planner faces the problem of aggregating the announced preferences of multiple agents into a collective decision when the agents exhibit strategic behaviour. The objective of this paper is to provide a tutorial introduction to the foundations and key results in mechanism design theory. The paper is in two parts. Part 1 focuses on basic concepts and classical results which form the foundation of mechanism design theory. Part 2 presents key advanced concepts and deeper results in mechanism design</p>

				<title>Inﬂuence of roughness parameters on coefﬁcient of friction under lubricated conditions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0181-0190</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface texture and thus roughness parameters inﬂuence coefﬁcient of friction during sliding. In the present investigation, four kinds of surface textures with varying roughness were attained on the steel plate surfaces. The surface textures of the steel plates were characterized in terms of roughness parameter using optical proﬁlometer. Then the pins made of various materials, such as $Al-4Mg$ alloy, $Al-8Mg$ alloy, $Cu, Pb, Al, Mg, Zn$ and $Sn$ were slid against the prepared steel plates using an inclined pin-on-plate sliding tester under lubricated conditions. It was observed that the surface roughness parameter, namely, Ra, for different textured surfaces was comparable to one another although they were prepared by different machining techniques. It was also observed that for a given kind of surface texture the coefﬁcient of friction did not vary with $R_a$. However, the coefﬁcient of friction changes considerably with surface textures for similar $R_a$ values for all the materials investigated. Thus, attempts were made to study other surface roughness parameters of the steel plates and correlate them with coefﬁcient of friction. It was observed that among the surface roughness parameters, the mean slope of the proﬁle, Del $a(\Delta _a)$, was found to explain the variations best.</p>

				<title>Subsurface deformation and the role of surface texture—A study with Cu pins and steel plates</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0191-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The extent of subsurface deformation below the worn surface inﬂuences friction and transfer layer formation during sliding. Thus, in this study, the extent of plastic deformation and strain localization events that occur at various depths beneath the worn surface in the subsurface zones of Cu pins slid against steel plate with various surface textures have been determined using simple metallographic techniques. Results showed that the magnitude of plastic strain gradient and the depth of highly deformed zone depend on both coefﬁcient of friction and transfer layer formation, which in-turn depends on the surface texture of harder counterface, under both dry and lubricated conditions. In addition, it was seen that the gradient of equivalent strain, as it approached the worn surface, was higher under dry conditions when compared to that under lubricated conditions.</p>

				<title>Friction tensor concept for textured surfaces</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0203-0206</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Directionality of grinding marks inﬂuences the coefﬁcient of friction during sliding. Depending on the sliding direction the coefﬁcient of friction varies between maximum and minimum for textured surfaces. For random surfaces without any texture the friction coefﬁcient becomes independent of the sliding direction. This paper proposes the concept of a friction tensor analogous to the heat conduction tensor in anisotropic media. This implies that there exists two principal friction coefﬁcients $\mu_{1,2}$ analogous to the principal conductivities $k_{1,2}$. For symmetrically textured surfaces the principal directions are orthogonal with atleast one plane of symmetry. However, in the case of polished single crystalline solids in relative sliding motion, crystallographic texture controls the friction tensor.</p>

				<title>Effect of friction on the performance of inertial slider</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0221-0226</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inertial sliders are friction based drives used to position with a resolution of a few hundred of nanometers to over a range of few millimeters. The compactness and simple construction enabled it to be used as a coarse positioner in various Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPM). Even heavy masses has been thought off earlier to use the inertial slider to position precisely, lack of understanding in the dynamical friction behaviour has been the main reason why the inertial sliders potential has not been explored fully in any practical device. In this paper, we have studied the effect of different operating parameters on the step size of the slider.</p>
					<p>The inertial mass is kept on three sapphire balls, which are attached to shear piezoelectric material. The behaviour of inertial mass was studied for different input waveforms and different surface conditions that come in contact with the sapphire balls. It was observed that under lubricated conditions the step size was reduced.</p>

				<title>An effective sensor for tool wear monitoring in face milling: Acoustic emission</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0227-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Acoustic Emission (AE) has been widely used for monitoring manufacturing processes particularly those involving metal cutting. Monitoring the condition of the cutting tool in the machining process is very important since tool condition will affect the part size, quality and an unexpected tool failure may damage the tool, work-piece and sometimes the machine tool itself. AE can be effectively used for tool condition monitoring applications because the emissions from process changes like tool wear, chip formation i.e. plastic deformation, etc. can be directly related to the mechanics of the process. Also AE can very effectively respond to changes like tool fracture, tool chipping, etc. when compared to cutting force and since the frequency range is much higher than that of machine vibrations and environmental noises, a relatively uncontaminated signal can be obtained.</p>
					<p>AE signal analysis was applied for sensing tool wear in face milling operations. Cutting tests were carried out on a vertical milling machine. Tests were carried out for a given cutting condition, using single insert, two inserts (adjacent and opposite) and three inserts in the cutter. AE signal parameters like ring down count and rms voltage were measured and were correlated with ﬂank wear values (VB max). The results of this investigation indicate that AE can be effectively used for monitoring tool wear in face milling operations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this technical paper, the microstructure, hardness, tensile deformation and ﬁnal fracture behaviour of an emerging titanium alloy for performance-critical applications are presented and discussed. Both longitudinal and transverse test specimens were prepared from the as-provided sheet stock of the alloy and deformed in uniaxial tension. The yield strength and tensile strength of the alloy sheet in the transverse orientation was higher than the longitudinal orientation. The ductility of the test specimens, quantiﬁed in terms of reduction-in-cross-sectional area, was higher for the transverse specimen when compared to the longitudinal counterpart. The elongation-to-failure of the test specimens was identical in the two orientations of the sheet stock. The tensile fracture behaviour of the alloy was quantiﬁed by careful examination of the fracture surfaces in a scanning electron microscope. The intrinsic fracture features on the tensile fracture surface were discussed taking into consideration the nature of loading and contribution from intrinsic microstructural features.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper highlights the interfacial structure of tin-silver $(Sn-3·5Ag)$ solder on nickel-coated copper pads during aging performance studies at a temperature of $150^\circ C$ for up to $96 h$. Experimental results revealed the as-solidiﬁed solder bump made from using the lead-free solder $(Sn-3·5Ag)$ exhibited or showed a thin layer of the tin–nickel–copper intermetallic compound (IMC) at the solder/substrate interface. This includes a sub-layer having a planar structure immediately adjacent to the $Ni$-coating and a blocky structure on the inside of the solder. Aging performance studies revealed the thickness of both the IMC layer and the sub-layer, having a planar structure, to increase with an increase in aging time. The observed increase was essentially non-linear. Fine microscopic cracks were observed to occur at the interfaces of the planar sub-layer and the block sub-layer.</p>

				<title>The extrinsic inﬂuence of carbon ﬁbre reinforced plastic laminates to strengthen steel structures</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0261-0272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The intrinsic advantages of strengthening the steel-based structures by the use of ﬁbre reinforced plastic (FRP) material have not yet been fully exploited. In this paper, a succinct overview of recent studies made to enhance the strength of steel beams using FRP laminates is presented. The results presented and discussed in this paper were obtained by closely studying the behaviour of steel beams strengthened with carbon FRP material. An attempt is made to succinctly summarise the ﬁndings for two different types of strengthening of the steel beams using carbon FRP laminates. The ﬁrst type of beams focuses on enhancing the strength of steel in ﬂexure while the second focuses on increasing the shear strength of the beams. Three beams were designed so as to cause them to fail in ﬂexure. Of the beams studied, two were strengthened using carbon FRP strips attached to the tension ﬂange. One of the beams was tested to facilitate comparison of their behaviour to the two beams which are strengthened in ﬂexure. Three other beams were designed such that they failed predominantly in shear. Of these three, two were strengthened with carbon FRP strips attached to the webs while the third beam was used as a control beam for the purpose of drawing comparisons. Preliminary results revealed a noticeable increase in the strength for both the ﬂexure strengthened beams and the beams strengthened in shear. The observed increase in shear strength of the beams was 26% while the increase in strength for the beams tested in ﬂexure was 15%. This study convincingly shows that it is possible to strengthen steel beams using carbon FRP laminates in both ﬂexure and in shear.</p>

				<title>Near surface stress analysis strategies for axisymmetric fretting</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0273-0297</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fretting is essentially a surface phenomenon, but bulk stresses and material properties contribute to subsequent failure. This feature of fretting demands a thorough understanding of near surface stresses under the joint action of normal, shear and thermal loading. Axisymmetric fretting is of great concern in piping and coupling design. In this paper, we develop design tools for Near Surface Analysis (NSA) for understanding axisymmetric fretting. Axisymmetric Fretting Analysis (AFA) becomes formidable owing to localised tractions that call for Fourier transform techniques. We develop two different NSA strategies based on two-dimensional plane strain models: $2D$ strip model $(2DS)$ and half-plane Flamant model $(2DF)$. We compare the results of $2DS$ and $2DF$ with the exact results for AFA obtained using Love’s stress function in conjunction with Fourier transform. There is a good correspondence between stress components obtained from $2D$-models.</p>

				<title>Axisymmetric fretting analysis in coated cylinder</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0299-0327</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fretting is essentially a contact fatigue phenomenon, although bulk stresses and material properties contribute to ﬁnal failure. The near surface state of stress developed under oscillatory contact between machine elements plays a major role in deciding the severity of fretting. It is possible to enhance tribological properties by coating the surface. There is rather scanty literature available on fretting analysis of coated components. Presence of such coatings has a large inﬂuence on the near surface state of stress. The effect of coatings on the severity of fretting is the focus of this paper. Results obtained for both hard and soft coatings are compared with the results obtained for the homogeneous case. The component geometry and loading are chosen to be cylindrical to enable $3D$ elastic axisymmetric fretting analysis. The results are compared with $2D$ models (strip and half-plane) to examine their utility and validity for understanding axisymmetric fretting. Contact pressure and frictional shear loading cases are solved separately and superposed appropriately depending on the coefﬁcient of friction considered. Results for different values of coefﬁcient of friction and elastic mismatch are illustrated through contour plots of stresses and strains. These results are expected to be helpful for identifying fretting failure zones and fracture mechanisms in coated components. Analytical results presented here could serve as useful benchmarks for calibrating numerical codes and experimental techniques.</p>

				<title>Micro and macro contact mechanics for interacting asperities</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0329-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Contact of rough surfaces at micro and macro scales is studied in this paper. The asperities at micro scale are characterised by small radius of curvature whereas the waviness is characterised by large radius of curvature. When two rough surfaces come in contact, on the micro scale, of asperities contacts in a very small area leave large gaps between the surfaces; whereas on the macro scale the surfaces conform to each other under the application of load without gaps. Contact at micro scale is modelled by superposition of Hertzian stress ﬁelds of individual asperity contacts and the waviness at macro scale is modelled as a mixed boundary problem of rough punch indentation where displacements of uneven proﬁle are prescribed along the region of contact. In both the cases for simpliﬁcation the roughness is assigned to one surface making the other surface perfectly ﬂat an assumption often made in contact mechanics of rough bodies.</p>
					<p>The motivation for modelling the asperities at micro scales comes from the preliminary results obtained from photoelastic experiments. Numerical results are presented based on the analytical results available for Hertzian contacts. The motivation for modelling the asperities at macro scales comes from the results available in literature for ﬂat contacts from solving mixed boundary elasticity problems. A condition of full stick is assumed along the contact which is a common assumption made for rough contacts. The numerical results are presented for both the cases of rough contact at micro and macro scales.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fretting fatigue is the phenomenon of crack initiation due to dynamic contact loading, a situation which is commonly encountered in mechanical couplings subjected to vibration. The study of fretting fatigue in high frequency regime has gained importance in recent years. However the stress wave effects at high frequency y loading is scanty in the literature. The objective of present investigation is to study stress wave propagation in cylinders with reference to high frequency fretting. The case of a coated cylinder is considered since coating is often provided to improve tribological properties of the component. Rule of mixtures is proposed to understand the dispersion phenomenon in coated or layered cylinder knowing the dispersion relation for the cases of homogeneous cylinders made of coating and substrate materials separately. The possibility of stress wave propagation at the interface with a particular phase velocity without dispersion is also discussed. Results are given for two different thicknesses of coating.</p>

				<page>0367-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper describes an analysis of adhesion at the contact between non-Gaussian rough surfaces using the Weibull distribution with skewness as the key parameter to characterize asymmetry. The analysis uses an improved elastic–plastic model of contact deformation that is based on accurate Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of an elastic–plastic single asperity contact. Large range of interference values is considered starting from fully elastic through elastic–plastic to fully plastic regime of contacting asperities. The well-established elastic and plastic adhesion indices are used to consider the different conditions that arise as a result of varying load and material parameters. The loading and unloading behaviour for different combinations of the adhesion indices and skewness values are obtained as functions of mean separation between the surfaces. Transitional values of adhesion indices and skewness at which the inﬂuence of surface forces becomes insigniﬁcant are found to depend on material and surface parameters. Comparison with studies using previous elastic–plastic model that was based on some arbitrary assumptions shows signiﬁcant differences in loading behaviour.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0385-0401</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Structural elements supporting motors or engines are frequently seen in technological applications. The operation of a machine may introduce additional dynamic stresses on the beam. It is important, then, to know the natural frequencies of the coupled beam-mass system, in order to obtain a proper design of the structural elements. The literature regarding the free vibration analysis of Bernoulli–Euler single-span beams carrying a number of spring-mass system and Bernoulli–Euler multi-span beams carrying multiple spring-mass systems are plenty, but on  Timoshenko multi-span beams carrying multiple spring-mass systems is fewer. This paper aims at determining the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a Timoshenko multi-span beam. The model allows to analyse the inﬂuence of the shear effect and spring-mass systems on the dynamic behaviour of the beams by using Timoshenko Beam Theory (TBT). The effects of attached spring-mass systems on the free vibration characteristics of the 1–4 span beams are studied. The natural frequencies of Timoshenko multi-span beam calculated by using secant method for non-trivial solution are compared with the natural frequencies of multi-span beam calculated by using Bernoulli–Euler Beam Theory (EBT) in literature; the mode shapes are presented in graphs.</p>

				<title>Elasto-plastic strain analysis by a semi-analytical method</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0403-0432</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of this paper is to develop a simulation model of large deformation problems following a semi-analytical method, incorporating the complications of geometric and material non-linearity in the formulation. The solution algorithm is based on the method of energy principle in structural mechanics, as applicable for conservative systems. A one-dimensional solid circular bar problem has been solved in post-elastic range assuming linear elastic, linear strain hardening material behaviour. Type of loading includes uniform uniaxial loading and gravity loading due to body force, whereas the geometry of the bar is considered to be non-uniformly taper. Results are validated successfully with benchmark solution  and some new results have also been reported. The location of initiation of elasto-plastic front and its growth are found to be functions of geometry of the bar and loading conditions. Some indicative results have been presented for static and dynamic problems and the solution methodology developed for one-dimension has been extended to the elasto-plastic analysis of two-dimensional strain ﬁeld problems of a rotating disk.</p>

				<title>A more general model for the analysis of the rock slope stability</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0433-0441</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The slope stability analysis has many applications in the engineering projects such as the dams, the roads and open pits structures. The method of analysis is usually based on the equilibrium conditions of the potential plane and wedge failures. The zone of the potential failure is stable whenever the stability forces dominate instability characteristics of the slope. In most of the classic methods of slope stability analysis, the joint surfaces are assumed to be continuous along the potential failure zone. These can cause an underestimated solution to the analysis. In this research the joint trace length is considered to be discontinuous across thepotential surface of failure as it happens in nature. Therefore, there exists a rock bridge between the local joint traces. Because of the numerous problems related to the rock slope stability the above assumption is satisﬁed and the shear strength characteristics of intact rock have taken part in the analysis. The analysis presented here gives a better concept, view, and idea of understanding the physical nature of rock slopes and includes more parameters governing the stability of the potential failure zone.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A large aperture disc ampliﬁer has been designed, set-up and characterized for its performance on small signal gain, spatial variation of gain, and thermal recovery time. This ampliﬁer, consisting of three elliptical Nd: phosphate glass discs of size $214 \times 114 \times 20 mm$ mounted at Brewster angle and pumped by ten xenon ﬁlled ﬂash lamps of $600 mm$ arc length, provided a small signal gain of 6 at electrical pump energy of $36 kJ$ (in a pulse of $450\mu s$) using an in-house developed dual-polarity capacitor bank based power supply. It was coupled to a high power $Nd$: phosphate glass laser chain and a maximum output pulse energy exceeding $100 J$ in a $1·5 ns (FWHM)$ pulse has been measured. A dry nitrogen gas based cooling system was developed for cooling the glass discs with a thermal recovery time of $\sim 20$ minutes.</p>

				<title>A new family of soft transition converters: Design and dynamic model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0459-0479</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The soft switching converters evolved through the resonant load, resonant switch, resonant transition and active clamp converters to eliminate switching losses in power converters. This paper brieﬂy presents the operating principle of the new family of soft transition converters; the methodology of design of these converters is presented through an example. In the proposed family of converters, the switching transitions of both the main switch and auxiliary switch are lossless. When these converters are analysed in terms of the pole current and throw voltage, the deﬁning equations of all converters belonging to this family become identical. Such a description allows one to deﬁne simple circuit oriented model for these converters. These circuit models help in evaluating the steady state and dynamic model of these converters. The standard dynamic performance functions of the converters are readily obtainable from this model. This paper presents these dynamic models and veriﬁes the same through measurements on a prototype converter.</p>

				<title>Simpliﬁed loss analysis and comparison of full-bridge, full-range-ZVS $DC-DC$ converters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0481-0504</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The loss of zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of active switches has been a serious limitation of full-bridge (FBZVS) converters. Many techniques have been proposed in the past to extend the range of ZVS operation over the wider and also the full range of operation. However, in these techniques ZVS is achieved at the expense of additional conduction loss in active switches and losses in the auxiliary components. In this paper, the analysis for the additional losses in various full-range FBZVS $DC–DC$ converters and their comparative evaluation is reported. Closed form expressions are derived for average value of device currents and losses. The loss curves for various topologies are plotted and compared. The analytical results are found to be consistent with the experimental efﬁciency tests performed on $500 W, 100 kHz$ prototype. It is concluded that a recently proposed new topology has the least penalty of additional losses.</p>

				<title>Design and implementation of $FPGA$-based phase modulation control for series resonant inverters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0505-0522</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Owing to the tremendous advances in the digital technology, and improved reliability and performance of the digital control mechanisms, this paper focuses on design and implementation of digital controller using $FPGA$-based circuit design approach. The digital controller proposed is designed for series resonant inverter used in $DC–DC$ converter applications. Phase modulation technique is proposed for the realization of digital controller on $FPGA$. The Series Resonant Converter (SRC) is considered in this paper as a preferred converter topology for high power, high voltage power supplies. This paper studies the implementation of phase shift modulation technique using $FPGA$. The inverter designed, is $IGBT$ based, and Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) technique is implemented due to reduced stresses on devices and increased efﬁciency. The phase modulated series resonant inverters $(PM-SRC)$ promotes ZVS operation when its switching frequency is greater than resonant frequency. The designed $PM$ controller is realized using $FPGA$ on which control algorithm and other features of a controller are developed. The series resonant inverter is built and tested for full load under open loop and closed loop conditions at a switching frequency of $20 kHz$. The results are presented under varying load conditions. The simulation and the experimental results were found to match closely.</p>

				<title>Analysis and performance of novel and highly efﬁcient electronic ballast operating at unity-power-factor</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0523-0535</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the electronic ballast, in which the coupling inductors are used to inject the current to the dc-bus capacitors, to boost the dc-bus voltage and to ﬁlter out the ripples from input line current. The current injection coupling inductor injects its stored energy to the dc-bus capacitors in every switching half cycle. Whereas, the boost coupling inductor keeps the dc-bus voltage always above the peak of ac input voltage. Therefore, the proposed ballast maintains unity-power-factor and high efﬁciency with ripple-free input current over wide range of input line voltage in case of worst regulation. A symmetrical half-bridge inverter is used to drive the ﬂuorescent lamps. The experimental results of the laboratory prototype ballast for $2\times 36 W$ ﬂuorescent lamps operating at $50 kHz$ are presented.</p>

				<title>A novel converter topology for TEM applications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0537-0549</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-domain Electro Magnetic (TEM) systems, are used for remote sensing of conductive mineral deposits buried under the surface of the earth. A low frequency trapezoidal current excitation set-up in an exciter coil loop causes a ﬂux that penetrates deep into the earth. When the excitation is cut off sharply, conductive deposits in the earth carrying ﬂux react by causing eddy current ﬂows within them. The ﬂux produced by such eddy currents is picked up by a sensor coil. By comparing the emf induced in the sensor coil with a priori known emf patterns for mineral deposits, the presence of mineral deposits can be ascertained. The voltage, current and energy levels of the TEM system, require special type of excitation technique.</p>
					<p>Power converters for such non-standard requirements are not reported in the literature, particularly for TEM applications. This paper introduces TEM systems to the reader and presents the requirements for excitation. A converter topology to meet the requirements, it’s analysis, control and performance are presented. Among other alternatives that the authors have attempted, the topology presented features reduced number of passive elements, high voltage gain and low losses. These features enable the sensor head to be operated from the normal low level battery.</p>

				<page>0551-0564</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a three-level inverter-fed induction motor drive operating under Direct Torque Control (DTC) is presented. A triangular wave is used as dither signal of minute amplitude (for torque hysteresis band and ﬂux hysteresis band respectively) in the error block. This method minimizes ﬂux and torque ripple in a three-level inverter fed induction motor drive while the dynamic performance is not affected. The optimal value of dither frequency and magnitude is found out under free running condition. The proposed technique reduces torque ripple by 60% (peak to peak) compared to the case without dither injection, results in low acoustic noise and increases the switching frequency of the inverter. A laboratory prototype of the drive system has been developed and the simulation and experimental results are reported.</p>

				<title>Space and time harmonics related problems and their mitigation for position and speed sensorless slip-ring induction motor drives applications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0565-0580</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There have been renewed interests in slip-ring induction machines due to their increasing use in both grid connected and stand-alone wind power generation schemes. Despite the squirrel cage induction generators’ advantages of being brushless, low-cost, needing less maintenance and having inherent overload protection, the biggest advantage of variable-speed wound rotor induction machines is in its doubled energy capture. Also in high power induction motor drives such as static Kramer drives or static Scherbius drives use of wound rotor induction motors is a must. Thus it becomes necessary to measure the speed of the machine for closed loop control for such high performance drives. Recently, a sensorless position and speed estimation scheme was proposed for wound rotor wind power generator. In this paper, the limitation of the scheme caused by space and time harmonics have been investigated. Simulation results have been presented to explain the mechanism of the space and time harmonics caused distortion of current. Experimental results showing the deterioration of speed detection scheme at light load for a slip-ring induction motor have been presented. Finally, improvements have been applied experimentally to obtain better speed estimation.</p>

				<title>DSP-based electric power assisted steering using BLDC motor</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0581-0590</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper introduces a design and implementation of electrically assisted power steering (EAS) using BLDC motor for a vehicle. The control architecture consists of two layers of control, namely the vehicle speed associated control and the torque assist control. In the higher level of control architecture, the vehicle speed controller works as an assistance level controller for the steering effort. In the lower level, the torque controller gives the effort level control. This has been realized by torque sensor and vehicle sensor interfaced in the DSP. For implementing in the system, a DSP-based BLDC motor controller with three-phase inverter module is specially designed using Hall-effect sensor feedback and a single dc-link current sensor. This work is implemented in a Light Commercial Vehicle having a recirculating ball type gear. This is for the ﬁrst time (EAS) being implemented for this type of vehicle any where in the world. Generally, EAS having clutch to disconnect the motor in high speed or abnormal conditions from the gear box. In this implementation the motor is directly coupled to gearbox without clutch and all abnormalities are handled by the processor. This is implemented without modifying the vehicle supply system like changing the existing alternator or rating of the battery and using the existing sensors. The design is such a way that the feel of the driver assistance can be varied easily at any time. The performance of the control system is experimentally veriﬁed and it is tested in one of the Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV).</p>

				<title>Minimization and identiﬁcation of conducted emission bearing current in variable speed induction motor drives using PWM inverter</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0615-0628</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The recent increase in the use of speed control of ac induction motor for variable speed drive using pulse width modulation (PWM) inverter is due to the advent of modern power electronic devices and introduction of microprocessors. There are many advantages of using ac induction motor for speed control applicatons  in process and aerospace industries, but due to fast switching of the modern power electronic devices, the parasitic coupling produces undesirable effects. The undesirable effects include radiated and conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) which adversely affect nearby computers, electronic/electrical instruments and give rise to the ﬂow of bearing current in the induction motor. Due to the ﬂow of bearing current in the induction motor, electrical discharge machining takes place in the inner race of the bearing which reduces the life of the bearing. In high power converters and inverters, the conducted and radiated emissions become a major concern. In this paper, identiﬁcation of bearing current due to conducted emission, the measurement of bearing current in a modiﬁed induction motor and to minimize the bearing current are discussed. The standard current probe, the standard line impedance stabilization network (LISN)), the electronics interface circuits are used to measure high frequency common mode current, bearing current and to minimize the conducted noise from the system. The LISN will prevent the EMI noise entering the system from the supply source by conductive methods, at the same time prevents the EMI generated if any due to PWM, fast switching in the system, will not be allowed to enter the supply line. For comparing the results with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) standards, the graphs are plotted with frequency $Vs$, line voltage in $dB{_\mu} V$, common mode voltage in $dB{_\mu} V$ and the bearing current in $dB_{\mu} A$ with out and with minimizing circuits.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A Shunt Hybrid Active Filter (SHAF) is an attractive option for realizing low-cost harmonic compensation solutions. This paper proposes a SHAF with multiple harmonic compensation capability using a single Voltage Source Inverter and reduced sensor count. This strategy is apt for harmonic ﬁltering solutions where low cost is the exclusive priority. In this paper, a new estimation approach is proposed to obviate requirement of a large number of sensors. Multiple Synchronous Reference Frames (MSRF) and low pass ﬁlters are used to measure $5^{th}$ and $7^{th}$ harmonic components separately from load as well as ﬁlter currents. Individual current controllers are designed for the $5^{th}$ and $7^{th}$ harmonic currents. Control is realized in the synchronously rotating, orthogonal $(dq)$ reference frame. Performance of the controller is validated through simulation, using realistic plant and controller models. Experimental results are provided to corroborate the analytical and simulation results.</p>

				<title>Design and development of high voltage high power operational ampliﬁer using thick ﬁlm technology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0713-0720</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Applications of power operational ampliﬁers (opamps) are increasing day by day in the industry as they are used in audio ampliﬁers, Piezo transducer systems and the electron deﬂection systems. Power operational ampliﬁers have all the features of a general purpose opamp except the additional power handling capability. The power handling feature can be achieved using an external circuitry around a regular opamp. Normally power opamps can deliver current more than $50 mA$ and can operate on the supply voltage more than $\pm25 V$. This paper gives the details of one of the power opamps developed to drive the Piezo Actuators for Active Vibration Control (AVC) of aircraft/aerospace structures. The designed power opamp will work on $\pm200 V$ supply voltage and can deliver $200 mA$ current.</p>

				<title>Mixing of solids in different mixing devices</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0721-0731</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mixing of powders is a common operation in any industry. Most powders are known to be cohesive, many agglomerate spontaneously when exposed to humid atmosphere or elevated storage temperature. Agitation of the powder (especially powders with different bulk densities) may result in migration of smaller particles downwards and of larger ones upwards. Another problem is segregation whose main cause is the difference in particle size, density shape and resilience. There are standard mixing devices, such as drum tumblers or Turbula mixers. Alternate device type used is the static mixer of Kenics type. Static mixers save energy, disable segregation and effect particle migration. In this paper, static mixers, as devices for powder mixing, are tested as well as Turbula and V-shaped drum mixer, since those devices are commonly used for powder blending in industry. Mixtures that were blended by means of those three devices were made out of the model material, quartz sand, in different component ratios ($20:80$ and $30:70$). The results were statistically calculated and graphically presented. Cohesion indexes were measured with Powder Flow Analyser to see the effect of material ﬂow on the mixture quality. The results obtained by those three devices, the particle size effect and cohesion indexes, bring us to the conclusion that static mixers could be used for mixing of powders, but their shape, number of mixing elements and the mixer length should be adapted for each mixture separately, experimentally and mathematically, through modelling of the system.</p>

				<title>Effect of blow-holes on reliability of cast component</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0733-0751</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a study on the effect of blow-holes on the reliability of a cast component. The most probable point (MPP) based univariate response surface approximation is used for evaluating reliability. Crack geometry, blow-hole dimensions, external loads and material properties are treated as independent random variables. The methodology involves novel function decomposition at a most probable point that facilitates the MPP-based univariate response surface approximation of the original multivariate implicit limit state/performance function in the rotated Gaussian space. Once the approximate form of the original implicit limit state/performance function is deﬁned, the failure probability can be obtained by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), importance sampling technique, and ﬁrst- and second-order reliability methods (FORM/SORM). FORTRAN code is developed to automate calls to ABAQUS for numerically simulating responses at sample points, to construct univariate response surface approximation, and to subsequently evaluate the failure probability by MCS, importance sampling technique, and FORM/SORM.</p>

				<title>Determination of bounds on failure probability in the presence of hybrid uncertainties</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0753-0765</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A fundamental component of safety assessment is the appropriate representation and incorporation of uncertainty. A procedure for handling hybrid uncertainties in stochastic mechanics problems is presented. The procedure can be used for determining the bounds on failure probability for cases where failure probability is a monotonic function of the fuzzy variables. The procedure is illustrated through an example problem of safety assessment of a nuclear power plant piping component against stress corrosion cracking, considering the stochastic evolution of stress corrosion cracks with time. It is found that the bounds obtained enclose the values of failure probability obtained from probabilistic analyses.</p>

				<title>Development of digital image correlation method to analyse crack variations of masonry wall</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0767-0779</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The detection of crack development in a masonry wall forms an important study for investigating the earthquake resistance capability of the masonry structures. Traditionally, inspecting the structure and documenting the ﬁndings were done manually. The procedures are time-consuming, and the results are sometimes inaccurate. Therefore, the digital image correlation (DIC) technique is developed to identify the strain and crack variations. This technique is non-destructive for inspecting the whole displacement and strain ﬁeld. Tests on two masonry wall samples were performed to verify the performance of the digital image correlation method. The phenomena of micro cracks, strain concentration situation and nonuniform deformation distribution which could not have been observed preciously by manual inspection are successfully identiﬁed using DIC. The crack formation tendencies on masonry wall can be observed at an earlier stage by this proposed method. These results show a great application potential of the DIC technique for various situations such as inspecting shrinkage-induced cracks in fresh concrete, masonry and reinforced concrete structures, and safety of bridges.</p>

				<title>Free vibration of semi-rigid connected Reddy–Bickford piles embedded in elastic soil</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0781-0801</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The literature on free vibration analysis of Bernoulli–Euler and timoshenko piles embedded in elastic soil is plenty, but that of Reddy–Bickford piles partially embedded in elastic soil with/without axial force effect is fewer. The soil that the pile partially embedded in is idealized by Winkler model and is assumed to be two-layered. The pile part above the soil is called the ﬁrst region and the parts embedded in the soil are called the second and the third region, respectively. It is assumed that the behaviour of the material is linear-elastic, that axial force along the pile length to be constant and the upper end of the pile that is semi-rigid supported against rotation is modelled by an elastic spring. The governing differential equations of motion of the rectangular pile in free vibration are derived using Hamilton’s principle and Winkler hypothesis. The terms are found directly from the solutions of the differential equations that describe the deformations of the cross-section according to the high-order theory. The models have six degrees of freedom at the two ends, one transverse displacement and two rotations, and the end forces are a shear force and two end moments. Natural frequencies of the pile are calculated using transfer matrix and the secant method for non-trivial solution of linear homogeneous system of equations obtained due to values of axial forces acting on the pile, total and embedded lengths of the pile, the linear-elastic rotational restraining stiffness at the upper end of the pile and to the boundary conditions of the pile. Two different boundary conditions are considered in the study. For the ﬁrst boundary condition, the pile’s end at the ﬁrst region is semi-rigid connected and not restricted for horizontal displacement and the end at the third region is free and for the second boundary condition, the pile’s end at the ﬁrst region is semi-rigid connected and restricted for horizontal displacement and the end at the third region is ﬁxed supported. The calculated natural frequencies of semi-rigid connected Reddy–Bickford pile embedded in elastic soil are given in tables and compared with results of Timoshenko pile model.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0803-0820</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a new approach to deal with the dual-axis control design problem for a mechatronic platform. The cross-coupling effect leading to contour errors is effectively resolved by incorporating a neural net-based decoupling compensator. Conditions for robust stability are derived to ensure the closedloop system stability with the decoupling compensator. An evolutionary algorithm possessing the universal solution seeking capability is proposed for ﬁnding the optimal connecting weights of the neural compensator and PID control gains for the $X$ and $Y$ axis control loops. Numerical studies and a real-world experiment for a watch cambered surface polishing platform have veriﬁed performance and applicability of our proposed design.</p>

				<title>Progressive combustion in SI-Engines—Experimental investigation on inﬂuence of combustion related parameters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0821-0834</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fuel heat release rate which virtually controls the combustion process is dependent on the ‘Mass-Fraction-Burnt (MFB)’. In the present research work, a ‘logistic model with conditional variability in MFB’, has been developed for precise simulation of combustion in SI engines as the model has built in routines to take into account such factors as location of spark plug, single/dual spark plugs, intake generated swirl, combustion chamber geometry (associated with Bore/Stroke ratio), etc. A major contribution of this paper is that new and improved models for the ‘overall combustion duration’, and ‘ignition delay/ﬂame development angle’, taking into account primarily the inﬂuence of compression ratio on the overall combustion process in SI engine have been developed. Taylor’s original equation for estimating the overall combustion duration has been modiﬁed by including a logistic equation for the error term and incorporating it in the original equation. Ignition delay as proposed by Keck et al has been modiﬁed by incorporating a polynomial of 3rd order into the original equation. The empirical correlations that have been proposed in this paper may serve to be the starting point for simulation of ‘photodetonation concept’ to simulate HCCI combustion which is presently the hot research work in the area of pre-mixed combustion.</p>
					<p>A program in Turbo-C++ has been developed for the complete simulation of SI engine combustion, taking into account the conditional variability effect, variable speciﬁc heats of burnt gases, dissociation of gases at high temperatures, progressive combustion phenomena, heat transfer (based on Woschni‘s equation), gas exchange process based on $1D$-steady gas ﬂow equation employing Taylor’s mach index of 0·6 for valve design.</p>

					<p>In this paper I will discuss the fundamental ideas behind proof assistants: What are they and what is a proof anyway? I give a short history of the main ideas, emphasizing the way they ensure the correctness of the mathematics formalized. I will also brieﬂy discuss the places where proof assistants are used and how we envision their extended use in the future. While being an introduction into the world of proof assistants and the main issues behind them, this paper is also a position paper that pushes the further use of proof assistants. We believe that these systems will become the future of mathematics, where deﬁnitions, statements, computations and proofs are all available in a computerized form. An important application is and will be in computer supported modelling and veriﬁcation of systems. But there is still a long road ahead and I will indicate what we believe is needed for the further proliferation of proof assistants.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Remote procedure calls (RPCs) lie at the heart of any client/server software. Thus, formal speciﬁcation and veriﬁcation of RPC mechanisms is a prerequisite for the veriﬁcation of any such software. In this paper, we present a mathematical speciﬁcation of an RPC mechanism and we outline how to prove the correctness of an implementation — say written in C — of this mechanism at the code level. We deﬁne a formal model of user processes running concurrently under a simple operating system, which provides inter-process communication and portmapper system calls. A simple theory of non-interference permits us to use conventional sequential program analysis between system calls (within the concurrent model). An RPC mechanism is speciﬁed and the correctness proof for server implementations, using this mechanism, is outlined. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst treatment of the correctness of an entire RPC mechanism at the code level.</p>

				<page>0221-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The focus of this paper is to automatically segment and label continuous speech signal into syllable-like units for Indian languages. In this approach, the continuous speech signal is ﬁrst automatically segmented into syllable-like units using group delay based algorithm. Similar syllable segments are then grouped together using an unsupervised and incremental training (UIT) technique. Isolated style HMM models are generated for each of the clusters during training. During testing, the speech signal is segmented into syllable-like units which are then tested against the HMMs obtained during training. This results in a syllable recognition performance of 42·6% and 39·94% for Tamil and Telugu. A new feature extraction technique that uses features extracted from multiple frame sizes and frame rates during both training and testing is explored for the syllable recognition task. This results in a recognition performance of 48·7% and 45·36%, for Tamil and Telugu respectively. The performance of segmentation followed by labelling is superior to that of a ﬂat start syllable recogniser (27·8% and 28·8% for Tamil and Telugu respectively).</p>

				<page>0243-0254</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heat load studies have been performed for the ﬁrst crystal of a double crystal monochromator to be installed in a beamline of the $2·5 GeV$ synchrotron radiation source Indus-2. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been used to calculate the temperature distribution and the mechanical distortions on these crystals. Several cases of cooling schemes and heat loads have been studied. Based on these FEA results, the analytical relationships available in the literature have been modiﬁed. It is shown that modiﬁed analytical results compare well with the empirical results obtained from FEA. The optimisation of the cooling conditions can be achieved by doing FEA calculations for only one case. All other cases can then be calculated by using analytical relations proposed here. The proposed analytical equations are generic in nature and can be applied for any source—crystal combination and therefore would be useful for performance prediction of any new monochromator on a new synchrotron source without taking recourse to time consuming, computation-intensive FEA.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A two-dimensional numerical analysis of coupled heat and mass transfer processes in a cylindrical metal hydride reactor containing $MmNi_{4·6}Al_{0·4}$ is presented. To understand the hydrogen absorption mechanism the governing equations for energy, momentum and mass conservation and reaction kinetic equations are solved simultaneously using the ﬁnite volume method (FVM). Performance studies on $MmNi_{4·6}Al_{0·4}$ based hydrogen storage device are carried out by varying  the hydrogen supply pressure, absorption (cooling ﬂuid) temperature, overall heat transfer coefﬁcient and hydride bed thickness. Effect of convection terms in the energy equation on hydrogen storage performance is found to be negligible. The results obtained from the computer simulation showed good agreement with the available experimental data. At the supply conditions of 30 bar and $298 K$, $MmNi_{4·6}Al_{0·4}$ stores about $1·28 wt$%, which is very close to the experimental value of $1·3 wt$%. Overall high heat transfer coefﬁcients are found to reduce the absorption time signiﬁcantly.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0271-0298</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we discuss the results of a series of tests carried out to assess the level set methodology for capturing interfaces between two immiscible ﬂuids. The tests are designed to investigate the accuracy of convection process, the preservation of interface shape, and the mass conservation properties of individual ﬂuids. These test cases involve the advection of interfaces of different shapes exposed to translation, rotation, deformation, and shear ﬂow. Prescribed solenoidal velocity ﬁelds are used and no attempt is made to couple the advection of the level set function with the momentum equations. For the solution of level set equation we have employed ﬁrst-order upwind scheme, MacCormack method, second-order ENO scheme, and ﬁfth-order WENO scheme. Our studies show that the level set method perform well when higher-order schemes are used for the solution of advection equation. However, for certain type of shearing and vortical velocity ﬁelds mass conservation is an issue on coarser meshes even with higher order schemes. Finer mesh must be used in such situations to reduce numerical diffusion.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The super-heater and re-heater tubes of the boilers used in thermal power plants are subjected to unacceptable levels of surface degradation by the combined effect of erosion–corrosion mechanism, resulting in the tube wall thinning and premature failure. The nickel-based superalloys can be used as boiler tube materials to increase the service life of the boilers, especially for the new generation tra-supercritical boilers.</p>
					<p>The aim of the present investigation is to evaluate the erosion–corrosion behaviour of $Ni$-based superalloy Superni-75 in the real service environment of the coal-ﬁred boiler of a thermal power plant. The cyclic experimental study was performed for $1000 h$ in the platen superheater zone of the coal-ﬁred boiler where the temperature was around $900^\circ C$. The corrosion products have been characterized with respect to surface morphology, phase composition and element concentration using the combined techniques of X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX) and electron probe micro analyser (EPMA). The Superni-75 performed well in the coal-ﬁred boiler environment, which has been attributed mainly to the formation of a thick band of chromium in scale due to selective oxidation of the chromium.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The object of the present paper is to investigate plane $SH$ waves through a magneto-elastic crustal layer based over an elastic, solid semi space under the inﬂuence of surface stress on the free surface of the crustal layer and irregularity of the interface. Two types of irregularities of the interface namely, rectangular and parabolic have been considered. Modulations of wave velocity due to the presence of surface stress, irregularity and the magnetic ﬁeld have been studied separately. Their combined effect has also been investigated. Graphs are drawn to highlight some important peculiarities. It is observed that surface stress, irregularity and magnetic ﬁeld have their respective role to play in the propagation of SH waves in the crustal layer.

				<title>The effect of limestone powder, ﬂy ash and silica fume on the properties of self-compacting repair mortars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0331-0343</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Self-compacting repair mortars (SCRM) are preferred for the rehabilitation and repair of reinforced concrete structures especially at narrow mould systems. Self compactability and stability are susceptible to ternary effects of chemical and mineral admixture type and their content. In this study, the effect of limestone powder (LP) on the properties of SCRM has been compared with other mineral additives (silica fume (SF) and ﬂy ash (FA) and their combinations) effects. Fresh properties, ﬂexural and compressive strengths and water absorption properties of mortars were determined. The use of SF in mortars signiﬁcantly increased the dosage of superplasticiser (SP). At the same constant SP dosage (0·8%) and mineral additives content (30%), LP can better improve the workability than that of control and FA mixtures by 19% and 27%. However, the results of this study suggest that certain FA, SF and LP combinations can improve the workability of SCRMs, more than FA, SF and LP alone. LP can have a positive inﬂuence on the mechanical performance at early strength development while SF improved aggregate-matrix bond resulting from the formation of a less porous transition zone in mortar. SF can better reducing effect on total water absorption while FA and LP will not have the same effect, at 28 days.</p>

				<title>State-of-the-art review on fracture analysis of concrete structural components</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0345-0367</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a critical review of literature on fracture analysis of concrete structural components. Review includes various fracture models, tension softening models, methodologies for crack growth analysis and remaining life prediction. The widely used fracture models which are based on ﬁctitious crack approach and effective elastic crack approach have been explained. Various tension softening models such as linear, bi-linear, tri-linear, etc. have been presented with appropriate expressions. From the critical review of models, it has been observed that some of the models have complex expressions involving many parameters. There is a need to develop some more generalised models. Studies have been conducted on crack growth analysis and remaining life prediction using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) principles. From the studies, it has been observed that there is signiﬁcant difference between predicted and experimental observations. The difference in the values is attributed to not considering the tension softening effect in the analysis.</p>

				<title>Optical and thermal performance of a three-dimensional compound parabolic concentrator for spherical absorber</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0369-0380</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For medium range temperature applications, focusing type collectors like Compound Parabolic Concentrator (CPC) are most commonly used. Considerable research work has been carried out to improve the performance of the two-dimensional compound parabolic concentrator (2D CPC). The three-dimensional compound parabolic concentrator (3D CPC) was found to be more efﬁcient than 2D CPC because of the higher concentration ratio. In the present work a 3D CPC was fabricated with a half acceptance angle of $4^\circ$ for a spherical absorber of radius $100 mm$. UV stabilized aluminized polyester foil having high reﬂectivity (0·85) was pasted on the reﬂector for a total height of $441 mm$ and an aperture width of $540 mm$. The optical efﬁciency was estimated theoretically and compared with the experimental value. Experimentally determined values of optical and thermal efﬁciencies were in good agreement with theoretically predicted value. The experimental results shown that the optical efﬁciency obtained from the 3D CPC (0·626) was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the 2D CPC (0·570) of similar dimensions. Since the optical efﬁciency of the 3D CPC was increased, the thermal efﬁciency of the collector was also increased. In addition to that, time constant of the concentrator was also calculated. The time constant of the 3D CPC (431 s) was fairly high when compared with the 2D CPC (110 s). An attempt was made to generate low pressure steam using 3D CPC in the in situ steam generation mode. The efﬁciency of the steam generation was about 38%, which was one of the possible applications of 3D CPC module.</p>

					<p>Application of a simple approach for the soft-decision decoding of Maximum-Transition-Run (MTR) codes has been presented in this paper. A lowdemanded hardware realization have been proposed for soft-decision decoding in MTR basic AND, OR and XOR logic circuits. The suggested approach is explored over the two-track, two-head $E^2PR4$ partial response magnetic recording system. The overall two-track channel detection complexity reduction of 41·9% is offered in simulation scheme, encoded by Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code, serially concatenated with inner MTR.

				<page>0393-0406</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new robust method of non-blind image watermarking is proposed in this paper. The suggested method is performed by modiﬁcation on singular value decomposition (SVD) of images in Complex Wavelet Transform (CWT) domain while CWT provides higher capacity than the real wavelet domain. Modiﬁcation of the appropriate sub-bands leads to a watermarking scheme which favourably preserves the quality. The additional advantage of the proposed technique is its robustness against the most of common attacks. Analysis and experimental results show much improved performance of the proposed method in comparison with the pure SVD-based as well as hybrid methods (e.g. DWT-SVD as the recent best SVD-based scheme).</p>

				<title>Application of $3D$ wavelet transforms for crack detection in rotor systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0407-0419</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dynamics and diagnostics of a cracked rotor have been gaining importance in recent years. The early detection of faults like fatigue cracks in rotor shafts are very important to prevent catastrophic failure of the rotor system. Vibration monitoring during start up or shut-down is as important as during steady state operation to detect cracks especially for machines such as aircraft engines which start and stop quite frequently and run at high speeds. So, the transient data of the cracked rotor has been transformed using the wavelet transforms for crack detection. Most of the works quoted in the literature used $1D$ wavelets or $2D$ wavelets (Continuous Wavelet Transform-CWT) for crack detection. The crack detectors in the signals are both time as well as frequency dependent. So, the use of $2D$ wavelets is also not enough to detect the crack. In the present work a 3D wavelet (CWT) has been utilized which clearly indicates both the time and frequency features of the crack. The presence of sub-criticals in the CWT may be a best crack indicator but it is not always reliable. The addition of noise to the signal may sometimes lead to inaccurate results. So, there is a need to identify a parameter in addition to the sub-criticals. The phase angle between the two signals (cracked and un-cracked) or two transverse vibrations can be a better crack indicator because it is very less sensitive to noise disturbance. So, to extract the above phase angle a new transform has been applied called Cross Wavelet Transform (XWT). The XWT is exploited for the ﬁrst time to a rotor fault detection system in the present work. Some interesting results have been obtained using the same. The advantage of the XWT is that both, the phase angles between the transverse signals and also the amplitudes of sub-criticals are viewed in a single plot. Parametric analysis is also carried out by varying crack depth and crack position for diagnostic purposes. The inverse problem of crack identiﬁcation (i.e. determining the crack parameters through known vibration data) has also been carried out using Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN).</p>

				<title>A model for signal processing and predictive control of semi-active structural control system</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0421-0437</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The theory for structural control has been well developed and applied to perform excellent energy dissipation using dampers. Both active and semi-active control systems may be used to decide on the optimal switch point of the damper based on the current and past structural responses to the excitation of external forces. However, numerous noises may occur when the control signals are accessed and transported thus causing a delay of the damper. Therefore, a predictive control technique that integrates an improved method of detecting the control signal based on the direction of the structural motion, and a calculator for detecting the velocity using the least-square polynomial regression is proposed in this research. Comparisons of the analytical data and experimental results show that this predictor is effective in switching the moving direction of the semi-active damper. This conclusion is further veriﬁed using the component and shaking table test with constant amplitude but various frequencies, and the $El$ Centro earthquake test. All tests conﬁrm that this predictive control technique is effective to alleviate the time delay problem of semi-active dampers. This predictive control technique promotes about 30% to 40% reduction of the structural displacement response and about 35% to 45% reduction of the structural acceleration response.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Flow into a passage resembling a gas turbine blade cooling passage is considered and entropy generation rate in the passage is examined for unique rotation number and density ratios. In the simulations, leading and trailing walls of the passage are assumed to be at constant temperature. A control volume approach is introduced to discretize the governing equations of ﬂow, heat transfer, and entropy generation. Reynolds stress turbulence model is accommodated in the simulation to account for the turbulence. The study is extended to include two rotational speeds and three density ratios. The passage aspect ratio is kept $10:1$. It is found that volumetric entropy generation rate attains high values at passage inlet due to attainment of high temperature gradient in this region. Increasing rotation number and density ratio enhances volumetric entropy generation rate in the passage.</p>

In the present study, parallel plates, in between, ﬁlled with the ﬂuid are considered. The ﬂuid motion resulted from the bi-vertical compression of the top plate of the parallel plates is examined. The entropy generation rate in the ﬂow system is formulated after considering the constant movement of the top plate, constant applied load, and the combination of the constant velocity and applied load to the top plate. The optimum operating conditions related to the ﬂuid motion in between the parallel plates is determined through the entropy analysis. It is found that the combination of the constant velocity and the constant applied load resulted in the low entropy generation rate.</p>

				<title>Development and test of a new catalytic converter for natural gas fuelled engine</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0467-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents characteristics of a new catalytic converter (catco) to be used for natural gas fuelled engine. The catco were developed based on catalyst materials consisting of metal oxides such as titanium dioxide ($TiO_2$) and cobalt oxide ($CoO$) with wire mesh substrate. Both of the catalyst materials (such as $TiO_2$ and $CoO$) are inexpensive in comparison with conventional catalysts (noble metals) such as palladium or platinum. In addition, the noble metals such as platinum group metals are now identiﬁed as human health risk due to their rapid emissions in the environment from various resources like conventional catalytic converter, jewelers and other medical usages. It can be mentioned that the $TiO_2/CoO$ based catalytic converter and a new natural gas engine such as compressed natural gas (CNG) direct injection (DI) engine were developed under a research collaboration program. The original engine manufacture catalytic conveter (OEM catco) was tested for comparison purposes. The OEM catco was based on noble metal catalyst with honeycomb ceramic substrate. It is experimentally found that the conversion efﬁciencies of $TiO_2/CoO$ based catalytic converter are 93%, 89% and 82% for $NO_x, CO$ and $HC$ emissions respectively. It is calculated that the $TiO_2/CoO$ based catalytic converter reduces 24%, 41% and 40% higher $NO_x, CO$ and $HC$ emissions in comparison to OEM catco respectively. The objective of this paper is to develop a low-cost three way catalytic converter to be used with the newly developed CNG-DI engine. Detailed review on catalytic converter, low-cost catalytic converter development characteristics and CNGDI engine test results have been presented with discussions.</p>

				<title>Reverse stream ﬂow routing by using Muskingum models</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0483-0499</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reverse stream ﬂow routing is a procedure that determines the upstream hydrograph given the downstream hydrograph. This paper presents the development of methodology for Muskingum models parameter estimation for reverse stream ﬂow routing. The standard application of the Muskingum models involves calibration and prediction steps. The calibration step must be performed before the prediction step. The calibration step in a reverse stream ﬂow routing system uses the outﬂow hydrograph and the inﬂow at the end period of the inﬂow hydrograph as the known inputs and Muskingum model parameters are determined by minimizing the error between the remaining portion of the predicted and observed inﬂow hydrographs. In the present study, methodology for parameter estimation is developed which is based on the concept of minimizing the sum of squares of normalized difference between observed and computed inﬂows subject to the satisfaction of the routing equation. The parameter estimation problems are formulated as constrained nonlinear optimization problem, and a computational scheme is developed to solve the resulting nonlinear problem. The performance evaluation tests indicate that a fresh calibration is necessary to use the Muskingum models for reverse stream ﬂow routing.</p>

				<title>Revenue sharing in semiconductor industry supply chain: Cooperative game theoretic approach</title>

				<page>0501-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deﬁnes cooperation as the process of coordinating the objectives and activities of supply chain (SC) members. It also focuses on cooperation as a solution for hybrid coordination mechanism to form the basis for semiconductor industry supply chain management. In the complex and competitive environment of semiconductor industry supply chain, independent system members are facing the difﬁcult task of providing/sharing incentives resulting from e-market activities  in a fair and equitable manner. So, various other activities are necessary for the e-market to make revenue sharing operations more stable and reliable. In this context, the importance of coalition in enhancing the e-market capability, for revenue generation and sharing, is used to develop a possible mechanism for financial compensation to the supply chain members. Interpreting the supply chain as cooperation, the concepts of the Shapely value are used in this paper for analysing the revenue sharing problem. The motivation behind such a scheme is to align the supply chain members’ cost structure with the bidding value during auction and bargaining for e-procurement. The appropriateness of the Shapely value is verified to ensure that a stable solution exists. The practical implication of this paper is how to make right decisions about revenue sharing. The principal contribution of this approach is for establishing a pooling coalition in order to provide a stable and cooperative solution.</p>

				<title>$RF$ sputtering: A viable tool for MEMS fabrication</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0543-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fabrication of Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) requires deposition of ﬁlms such as $SiO_2, Si_3N_4, ZnO$, polysilicon, phosphosilicate glass (PSG), $Al, Cr-Au, Pt$, etc. for use as structural, sacriﬁcial, piezoelectric and conducting material. Deposition of these materials at low temperature is desirable for fabricating sensors/actuators on temperature-sensitive substrates and also for integrating MEMS structures on silicon in post-CMOS processing procedures. Plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and sputtering are amongst potential techniques for preparing ﬁlms for MEMS fabrication at comparatively low temperatures. The sputtering technique has an added advantage that the process is carried out in an inert ambient (argon) and chemically sensitive substrate/sacriﬁcial layers can be used in realization of MEMS. Furthermore, the same system can be used for depositing dielectric, piezoelectric and conducting materials as per requirement in the fabrication sequence. This enables rapid low-cost prototyping of MEMS with minimum fabrication facilities.</p>
					<p>In the present work, we report preparation, characterization and application of $RF$ sputtered $SiO_2, Si_3N_4$ and $ZnO$ ﬁlms for MEMS fabrication. The effect of $RF$ power, sputtering pressure and target-to-substrate spacing was investigated on the structural and other properties of the ﬁlms. The residual stress in the ﬁlms was obtained using wafer curvature measurement technique. The deposition parameters are optimized to obtain low stress ﬁlms of $SiO_2 and Si_3N_4$. The self-heating of the substrate during deposition was advantageously exploited to obtain highly $c$-axis oriented ﬁlms of $ZnO$ without any external heating. A variety of MEMS structures such as cantilever beams, micro-bridges, diaphragms, etc. are demonstrated using bulk, surface and surface-bulk micromachining techniques.</p>

				<title>A new approach to integrate $PLZT$ thin ﬁlms with micro-cantilevers</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0563-0572</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work, we report the preparation of $PLZT$ thin ﬁlms in pure perovskite phase by $RF$ magnetron sputtering without external substrate heating and their integration with micro-cantilevers. The ‘lift-off’ process for patterning different layers of a micro-cantilever including $PLZT, Pt/Ti$ and $Au/Cr$ was employed. The basic requirement of lift-off process is that the deposition temperature should not exceed $200^\circ C$ otherwise photoresist will burn out. Therefore, one of the aims of the present work was to prepare $PLZT$ ﬁlm at lower deposition temperatures, which can be subsequently annealed to form pure perovskite phase. This also strongly favours the incorporation of ‘lift-off’ process for patterning in the complete process ﬂow. As no external substrate heating was required in the deposition of $PLZT$ ﬁlm, this objective has been successfully accomplished in the present work. The ‘lift-off’ process has been successfully adopted for patterning the composite layers of $PLZT/Pt/Ti$ and $Au/Cr$ using thick positive photo-resist $(STR-1045)$. Different types of cantilever beams incorporating $PLZT$ ﬁlms have been successfully fabricated using ‘lift-off’ process and bulk micromachining technology. The proposed process can be advantageously applied for the fabrication of various MEMS devices.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The burst of the Internet bubble in 2000 has severely quenched the pace of development in the optical MEMS ﬁeld. However, it is now clear that this ﬁeld is again set to move forward as not only telecommunication but many other industries are beneﬁting from its application. We describe in this paper some of our latest achievements in the ﬁeld, showing a new type of small scale optical switch based on integrated optics, a vibration/acceleration sensor using a veryshort external cavity laser and ﬁnally, the early development result of a nano-scale tunable photonic crystal that could be used for beam steering. The diversity of the applications we demonstrate, is a clear testimony that there is indeed ‘plenty of room at the bottom’—and particularly in the natural combination of Light and MEMS!</p>

				<title>Fabrication of polymer-based reﬂowed microlenses on optical ﬁbre with control of focal length using differential coating technique</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0607-0613</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal reﬂow of polymer to generate spherical proﬁle has been used to fabricate microlenses in this paper. A simple model based on the volume conservation (before and after reﬂow) and geometrical consideration of lens proﬁle, shows that the focal length of the microlens produced by reﬂow technique is a function of the initial geometry of microcylinders, i.e. diameter and thickness. This relationship of focal length with diameter and thickness is used as a basis to control focal length. A simple spin coating technique on dual surface is used to achieve differential thickness, to control the focal length of microlenses produced on the same substrate. A biomedical application of such combination of microlenses is endoscopy where the lenses of varying diameter and equal focal length are needed on top of optical ﬁbre bundles to provide independent function of illumination and imaging. This paper incorporates the differential thickness technique to show a micro fabrication process to produce the polymer reﬂowed microlenses, with a control of focal length based on thickness. The design also helps to integrate these microlenses on top an optical ﬁbre with accurate alignment.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0615-0623</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a novel MOEMS (Micro Opto Electromechanical Systems) pressure sensor suitable for localized precision measurements in high temperature environments. The sensor is based on a micromachined Fabry–Perot device (MFPD) that uses a thin ﬁlm microcantilever beam as the top mirror and a silicon substrate as the bottom mirror of the optical microcavity. The major effect that the viscosity and density of the air surrounding the MFPD have on the viscous damping provides the mechanism for the detection of the pressure. A major advantage of this conﬁguration is that there is no need for a sealed microcavity since the air is trapped by the viscous damping effects. The sensor has been tested up to 90 psi and pressure sensitivities of about 0·04%/psi with a MFPD sensor with a resonant frequency of about $46·7 kHz$ have been measured.</p>

				<title>An $X$ band $RF$ MEMS switch based on silicon-on-glass architecture</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0625-0631</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Communication systems such as those used on satellite platforms demand high performance from individual components that make up the varoius  systems and sub-systems. Switching and routing of $RF$ signals between various modules is a routine and critical operation that determines the overall efﬁciency of the entire system. In this paper, we present the design and fabrication aspects of a direct contact $RF$ MEMS switch designed to operate in the $X$ band $(8–12 GHz)$ with a target insertion of about $0·5 dB$ and isolation better than $30 dB$. The actuation voltage is expected to be around $50 V$. The die size is designed to be $3 mm (H)\times 3 mm(W)\times 2 mm(H)$. The switch is built from a low residual stress device layer of a highly conducting $(0·005 Ohms-cm)$ silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer. After subsequent lithographic steps, the wafer is bonded to a Pyrex glass wafer which has been previously patterned with gold transmission lines and pull in electrodes. Being built from a single crystal silicon structure, the mechanical robustness of the actuator is much greater than the those in similar membrane-based devices. A 6 mask fabrication process utilizing Deep Reactive Ion Etching to achieve high aspect ratio stiction free structures was developed and implemented. Devices from the ﬁrst fabrication run are being analysed in our laboratory.</p>

				<title>Design and characterization of in-plane MEMS yaw rate sensor</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0633-0642</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we present the design and characterization of a vibratory yaw rate MEMS sensor that uses in-plane motion for both actuation and sensing. The design criterion for the rate sensor is based on a high sensitivity and low bandwidth. The required sensitivity of the yaw rate sensor is attained by using the inplane motion in which the dominant damping mechanism is the ﬂuid loss due to slide ﬁlm damping i.e. two–three orders of magnitude less than the squeeze-ﬁlm damping in other rate sensors with out-of-plane motion. The low bandwidth is achieved by matching the drive and the sense mode frequencies. Based on these factors, the yaw rate sensor is designed and ﬁnally realized using surface micromachining. The inplane motion of the sensor is experimentally characterized to determine the sense and the drive mode frequencies, and corresponding damping ratios. It is found that the experimental results match well with the numerical and the analytical models with less than 5% error in frequencies measurements. The measured quality factor of the sensor is approximately 467, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that for a similar rate sensor with out-of-plane sense direction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Porous Silicon (PS) is a versatile material with many unique features making it viable in the ﬁeld of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS). In this paper, we discuss the optimization of formation parameters of micro and macro $PS$ with different porosity and thickness for use in pressure sensors. The optimized material is used in the fabrication of composite $Si/PS$ membranes in piezo-resistive pressure sensors and tested. Pressure sensors with composite membranes have higher sensitivity than those with single crystalline silicon membrane with the sensitivity increasing as the porosity increases. For the same porosity and thickness of the $PS$ layer, $Si$/micro $PS$ membranes exhibit higher sensitivity than $Si$/macro $PS$ ones. The offset voltage in these sensors is found to be high and can be due to the stress induced in the membrane during $PS$ formation. Offset voltage and stress values are found to be higher in composite membranes with micro $PS$ as compared to macro $PS$.</p>

				<title>Effect of metal coating and residual stress on the resonant frequency of MEMS resonators</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0651-0661</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MEMS resonators are designed for a ﬁxed resonant frequency. Therefore, any shift in the resonant frequency of the ﬁnal fabricated structure can be a denting factor for its suitability towards a desired application. There are numerous factors which alter the designed resonant frequency of the fabricated resonator such as the metal layer deposited on top of the beam and the residual stresses present in the fabricated structure. While the metal coating, which acts as electrode, increases the stiffness and the effective mass of the composite structure, the residual stress increases or decreases the net stiffness if it is a tensile or compressive type respectively. In this paper, we investigate both these cases by taking two different structures, namely, the micro cantilever beam with gold layer deposited on its top surface and the MEMS gyroscope with residual stresses. First, we carry out experiments to characterize both these structures to ﬁnd their resonant frequencies. Later, we analytically model those effects and compare them with the experimentally obtained values. Finally, it is found that the analytical models give an error of less than 10% with respect to the experimental results in both the cases.</p>

				<title>System integration design in MEMS – A case study of micromachined load cell</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0663-0675</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the critical issues in large scale commercial exploitation of MEMS technology is its system integration. In MEMS, a system design approach requires integration of varied and disparate subsystems with one of a kind interface. The physical scales as well as the magnitude of signals of various subsystems vary widely. Known and proven integration techniques often lead to considerable loss in advantages the tiny MEMS sensors have to offer. Therefore, it becomes imperative to think of the entire system at the outset, at least in terms of the concept design. Such design entails various aspects of the system ranging from selection of material, transduction mechanism, structural conﬁguration, interface electronics, and packaging. One way of handling this problem is the system-in-package approach that uses optimized technology for each function using the concurrent hybrid engineering approach. The main strength of this design approach is the fast time to prototype development. In the present work, we pursue this approach for a MEMS load cell to complete the process of system integration for high capacity load sensing. The system includes; a micromachined sensing gauge, interface electronics and a packaging module representing a system-in-package ready for end characterization. The various subsystems are presented in a modular stacked form using hybrid technologies. The micromachined sensing subsystem works on principles of piezo-resistive sensing and is fabricated using CMOS compatible processes. The structural conﬁguration of the sensing layer is designed to reduce the offset, temperature drift, and residual stress effects of the piezo-resistive sensor. ANSYS simulations are carried out to study the effect of substrate coupling on sensor structure and its sensitivity. The load cell system has built-in electronics for signal conditioning, processing, and communication, taking into consideration the issues associated with resolution of minimum detectable signal. The packaged system represents a compact and low cost solution for high capacity load sensing in the category of compressive type load sensor.</p>

				<title>Improving word coverage using unsupervised morphological analyser</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0703-0715</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Powerful computers are needed for processing tasks related to human languages these days. Human languages, also called natural languages, are highly versatile systems of encoding information and can capture information of various domains. To enable a computer to process information in human languages, the language needs to be appropriately ‘described’ to the computer, i.e. the language needs to be ‘modelled’. In this work, we present an approach for acquisition of morphology of inﬂectional language like Hindi. It is an unsupervised learning approach, suitable for languages with a rich concatenative morphology. Broadly, our work is carried out in three steps: 1. Acquire the morphology of Hindi from a raw (un annotated) Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysore text corpus, 2. prepare clusters and prepare stem bag and sufﬁx bag, 3. use the morphological knowledge to decompose given word as stems and sufﬁxes according to their morphological behaviour and add new words. A prime motivation behind this work is to eventually develop an unsupervised morphological analyser which is language-independent (used for Hindi). Second motivation is to develop a morphological segmentation which is language-independent as it is shown that study of morphology would beneﬁt to a range of NLP tasks such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation and information retrieval.</p>
					<p>Though Hindi is an important and a national language in India, little computational work has been done so far in this direction. Our work is one of the ﬁrst efforts in this regard and can be considered pioneering. There are many such languages for which it is very important to have a suitable but inexpensive computational acquisition process. Languages receive very little attention of computational linguistic research both in terms of availability of funds and number of researchers. We however do not claim that our approach is a solution for all such languages. Different languages have characteristics that require individual research attention.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Most of the existing modelling techniques for the speaker recognition task make an implicit assumption of sufﬁcient data for speaker modelling and hence may lead to poor modelling under limited data condition. The present work gives an experimental evaluation of the modelling techniques like Crisp Vector Quantization (CVQ), Fuzzy Vector Quantization (FVQ), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classiﬁers. An experimental evaluation of the most widely used Gaussian Mixture Model–Universal Background Model (GMM–UBM) is also made. The experimental knowledge is then used to select a subset of classiﬁers for obtaining the combined classiﬁers. It is proposed that the combined LVQ and GMM–UBM classiﬁer provides relatively better performance compared to all the individual as well as combined classiﬁers.</p>

				<page>0729-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the combined temporal and spectral processing methods for speaker recognition task under noise, reverberation or multi-speaker environments. Automatic speaker recognition system gives good performance in controlled environments. Speech recorded in real environments by distant microphones is degraded by factors like background noise, reverberation and interfering speakers. This degradation strongly affects the performance of the speaker recognition system. Combined temporal and spectral processing (TSP) methods proposed in our earlier study are used for pre-processing to improve the speaker-speciﬁc features and hence the speaker recognition performance. Different types of degradation like background noise, reverberation and interfering speaker are considered for evaluation. The evaluation is carried out for the individual temporal processing, spectral processing and the combined TSP method. The experimental results show that the combined TSP methods give relatively higher recognition performance compared to either temporal or spectral processing alone.</p>

For recognition, at ﬁrst, distances of the outer contour points from the centroid of the individual characters are calculated and these contour distances are then arranged in a particular order to get size and rotation invariant feature. Next, based on the arranged contour distances, the features are derived from different class of characters. Finally, we use these derived features of the characters to statistically compare the features of the input character for recognition.

				<title>A coordination theoretic model for three level supply chains using contracts</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0767-0798</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Typically, supply chain members are dependent on each other to manage various resources and information. The conﬂicting objectives and lack of coordination between supply chain members may often cause uncertainties in supply and demand. The basic elements of coordination theory like interdependency, coherency and mutuality may help in effective ﬂow of information and material between the dependent supply chain members. Supply chain contract can be an effective coordination mechanism to motivate all the members to be a part of the entire supply chain. There are different types of supply chain contracts such as buy back and quantity ﬂexibility contracts. Supply chain performance may be substantially improved by properly designing the contracts to share risks and rewards. The objective of this paper is to explore the applicability of coordination elements through an analytical model in three-level (Manufacturer–distributor–retailer) serial supply chains using contracts. The model evaluates the impact of supply chain contracts on various performance measures. The impact of some contract may be on some speciﬁc performance measure only, which helps managers to choose the type of contract if there is an objective of improving certain performance measure before hand. In three-level supply chains, the contracts are designed at two distinct interfaces: Manufacturer–distributor and distributor–retailer. The model demonstrates the complexity in evaluating the decision variables of three level supply chains. The proposed model is a novel approach to apply coordination theory at various levels of supply chain. The model also presents how the coordination elements are related to each other in various coordination cases.</p>

				<title>Investigation of wall-slip effect on lead-free solder paste and isotropic conductive adhesives</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0799-0810</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Slippage due to wall depletion effect is well-known in rheological investigation. The aim of this study was to investigate the inﬂuence of the paste microstructure on slip formation for the paste materials (lead-free solder paste and isotropic conductive adhesives). The effect of different ﬂow geometries, gap heights and surface roughness on the paste viscosity was investigated. The utilisation of different measuring geometries has not clearly showed the presence of wall-slip in the paste samples. The existence of wall-slip was found to be pronounced when gap heights were varied using the parallel plate geometry. It was also found that altering the surface roughness of the parallel plate measuring geometry did not signiﬁcantly eliminate wall-slip as expected. But results indicate that the use of a relatively rough surface helps to increase paste adhesion to the plates and to a certain extent inducing structural breakdown in the paste. Most importantly, the study also demonstrated on how the wall-slip formation in the paste material could be utilised for understanding of the paste microstructure and its ﬂow behaviour.</p>

				<title>Fractional-order integral and derivative controller for temperature proﬁle tracking</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0833-0850</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper establishes a new strategy to tune a fractional order integral and derivative (ID) controller satisfying gain and phase margins based on Bode’s ideal transfer function as a reference model, for a temperature proﬁle tracking. A systematic analysis resulting in a non-linear equation relating user-deﬁned gain and phase margins to the fractional order controller is derived. The closed-loop system designed has a feature of robustness to gain variations with step responses exhibiting a nearly iso-damping property. This paper aims to apply the analytical tuning procedure to control the heat ﬂow systems at selected points in Quanser experimental platform. Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to examine performances of two different fractional order controllers in temperature proﬁle tracking. From experimental comparisons with the traditional $PI/PID$ controller based on Ziegler–Nichols’ tuning method, it will be shown that the proposed mathodologies are speciﬁcally beneﬁcial in controlling temperature in time-delay heat ﬂow systems.</p>

				<page>0851-0864</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Finite-time exergoeconomic performance of a Newtonian heat transfer law system generalized irreversible combined refrigeration cycle model with ﬁnite-rate heat transfer, heat leakage and internal irreversibility is presented in this paper. The operation of the generalized irreversible combined refrigeration cycle is viewed as a production process with exergy as its output. The performance optimization of the cycle is performed by taking proﬁt as the objective. The optimal proﬁt rate, optimal COP (coefﬁcient of performance), as well as the relation between the optimal proﬁt rate and COP of the cycle are derived. The focus of this paper is to obtain the compromise optimization between economics (proﬁt rate) and the energy utilization factor (COP) for the cycle, by searching the optimum COP at maximum proﬁt rate, which is termed as the ﬁnite time exergoeconomic performance bound. Moreover, the effects of various factors, including heat leakage, internal irreversibility and the price ratio, on the proﬁt rate performance of the cycle are analysed by detailed numerical examples.</p>

				<title>Modelling heterogeneity of concrete using $2D$ lattice network for concrete fracture and comparison with AE study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0865-0886</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, numerical modelling of fracture in concrete using two-dimensional lattice model is presented and also a few issues related to lattice modelling technique applicable to concrete fracture are reviewed. A comparison is made with acoustic emission (AE) events with the number of fractured elements. To implement the heterogeneity of the plain concrete, two methods namely, by generating grain structure of the concrete using Fuller’s distribution and the concrete material properties are randomly distributed following Gaussian distribution are used. In the ﬁrst method, the modelling of the concrete at meso level is carried out following the existing methods available in literature. The shape of the aggregates present in the concrete are assumed as perfect spheres and shape of the same in two-dimensional lattice network is circular. A three-point bend (TPB) specimen is tested in the experiment under crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) control at a rate of $0·0004 mm/sec$ and the fracture process in the same TPB specimen is modelled using regular triangular $2D$ lattice network. Load versus crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) plots thus obtained by using both the methods are compared with experimental results. It was observed that the number of fractured elements increases near the peak load and beyond the peak load. That is once the crack starts to propagate. AE hits also increase rapidly beyond the peak load. It is compulsory here to mention that although the lattice modelling of concrete fracture used in this present study is very similar to those already available in literature, the present work brings out certain ﬁner details which are not available explicitly in the earlier works.</p>

				<title>Reliability of redundant ductile structures with uncertain system failure criteria</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0903-0921</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Current reliability based approaches to structural design are typically element based: they commonly include uncertainties in the structural resistance, applied loads and geometric parameters, and in some cases in the idealized structural model. Nevertheless, the true measure of safety is the structural systems reliability which must consider multiple failure paths, load sharing and load redistribution after member failures, and is beyond the domain of element reliability analysis. Identiﬁcation of system failure is often subjective, and a crisp deﬁnition of system failure arises naturally only in a few idealized instances equally important. We analyse the multi-girder steel highway bridge as a $k$ out of $n$ active parallel system. System failure is deﬁned as gross inelastic deformation of the bridge deck; the subjectivity in the failure criterion is accounted for by generalizing $k$ as a random variable. Randomness in $k$ arises from a non-unique relation between number of failed girders and maximum deﬂection and from randomness in the deﬁnition of the failure deﬂection. We show how uncertain failure criteria and structural systems analyses can be decoupled. Randomness in the transverse location of trucks is considered and elastic perfectly plastic material response is assumed. The role of the system factor modifying the element-reliability based design equation to achieve a target system reliability is also demonstrated.</p>

				<title>Discharge estimation in compound channels with ﬁxed and mobile bed</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0923-0945</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two-dimensional (2-D) formulae for estimating discharge capacity of straight compound channels are reviewed and applied to overbank ﬂows in straight ﬁxed and mobile bed compound channels. The predictive capabilities of these formulae were evaluated using experimental data obtained from the small-scale University of Birmingham channel. Full details of these data and key references may be found at the following www.ﬂowdata.bham.ac.uk (university website). 2-D formulae generally account for bed shear, lateral shear, and secondary ﬂow effects via 3 coefﬁcients $f, \lambda $ and $\Gamma $. In this paper, the secondary ﬂow term($\Gamma $) used within the 2-D methods analysed here is ignored in all applications. Two different 2-D formulae almost give practically the same results for the same data when the secondary ﬂow term is ignored. For overall test cases, the value of dimensionless eddy viscosity $\lambda $ used in 2-D formulae was kept at $0·13 as$ recommended for open channels. 2-D formulae gave good predictions for most of the data sets studied in comparison with the traditional 1-D methods, namely the Single Channel Method (SCM) and the Divided Channel Method (DCM). The accuracy of predictions of 2-D formulae was increased by calibrating of $\lambda $ value where the calibration was needed. For overall data, the average errors for each method were Lateral Division Methods (LDMs), with $\lambda $ value of 0·13, 2·8%, DCM 14·3% and SCM $−26·8$%. The average error was 0·5% for LDMs with the calibrated values of $\lambda $.</p>

				<title>Effects of mass transfer on a resonance instability in the laminar boundary layer ﬂow over a rotating-disk</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0947-0965</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Direct spatial resonance phenomenon occurring in the viscous incompressible boundary layer ﬂow due to a rotating-disk is investigated in this paper based on the linear stability theory. The possible effects of suction and injection are explored on the direct spatial resonance instability mechanism detected earlier in the case of zero-suction. This instability leads to an algebraic growth of disturbances while the ﬂow is yet in the laminar regime and this in turn, may initiate the non-linearity and transition, competing with the unboundedly growing time-amplified perturbations. In line with the physical intuition, results show that suction delays the onset of resonance instability by increasing the critical Reynolds number, whereas it is enhanced by the presence of injection. The critical parameter for direct spatial resonance instability always precedes the onset value for absolute instability mechanism, after a comparison with the previous work. Therefore, in the case of suction, the onset parameter is close to the transition value as determined from the earlier experimental observations. It is further examined the inviscid nature of both absolute as well as direct spatial resonance instabilities when suction or injection is applied through the disk, and is demonstrated that these instability mechanisms are not in any way an artifact of the parallel ﬂow approximation assumed during the linearization of viscous incompressible stability equations.</p>

				<page>0967-0986</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Probabilistic sensitivities provide an important insight in reliability analysis and often crucial towards understanding the physical behaviour underlying failure and modifying the design to mitigate and manage risk. This article presents a new computational approach for calculating stochastic sensitivities of mechanical systems with respect to distribution parameters of random variables. The method involves high dimensional model representation and score functions associated with probability distribution of a random input. The proposed approach facilitates first-and second-order approximation of stochastic sensitivity measures and statistical simulation. The formulation is general such that any simulation method can be used for the computation such as Monte Carlo, importance sampling, Latin hypercube, etc. Both the probabilistic response and its sensitivities can be estimated from a single probabilistic analysis, without requiring gradients of performance function. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method provides accurate and computationally efﬁcient estimates of sensitivities of statistical moments or reliability of structural system.</p>

				<title>Effect of softening function on the cohesive crack fracture parameters of concrete CT specimen</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0987-1015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presents numerical study on the fracture parameters of concrete compact tension test specimens of different sizes using cohesive crack model. As softening function is the main ingredient of the cohesive crack model, seven numbers of widely used softening functions are incorporated in the model based on enhanced algorithm. It is found that the difference between the highest and the lowest peak loads obtained using various softening functions (except linear) is less than about 9%. The peak load predicted by the linear softening curve is about 16% larger than that of mean peak load predicted by other softening functions. The cohesive crack model with linear softening yields the fracture process zones lower by approximately 30–50% than those obtained by using the other softening relations for specimen size range $200–600 mm$. The numerical results are further compared with a reference test result available in the literature. It is observed that some of softening relations (except linear) predict the experimentally obtained peak load up to 6% of accuracy whereas the linear softening curve overestimates it by about 30%. The numerically gained softening branch of load-displacement curves compare well with the experimental observation.</p>

				<title>Acoustic reﬂection from the boundary of anisotropic thermoviscoelastic solid with ﬂuid</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1017-1032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Vertical slownesses of waves at a boundary of an anisotropic thermoviscoelastic medium are calculated as roots of a polynomial equation of degree eight. Out of the corresponding eight waves, the four, which travel towards the boundary are identiﬁed as upgoing waves. Remaining four waves travel away from the boundary and are termed as downgoing waves. Reﬂection and refraction of plane harmonic acoustic waves are studied at a plane boundary between anisotropic thermoviscoelastic solid and a non-viscous ﬂuid. At this ﬂuid-solid interface, an incident acoustic wave through the ﬂuid reﬂects back as an attenuated acoustic wave and refracts as four attenuating waves into the anisotropic base. Slowness vectors of all the waves in two media differ only in vertical components. Complex values of vertical slowness deﬁne inhomogeneous refracted waves with a ﬁxed direction of attenuation, i.e. perpendicular to the interface.</p>
					<p>Energy partition is calculated at the interface to ﬁnd energy shares of reﬂected and refracted waves. A part of incident energy dissipates due to interaction among the attenuated refracted waves. Numerical examples are considered to study the variations in energy shares with the direction of incident wave. For each incidence, the conservation of incident energy is veriﬁed in the presence of interaction energy. Energy partition at the interface seems to be changing very slightly with the azimuthal variations of the incident direction. Effects of anisotropy, elastic relaxation and thermal parameters on the variations in energy partition are discussed. The acoustic wave reﬂected from isothermal interface is much signiﬁcant for incidence around some critical directions, which are analogous to the critical angles in a non-dissipative medium. The changes in thermal relaxation times and uniform temperature of the thermoviscoelastic medium do not show any signiﬁcant effect on the reﬂected energy.</p>

				<title>Comparative analysis of steady state heat transfer in a TBC and functionally graded air cooled gas turbine blade</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Internal cooling passages and thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are presently used to control metal temperatures in gas turbine blades. Functionally graded materials (FGMs), which are typically mixtures of ceramic and metal, have been proposed for use in turbine blades because they possess smooth property gradients thereby rendering them more durable under thermal loads. In the present work, a functionally graded model of an air-cooled turbine blade with airfoil geometry conforming to the NACA0012 is developed which is then used in a ﬁnite element algorithm to obtain a non-linear steady state solution to the heat equation for the blade under convection and radiation boundary conditions. The effects of external gas temperature, coolant temperature, surface emissivity changes and different average ceramic/metal content of the blade on the temperature distributions are examined. Simulations are also carried out to compare cooling effectiveness of functionally graded blades with that of blades having TBC. The results highlight the effect of including radiation in the simulation and also indicate that external gas temperature inﬂuences the blade heat transfer more strongly. It is also seen that graded blades with about 70% ceramic content can deliver better cooling effectiveness than conventional blades with TBC.</p>

				<page>0031-0043</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gasketed bolted ﬂange pipe joints are always prone to leakage during operating conditions. Therefore, performance of a gasketed ﬂange joint is very much dependent on the proper joint assembly with proper gasket, proper gasket seating stress and proper pre-loading in the bolts of a joint. For a gasketed ﬂange joint, the two main concerns are the joint strength and the sealing capability. To investigate these, a detailed three-dimensional nonlinear ﬁnite element analysis of a gasketed joint is carried out using gasket as a solid plate. Bolt scatter, bolt bending and bolt relaxation are concluded as the main factors affecting the joint’s performance. In addition, the importance of proper bolt tightening sequence, number of passes inﬂuence of elastic and elasto-plastic material modelling on joint performance are also presented. A dynamic mode in a gasketed joint is concluded, which is the main reason for its failure.</p>

As a ﬁrst step, the conventional parallel, angular and combined parallel and angular misalignments are modelled using Lagrange multipliers. The static equilibrium position of the journal within the bearing is determined using an iterative nonlinear static ﬁnite element analysis. The present work proposes a method for computing the displacement-dependent stiffness terms from the experimental static loaddisplacement data. Finally, the orbit of the rotor around the static equilibrium is determined using a time-integration scheme.</p>

					<p>Polyphase Barker Sequences are ﬁnite length, uniform complex sequences; the magnitude of their aperiodic autocorrelation sidelobes are bounded by 1. Such sequences have been used in numerous real-world applications such as channel estimation, radar and spread spectrum communication. In this paper, thirty-two phase Barker sequences up to length 24 with an alphabet size of only 32 are presented. The sequences from length 25 to 289 have autocorrelation properties better than well-known Frank codes. Because of the complex structure the sequences are very difﬁcult to detect and analyse by an enemy’s electronic support measures (ESMs). The synthesized sequences are promising for practical application to radar and spread spectrum communication systems. These sequences are found using the Modiﬁed Simulated Annealing Algorithm (MSAA). The convergence rate of the algorithm is good.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, trajectory tracking fuzzy logic controller (TTFLC) is proposed for the speed control of a pneumatic motor (PM). A third order trajectory is deﬁned to determine the trajectory function that has to be tracked by the PM speed. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to ﬁnd the TTFLC boundary values of membership functions (MF) and weights of control rules. In addition, artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) modelled dynamic behaviour of PM is given. This ANN model is used to ﬁnd the optimal TTFLC parameters by ofﬂine GA approach. The experimental results show that designed TTFLC successfully enables the PM speed track the given trajectory under various working conditions. The proposed approach is superior to PID controller. It also provides simple and easy design procedure for the PM speed control problem.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)-based polymer electrolytes ﬁlms consisting of lithium triﬂuromethanesulfonate $(LiCF_3SO_3)$-ethylene carbonate (EC) were prepared by the solution-casting method. Ionic conductivities of the electrolytes have been determined by an impedance studies in the temperature range of $298–373 K$. Complexation of the prepared electrolytes is studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to conﬁrm the thermal stability of the polymer electrolytes. The conductivity–temperature plots were found to follow an Arrhenius nature. All these ﬁlms are found to be thermally stable until $132–167^\circ C$.</p>

				<title>Overview of pool hydraulic design of Indian prototype fast breeder reactor</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal hydraulics plays an important role in the design of liquid metal cooled fast breeder reactor components, where thermal loads are dominant. Detailed thermal hydraulic investigations of reactor components considering multi-physics heat transfer are essential for choosing optimum designs among the various possibilities. Pool hydraulics is multi-dimensional in nature and simple one-dimensional treatment for the same is often inadequate. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays a critical role in the design of pool type reactors and becomes an increasingly popular tool, thanks to the advancements in computing technology. In this paper, thermal hydraulic characteristics of a fast breeder reactor, design limits and challenging thermal hydraulic investigations carried out towards successful design of Indian Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) that is under construction, are highlighted. Special attention is paid to phenomena like thermal stratiﬁcation, thermal stripping, gas entrainment, inter-wrapper ﬂow in decay heat removal and multiphysics cellular convection. The issues in these phenomena and the design solutions to address them satisfactorily are elaborated. Experiments performed for special phenomena, which are not amenable for CFD treatment and experiments carried out for validation of the computer codes have also been described.</p>

				<title>A generalized relationship for swirl decay in laminar pipe ﬂow</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0129-0137</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Swirling ﬂow is of great importance in heat and mass transfer enhancements and in ﬂow measurements. In this study, laminar swirling ﬂow in a straight pipe was considered. Steady three-dimensional axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations were solved numerically using a control volume approach. The swirl number distribution along the pipe length was computed. It was found that the swirl number at any location along the pipe length depends on the swirl number at inlet, the ﬂow Reynolds number, the distance from the pipe inlet, the pipe diameter and the nature of the inlet swirl. A generalized relationship for swirl decay as a function of these parameters was then obtained by curve-ﬁtting technique.</p>

				<title>A hybrid evolutionary algorithm for distribution feeder reconﬁguration</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0139-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Distribution feeder reconﬁguration (DFR) is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem which minimizes real power losses, deviation of the node voltages and the number of switching operations and also balances the loads on the feeders. In the proposed method, the distance ($\lambda_2$ norm) between the vectorvalued objective function and the worst-case vector-valued objective function in the feasible set is maximized. In the algorithm, the status of tie and sectionalizing switches are considered as the control variables. The proposed DFR problem is a non-differentiable optimization problem. Therefore, a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on combination of fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FAPSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO), called HFAPSO, is proposed to solve it. The performance of HFAPSO is evaluated and compared with other methods such as genetic algorithm (GA), ACO, the original PSO, Hybrid PSO and ACO (HPSO) considering different distribution test systems.</p>

				<title>Evanescent magnetic ﬁeld effects on entropy generation at the onset of natural convection</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0163-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper numerically investigates the effect of an externally evanescent magnetic ﬁeld on total entropy generation in a ﬂuid enclosed in a square cavity by using a control volume ﬁnite element method to solve the conservation equations at Prandtl number of 0·71. The values of relaxation time of the magnetic ﬁeld are chosen, so that the Lorentz force acts only in the transient state of entropy generation in natural convection. The total entropy generation was calculated for, ﬁxed value of irreversibility distribution ratio, different relaxation time varying from 0 to 1/5 and Grashof number varying from $10^4$ to $10^5$. The effects of the Hartman number and the magnetic ﬁeld inclination angle on the evolution of total entropy generation throughout the transient regime were investigated. Results show that the application of evanescent magnetic ﬁeld not only suppresses the ﬂuctuation of the total entropy generation in the transient state, but also reduces the gap for magnetic ﬁeld relaxation time less than 1/10.</p>

				<title>Effects of nanoscale size dependent parameters on lattice thermal conductivity in Si nanowire</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0177-0193</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of nanoscale size dependent parameters on lattice thermal conductivity are calculated using the Debye–Callaway model including transverse and longitudinal modes explicitly for $Si$ nanowire with diameters of 115, 56, 37 and $22 nm$. A direct method is used to calculate the group velocity for different size nanowire from their related calculated melting point. For all diameters considered, the effects of surface roughness, defects and transverse and longitudinal Gruneisen parameters are successfully used to correlate the calculated values of lattice thermal conductivity to that of the reported experimental curve. The obtained ﬁtting value for mean Gruneisen parameter has a systematic dependence on all $Si$ nanowire diameters changing from 0·791 for $115 nm$ diameter to 1·515 for the $22 nm$ nanowire diameter. The dependence also gave a suggested surface thickness of about $5–6 nm$. The other two parameters were found to have partially systematic dependence for diameters 115, 56, and $37 nm$ for defects and 56, 37 and $22 nm$ for the roughness. When the diameters go down from 115 to $22 nm$, the concentration of dislocation increased from $1·16 \times 10^{19}cm^{−3}$ to $5·20 \times 10^{19}cm^{−3}$ while the surface roughness $P$ found to increase from 0·475 to 0·130 and the rms height deviation from the surface changes by about 1·66 in this range of diameter. The diameter dependence also indicates a strong control of surface effect in surface to bulk ratio for the $22 nm$ wire diameter.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0195-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work presents numerical analyses of transient temperature and thermally-induced stress distributions in a hollow steel sphere heated by a moving uniform heat source applied on a certain zenithal segment (the heated zenithal segment, $\Theta_H$) of its outer surface (the processed surface) under stagnant ambient conditions. Along the process, the moving heat source (MHS) moves angularly from the ﬁrst zenithal segment to the last zenithal segment on the processed surface with a constant angular speed,$\omega $, and then returns backward to the ﬁrst zenithal segment with the same speed. It is assumed that the inner surface is heat-isolated and that the outer surface except the heated segment is under stagnant ambient conditions. The numerical calculations are performed individually for a wide range of thermal conductivity, $\lambda $, of steel and for the different $\Theta_Hs$. The maximum effective thermal stress ratio calculated as per the heat ﬂux intensity $(q0)$ can be reduced in considerable amounts. By increasing $\lambda(\sim 75%)$ and $\omega(\sim 63%)$ the maximum effective thermal stress ratio calculated can be signiﬁcantly reduced.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A parametric time-frequency representation is presented based on timevarying autoregressive model (TVAR), followed by applications to non-stationary vibration signal processing. The identiﬁcation of time-varying model coefﬁcients and the determination of model order, are addressed by means of neural networks and genetic algorithms, respectively. Firstly, a simulated signal which mimic the rotor vibration during run-up stages was processed for a comparative study on TVAR and other non-parametric time-frequency representations such as Short Time Fourier Transform, Continuous Wavelet Transform, Empirical Mode Decomposition, Wigner–Ville Distribution and Choi–Williams Distribution, in terms of their resolutions, accuracy, cross term suppression as well as noise resistance. Secondly, TVAR was applied to analyse non-stationary vibration signals collected from a rotor test rig during run-up stages, with an aim to extract fault symptoms under non-stationary operating conditions. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that TVAR is an effective solution to non-stationary signal analysis and has strong capability in signal time-frequency feature extraction.</p>

The homogeneous, isotropic, elastic plate is inﬁnite in the $x$-direction and the sides are simply supported. The size of the force is changed in proportion to the displacement measured at a certain point of the plate. The proportionality constant serves as the control parameter. The mathematical formulation of this distributed control problem and its analytical solution in terms of the vibration frequencies of the plate are given.

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0241-0253</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study presents an approximate method based on the continuum approach and transfer matrix method for lateral stability analysis of buildings. In this method, the whole structure is idealized as an equivalent sandwich beam which includes all deformations. The effect of shear deformations of walls has been taken into consideration and incorporated in the formulation of the governing equations. Initially the stability differential equation of this equivalent sandwich beam is presented, and then shape functions for each storey is obtained by the solution of the differential equations. By using boundary conditions and stability storey transfer matrices obtained by shape functions, system buckling load can be calculated. To verify the presented method, four numerical examples have been solved. The results of the samples demonstrate the agreement between the presented method and the other methods given in the literature.</p>

					<p>In this paper, a coupled ﬁnite and inﬁnite element system is used to study the effects of canyon-shaped topography and geotechnical characteristics of the soil on the dynamic response of free surface and of 2-$D$ soil–structure systems under ground motion. A parametric study is carried out for canyon-shaped topographies. It is concluded that topographic conditions may have important effects on the ground motion along the canyon. Geotechnical properties of the soil also have signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation effects on the whole system motion, which cannot be neglected for design purposes. Thus, the dynamic response of both free surface and a soil–structure system are primarily affected by surface shapes and geotechnical properties of the soil. Location of the structure is another parameter affecting the whole system response.</p>

					<p>This paper presents an elasto-plastic element free Galerkin formulation based on Newton–Raphson algorithm for damage growth analysis. Isotropic ductile damage evolution law is used. A study has been carried out in this paper using the proposed element free Galerkin method to understand the effect of initial damage and its growth on structural response of single and bi-material problems. A simple method is adopted for enforcing EBCs by scaling the function approximation using a scaling matrix, when non-singular weight functions are used over the entire domain of the problem deﬁnition. Numerical examples comprising of one-and two-dimensional problems are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in analysis of uniform and non-uniform damage evolution problems. Effect of material discontinuity on damage growth analysis is also presented.</p>

The difﬁculty in computing the failure probability increases rapidly with the number of variables. In this paper, a few methods are proposed whereby the number of variables can be reduced without compromising the accuracy of the reliability calculation. Based on the sensitivity of the failure surface, three new reduction methods, namely (a) gradient iteration method, (b) dominant gradient method, and (c) relative importance variable method, have been proposed.

					<p>Stochastic seismic analysis of long-span bridges with Carbon ﬁbre reinforced polymer (CFRP) cables are presented in this study through combination of the advantages of the perturbation based stochastic ﬁnite element method (SFEM) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. Jindo cable-stayed and Fatih Sultan Mehmet (Second Bosporus) suspension bridges are chosen as an example. Carbon ﬁbre reinforced polymer cable (CFRP) and steel cables are used separately, in which the cable’s cross sectional area is determined by the principle equivalent axial stiffness. Geometric nonlinear effects are considered in the analysis. Uncertainties in the material are taken into account and Kocaeli earthquake in 1999 is chosen as a ground motion. The efﬁciency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm are validated by comparing with results of MCS method. It can be stated that using of CFRP cables in long-span bridges subjected to earthquake forces is feasible.</p>

					<p>Resonant ground motion has been observed in earthquake records measured at several parts of the world. This class of ground motion is characterized by its energy being contained in a narrow frequency band. This paper develops measures to quantify the frequency content of the ground motion using the entropy principle and the dispersion index. These measures are based on the geometric properties of the power spectral density function of the ground acceleration. The application of these measures to quantify the frequency content of random earthquake models is demonstrated ﬁrst. Subsequently, these measures are used to quantify the frequency content of the ground acceleration for near-ﬁeld records measured at rock and soil sites, short-duration and long-duration earthquakes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of this paper is to estimate permanent displacements of Tehri dam due to an earthquake of magnitude $M_w = 8·5$, the occurrence of which has a high probability in the region, and for an earthquake of magnitude $M_w = 7·0$, for which the dam has been currently designed. A two-dimensional ﬁnite element analysis and ﬁve different semi-empirical and empirical methods, like, Seed and Makdisi’s method, Newmark’s double integration method, Jansen’s method, Swaisgood’s method and Bureau’s method have been utilized to study the probable dynamic behaviour of the dam and their results are compared to get a range of values within which, the permanent displacement of the dam, is estimated to lie. The present study shows that the predicted displacements due to an earthquake of magnitude $M_w = 7·0$ are signiﬁcant but not enough to compromise the safety of the dam. However, the displacements predicted for an earthquake of magnitude $M_w = 8·5$ are quite high and might cause rupture of ﬁlter zones. The maximum deformations ($755 cm$ for $M_w = 8·5$ and $43 cm$ for $M_w = 7·0$) are predicted by Seed and Makdisi’s method while the minimum deformations ($14 cm$ for $M_w = 8·5$ and $2·5 cm$ for $M_w = 7·0$) are computed by Jansen’s method.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0393-0406</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sulphur Hexaﬂuoride $(SF_6)$ is generally found to be very sensitive to ﬁeld perturbations such as those caused by conductor surface imperfections and by conducting particle contaminants. A study of CIGRE group suggests that 20% of failures in Gas Insulated Substations (GIS) is due to the existence of various metallic contaminations in the form of loose particles. The presence of contamination can therefore be a problem with gas-insulated substations operating at high ﬁelds. If the effects of these particles could be eliminated, then this would improve the reliability of compressed gas insulated substation. It would also offer the possibility of operating at higher ﬁelds to affect a potential reduction in the GIS size with subsequent savings in the cost of manufacture and installation. The purpose of this paper is to develop techniques, which will formulate the basic equations that will govern the movement of metallic particles like aluminum, silver and copper in a bus duct. Simulation is carried out on particle movement with balanced and unbalanced voltages and the results have been presented and analysed.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we propose a novel and efﬁcient algorithm for modelling sub-$65 nm$ clock interconnect-networks in the presence of process variation. We develop a method for delay analysis of interconnects considering the impact of Gaussian metal process variations. The resistance and capacitance of a distributed RC line are expressed as correlated Gaussian random variables which are then used to compute the standard deviation of delay Probability Distribution Function (PDF) at all nodes in the interconnect network. Main objective is to ﬁnd delay PDF at a cheaper cost. Convergence of this approach is in probability distribution but not in mean of delay. We validate our approach against SPICE based Monte Carlo simulations while the current method entails signiﬁcantly lower computational cost.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper proposes a novel algorithm for recognition of handwritten digits. For this, the present paper classiﬁed the digits into two groups: one group consists of blobs with/without stems and the other digits with stems only. The blobs are identiﬁed based on a new concept called morphological region ﬁlling methods. This eliminates the problem of ﬁnding the size of blobs and their structuring elements. The digits with blobs and stems are identiﬁed by a new concept called ‘connected component’. This method completely eliminates the complex process of recognition of horizontal or vertical lines and the property called ‘concavities’. The digits with only stems are recognized, by extending stems into blobs by using connected component approach of morphology. The present method has been applied and tested with various handwritten digits from modiﬁed NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) handwritten digit database (MNIST), and the success rate has been given. The present method is also compared with various existing methods.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0433-0448</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nonlinear functions are crucial points and terms in engineering problems and the solutions of many important physical problems are centered on ﬁnding accurate solutions to these functions. In this paper, a new method called max–min method has been presented for deriving accurate/approximate analytical solution to strong nonlinear oscillators. Furthermore, it is shown that a large class of linear or nonlinear differential equations can be solved without the tangible restriction of sensitivity to the degree of the nonlinear term, adding that the method is quite convenient due to reduction in size of calculations. Results obtained by max–min are compared with Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM), energy balance and numerical solution and it is shown that, simply one term is enough to obtain a highly accurate result in contrast to HAM with just one term in series solution. Finally, the phase plane to show the stability of systems is plotted and discussed.</p>

				<feature></feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we propose a new $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ synchronization strategy, called a Radial Basis Function Neural Network $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ synchronization (RBFNNHS) strategy, for unknown chaotic systems in the presence of external disturbance. In the proposed framework, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is constructed as an alternative to approximate the unknown nonlinear function of the chaotic system. Based on this neural network and linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation, the RBFNNHS controller and the learning laws are presented to reduce the effect of disturbance to an $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm constraint. It is shown that ﬁnding the RBFNNHS controller and the learning laws can be transformed into the LMI problem and solved using the convex optimization method. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed RBFNNHS scheme.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The corrosion behaviour of $Fe–0·45P$ with/without addition of chromium, prepared by powder forging route was studied in different environments. The corrosion studies in acidic ($0·25 M H_2SO_4$ solution of $pH 0·6$) and neutral/marine ($3·5$% $NaCl$ solution of $pH 6·8$) solutions were conducted using Tafel Extrapolation method. The rate of corrosion in alkaline medium ($0·5 M Na_2CO_3 +1·0 M NaHCO_3$ solution of $pH 9·4$) was measured using linear polarization technique. The studies compare electrolytic Armco iron with $Fe–P$ alloys. It was observed that, chromium improved the resistance to corrosion in acidic and marine environments. The corrosion rates were minimal in alkaline medium and low in neutral solution.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper records the results of mechanical tests on iron–phosphorus powder alloys which were made using a hot powder forging technique. In this process mild steel encapsulated powders were hot forged into slabs. Then the slabs were hot rolled and annealed to relieve the residual stresses. These alloys were characterized in terms of microstructure, porosity content/densiﬁcation, hardness and tensile properties. Densiﬁcation as high as 98·9% of theoretical density; has been realized. Microstructures of these alloys consist of single-phase ferrite only. Alloys containing $0·45 wt$% $P$; such as $Fe–0·45P–2Cu–2Ni–1Si–0·5Mo$ and $Fe–0·45P–2Cu–2Ni–1Si–0·5Mo–0·15C$ show very high strength. Alloys developed in the present investigation were capable of being hot enough to be worked to very thin sheets and ﬁne wires.</p>

				<title>Dynamics of plasma expansion in the pulsed laser material interaction</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0493-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A pulse Nd: YAG laser with pulse duration $5–10 ns$, beam radius at focal point $0·2–0·4 mm$, wavelengths $1064 nm, 532 nm$ and $238 nm$ with linearly polarized radiation and Gaussian beam proﬁle, was impacted on a thin foil of titanium metal for generating plasma plume. Numerically, the above parameters were linked with average kinetic energy of the electrons and ions in the laser-induced plasma. In the present model, electrons having higher velocities are assumed to escape from plasma, that forms a negatively charged sheath around the plasma. It is seen from present computations that the forward directed nature of the laser evaporation process results from the anisotropic expansion velocities associated with different species. These velocities are mainly controlled by the initial dimension of the expanding plasma. An attempt was undertaken to estimate the length of the plume at different ambient gas pressures using an adiabatic expansion model. The rate of the plasma expansion for various $Ar^+$ ion energies was derived from numerical calculations. A numerical deﬁnition of this plasma includes events like collisional/radiative, excitation/de-excitation and ionization/recombination processes involving multiples of energy levels with several ionization stages. Finally, based on a kinetic model, the plasma expansion rate across the laser beam axis was investigated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Recommender system a new marketing strategy plays an important role particularly in an electronic commerce environment. Among the various recommender systems, collaborative recommender system (CRS) is widely used in a number of different applications such as recommending web pages, movies, tapes and items. CRS suffers from scalability, sparsity, and cold start problems. An intelligent integrated recommendation approach using radial basis function network (RBFN) and collaborative ﬁltering (CF), based on Cover’s theorem, is proposed in order to overcome the traditional problems of CRS. The proposed system predicts the trend by considering both likes and dislikes of the active user. The empirical evaluation results reveal that the proposed approach is more effective than other existing approaches in terms of accuracy and relevance measure of recommendations.</p>

				<title>Limited data speaker identiﬁcation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0525-0546</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the task of identifying the speaker using limited training and testing data is addressed. Speaker identiﬁcation system is viewed as four stages namely, analysis, feature extraction, modelling and testing. The speaker identiﬁcation performance depends on the techniques employed in these stages. As demonstrated by different experiments, in case of limited training and testing data condition, owing to less data, existing techniques in each stage will not provide good performance. This work demonstrates the following: multiple frame size and rate (MFSR) analysis provides improvement in the analysis stage, combination of mel frequency cepstral coefﬁcients (MFCC), its temporal derivatives $(\Delta,\Delta \Delta)$, linear prediction residual (LPR) and linear prediction residual phase (LPRP) features provides improvement in the feature extraction stage and combination of learning vector quantization (LVQ) and gaussian mixture model – universal background model (GMM–UBM) provides improvement in the modelling stage. The performance is further improved by integrating the proposed techniques at the respective stages and combining the evidences from them at the testing stage. To achieve this, we propose strength voting (SV), weighted borda count (WBC) and supporting systems (SS) as combining methods at the abstract, rank and measurement levels, respectively. Finally, the proposed hierarchical combination (HC) method integrating these three methods provides signiﬁcant improvement in the performance. Based on these explorations, this work proposes a scheme for speaker identiﬁcation under limited training and testing data.</p>

				<page>0547-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here the development of a facility to generate high (multi megagauss) magnetic ﬁeld of 4 to $5\mu s$ rise time, using inertial magnets. The facility includes a low inductance, high current capacitor bank $(280 kJ/40 kV)$ and an inertial magnet, which is a copper disk machined to have a keyhole in it. As the high current from the capacitor bank is discharged through the copper disk, a high magnetic ﬁeld is produced along its axis, before it is destroyed by the combined effect of the dynamic loading and skin effect. A maximum peak magnetic ﬁeld of $257 T$ is realized, when the magnet with $3·6 mm$ inner diameter, $35 mm$ outer diameter and $5 mm$ length, is powered by the capacitor bank charged to $28 kV (134 kJ)$. The transient magnetic ﬁeld is measured using a $B$ dot probe with an error of $\pm25 T$. The probe in most of high ﬁeld shots $(&gt; 200 T)$ got destroyed before recording the peak ﬁeld and the trailing edge of the magnetic ﬁeld. Experimental evidence of enhancement of the probe survival for longer time in copper disks using spatial non-uniform conductivity with $1 mm$ thick SS brazed to the inner wall of the inertial magnet is also reported.</p>

				<title>Application of digital-image-correlation techniques in analysing cracked cylindrical pipes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0557-0567</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cracks induced by external excitation on a material that has defects may generate the stress concentration phenomenon. The stress concentration behaviour causes local buckling, which will induce the damage of the members made of this material. Thus, developing techniques to monitor the strain variation of a cracked member is an important study. The traditional technique (such as strain gauge) can only measure the average strain of a region. The strain variation within this region cannot be determined. Therefore, it cannot sufﬁciently reﬂect the mechanical behaviour surrounding the crack. The Digital image correlation technique recently developed is an image identiﬁcation technique to be applied for measuring the object deformation. This technique is capable of correlating the digital images of an object before and after deformation and further determining the displacement and strain ﬁeld of an object based on the corresponding position on the image. In this work, this technique is applied to analyse the mechanics of a cylindrical pipe experiencing crack destruction. The ﬁxing device is used to avoid shaking the specimen during the pressurizing process. The image capture instruments are ﬁxed on the stable frame to measure the deformation of specimen accurately. Through the cylindrical pipe cracking test, the capacity of the digital image correlation technique for surveying the strain variation in a tiny region is validated. Then, the experimental results obtained using the digital image correlation analysis is used to demonstrate the crack development tendency in defect materials and the stress concentration zone.</p>

				<page>0569-0584</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most wind tunnel models are fabricated of all metal components using computerized numerical control (CNC) milling machines. Fabrication of metal wind tunnel models is very expensive and time consuming. The models can require months to manufacture and are often made by small high technology companies that specialize in wind tunnel model manufacture. Using rapid prototype manufacturing techniques and materials in this way signiﬁcantly reduces time and cost of production of wind tunnel models. This study was done by fused deposition modelling and their ability to make components for wind tunnel models in a timely and cost effective manner. This paper discusses the application of wind tunnel model conﬁguration constructed using FDM and FDM with chromium coating for subsonic wind tunnel testing. A study was undertaken comparing a rapid prototyping model constructed of FDM technologies using polycarbonate to that of a standard machined steel model. Results from this study show relatively good agreement among the three models and rapid prototyping method with chromium coating does have an effect on the aerodynamic characteristics which produced satisfactory results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A commercially available sintered friction pad is coupled with a standard gray cast iron pressure plate ($FG 250$ grade) and tested in a clutch dynamometer for understanding the engagement characteristics and thereby predicting the useful life in number of engagements. Results show that sintered friction pad has a very stable range of friction coefﬁcient (0·43–0·61) even after 5000 engagement cycles. The torque transmitted ranges from 350 to $400 N$ during one engagement cycle. The energy dissipation and mass loss of friction materials linearly increases with increasing sliding distance. A correlation is derived based on energy dissipation and mass loss in terms of total number of useful or available engagements before replacement or repair of friction pad or clutch pressure plate. Both the pressure plate and clutch disc with the sintered friction pad was tested in a 49 tons load capacity vehicle on a test track. Both sintered friction pad and pressure plate showed scoring marks along the sliding direction. Friction pad showed dense cracks along the top edge. Microscopic features of worn sintered friction pads show silica particle providing the required wear resistance for the pads. Pressure plate showed transfer layer of oxides and carbon with less scoring marks due to short duration vehicle level trials.</p>

					<p>Heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) plays a key role on performance of combined cycle (CC). In this work, attention was focused on a dual pressure reheat (DPRH) HRSG to maximize the heat recovery and hence performance of CC. Deaerator, an essential open feed water heater in steam bottoming cycle was located to enhance the efﬁciency and remove the dissolved gasses in feedwater. Each of the heating section in HRSG is solved from the local ﬂue gas condition with an aim of getting minimum possible temperature difference. For high performance, better conditions for compressor, HRSG sections, steam reheater and deaerator are developed. The CC system is optimized at a gas turbine inlet temperature of $1400^\circ C$ due to the present available technology of modern gas turbine blade cooling systems. The exergetic losses in CC system are compared with each other. The present DPRH HRSG model has been compared and validated with the plant and published data.</p>

				<page>0609-0618</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study of keyhole (KH) instability in deep penetration laser beam welding (LBW) is essential to understand welding process and appearance of weld seam defects. The main cause of keyhole collapse is the instability in KH dynamics during the LBW process. This is mainly due to the surface tension forces associated with the KH collapse and the stabilizing action of vapour pressure. A deep penetration high power $CW CO_2$ laser was used to generate KH in mild steel (MS) in two different welding conditions i.e. ambient atmospheric welding (AAW) and under water welding (UWW). KH, formed in case of under water welding, was deeper and narrower than keyhole formed in ambient and atmospheric condition. The number and dimensions of irregular humps increased in case of ambient and under water condition due to larger and rapid keyhole collapse also studied. The thermocapillary convection is considered to explain KH instability, which in turn gives rise to irregular humps.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present study highlights a multi-objective optimization problem by applying utility concept coupled with Taguchi method through a case study in CNC end milling of UNS $C34000$ medium leaded brass. The study aimed at evaluating the best process environment which could simultaneously satisfy multiple requirements of surface quality. In view of the fact, the traditional Taguchi method cannot solve a multi-objective optimization problem; to overcome this limitation, utility theory has been coupled with Taguchi method. Depending on Taguchi’s Lower-the-Better (LB) response criteria; individual surface quality characteristics has been transformed into corresponding utility values. Individual utility values have been aggregated ﬁnally to compute overall utility degree which serves as representative objective function for optimizing using Taguchi method. Utility theory has been adopted to convert a multi-response optimization problem into a single response optimization problem; in which overall utility degree serves as the representative single objective function for optimization. The study of combined utility theory and Taguchi method for predicting optimal setting. Based on Taguchi’s Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N), analysis has been made on the overall utility degree and optimal process environment has been selected ﬁnally which corresponds to highest S/N Ratio. Optimal result has been veriﬁed through conﬁrmatory test. The case study indicates application feasibility of the aforesaid methodology proposed for multiresponse optimization and off-line control of multiple surface quality characteristics in CNC end milling.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A relief valve parallel to the throttle valve is added to a Velocity dependent hydraulic damper (VDHD) so that the oriﬁce size that regulates the oil ﬂow can be adjusted. This device adjustment will allow the damper to have an adaptive control of damping by changing its damping coefﬁcient. A mathematical model including a serial friction model and a small damper that is parallel to the friction model added to the Maxwell model for simulating the actual energy-dissipating behaviour of the VDHD was proposed in this research. To extend the useful value of VDHD, a numerical analysis model based on the $SAP2000$ nonlinear analysis program was applied to simulate the energy-dissipating characteristics of VDHD in this study. The analysis results obtained by using the mathematical model and the proposed $SAP2000$ numerical model conform to the seismic resistant test results, and conﬁrm that the $SAP2000$ nonlinear analysis program can accurately describe the actual energy-dissipating behaviour of the VDHD installed on structures under various energy-dissipating situations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple method using a combination of conformal mapping and vortex panel method to simulate potential ﬂow in cascades is presented. The cascade is ﬁrst transformed to a single body using a conformal mapping, and the potential ﬂow over this body is solved using a simple higher order vortex panel method. The advantage of this method over existing methodologies is that it enables the use of higher order panel methods, as are used to solve ﬂow past an isolated airfoil, to solve the cascade problem without the need for any numerical integrations or iterations. The ﬂuid loading on the blades, such as the normal force and pitching moment, may be easily calculated from the resultant velocity ﬁeld. The coefﬁcient of pressure on cascade blades calculated with this methodology shows good agreement with previous numerical and experimental results.</p>

In this work, we propose an example of a new class of problems where, the ﬂuid is quiescent and the effect of an external periodic force on the motion of the particle is determined at low non-zero Reynolds numbers. We present an analysis of the dynamics of dilute suspensions of periodically forced prolate spheroids in a quiescent Newtonian ﬂuid at low Reynolds numbers including the effects of both convective and unsteady inertia. The inclusion of both forms of inertia leads to a nonlinear integro – differential equation which is solved numerically for the velocity and displacement of the individual particle. We show that a ‘normal stress’ like parameter can be evaluated using standard techniques of Batchelor. Hence this system allows for an experimentally accessible measurable macroscopic parameter, analogous to the ‘normal stress’, which can be related to the dynamics of individual particles. We note that this ‘normal stress’ arises from the internal ﬂuctuations induced by the periodic force. In addition, a preliminary analysis leading to a possible application of separating particles by shape is presented. We feel that our results show possibilities of being technologically important since the ‘normal stress’ depends strongly on the controllable parameters and our results may lead to insights in the development of active dampeners and smart ﬂuids. Since we see complex behaviour even in this simple system, it is expected that the macroscopic behaviour of such suspensions may be much more complex in more complex ﬂows.</p>

				<title>Effects of bed-load movement on ﬂow resistance over bed forms</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0681-0691</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of bed-load transport on ﬂow resistance of alluvial channels with undulated bed was experimentally investigated. The experiments were carried out in a tilting ﬂume $250 mm$ wide and $12·5 m$ long with glass-sides of rectangular cross-section and artiﬁcial dune shaped ﬂoor that was made from Plexi-glass. Steady ﬂow of clear as against sediment-laden water with different ﬂow depths and velocities were studied in the experiments with a ﬁne sand $(d_{50} = 0·5 mm)$. The results indicate that the transport of ﬁne particles $(d_{50} = 0·5 mm)$ can decrease the friction factor by 22% and 24% respectively for smooth and rough beds. Increasing the bed-load size $(d_{50} = 2·84 mm)$ can decrease the friction factor by 32% and 39% respectively for smooth and rough beds. The decrease in ﬂow resistance is due to ﬁlling up of the troughs of dunes. This separation zone is responsible for increasing the ﬂow resistance. On the upstream side of dunes condition is similar to plane bed. Presence of bed-load causes to increase the shear velocity and hence increasing ﬂow resistance. But decreasing in ﬂow resistance is more and it causes to decrease the total ﬂow resistance. Grains saturated the troughs in the bed topography, effectively helping in smoothening of bed irregularities.</p>

				<title>Sediment transport in an active erodible channel bend of Brahmaputra river</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0693-0706</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spatial variation of sediment transport in an alluvial sand-bed river bend needs to be understood with its inﬂuencing factors such as bank erosion, secondary current formation, land spur and bed-material characteristics. In this study, detailed hydrographic surveys with Acoustic Doppler Current Proﬁler (ADCP) were conducted at an active erodible river bend to measure suspended load, velocity, bathymetric proﬁle and characteristics of the bed material. Study indicates the presence of multi-thread ﬂow in the channel bend. Local variation of sediment transport is primarily controlled by active bank erosion, land spur and sand bar formation. Vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration follows a power function with normalized depth. Average bed-material concentration at the reach level is computed from observed sediment proﬁles, and is compared against various sediment transport functions. Results show that the sediment transport function suggested by Yang gives better predictions for this reach. Transverse bed slopes at critical survey transects were computed from the bathymetric data and evaluated with analytical approaches. Out of three analytical approaches used, Odgaard’s approach estimates the bed slopes fairly close to the observed one. These two functions are suitable in the Brahmaputra river for further morphological studies.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0707-0720</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, missing value analysis and homogeneity tests were conducted for 267 precipitation stations throughout Turkey. For this purpose, the monthly and annual total precipitation records at stations operated by Turkish State Meteorological Service (DMI) from 1968 to 1998 were considered. In these stations, precipitation records for each month was investigated separately and the stations with missing values for too many years were eliminated. The missing values of the stations were completed by Expectation Maximization (EM) method by using the precipitation records of the nearest gauging station. In this analysis, 38 stations were eliminated because they had missing values for more than 5 years, 161 stations had no missing values and missing precipitation values were completed in the remaining 68 stations. By this analysis, annual total precipitation data were obtained by using the monthly values. These data should be hydrologically and statistically reliable for later hydrological, meteorological, climate change modelling and forecasting studies. For this reason, Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT), (Swed–Eisenhart) Runs Test and Pettitt homogeneity tests were applied for the annual total precipitation data at 229 gauging stations from 1968 to 1998. The results of each of the testing methods were evaluated separately at a signiﬁcance level of 95% and the inhomogeneous years were determined. With the application of the aforementioned methods, inhomogeneity was detected at 50 stations of which the natural structure was deteriorated and 179 stations were found to be homogeneous.</p>

				<title>Effect of bimodularity on frequency response of cylindrical panels using Galerkin time domain approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0721-0738</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The forced vibration analysis of bimodulus material laminated structures is a challenging problem due to non-smooth nonlinear nature of governing equations. The most commonly used direct time integration schemes show numerical instability and do not predict steady state response except for limited number of cases without considering in-plane inertia. This is due to the sudden change of restoring force from positive/negative half cycle to negative/positive half cycle exciting higher modes/harmonics at every instant of a cycle change leading to numerical instability in the time marching scheme. In the present work, Galerkin time domain approach is successfully used for the forced vibration analysis of bimodular cylindrical panels. The effect of bimodularity ratio on the frequency response of cylindrical panels for few typical geometrical and lamination parameters is studied for the ﬁrst time. It is found that the positive half cycle amplitude is greater than the negative half cycle amplitude for $E_{2t}/E_{2c} &lt; 1$ and is smaller for $E_{2t}/E_{2c} &gt; 1$. Further, the percentage difference of positive and negative half cycle amplitudes decreases with the increase in $E_{2t}/E_{2c}$. The stresses under dynamic loading are different for positive and negative half of a vibration cycle.</p>

				<page>0739-0746</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The range of motion of the moving platform of a spatial 3-RPS parallel manipulator will be greatly inﬂuenced by the physical constraints such as limits on the lengths of the limbs and the range of motion of the spherical joints. Therefore, while synthesizing the parallel manipulator, the physical constraints have to be considered. Synthesis of the manipulator involves determination of the architectural parameters of the manipulator so that a point on the moving platform passes through a prescribed set of positions in space. This paper presents a synthesis procedure that determines location and direction of revolute joints and location of spherical joints along with orientation of sockets of spherical joints, considering the physical constraints. The synthesis procedure is demonstrated through a numerical example.</p>

The materials used in these industries are classiﬁed as difﬁcult to machine materials such as ceramics, glasses and silicon wafers. Machining of these materials up to nano accuracy is a great challenge in the manufacturing industry. Finishing of micro components such as micro-moulds, micro-lenses and micro-holes need different processing techniques. Conventional ﬁnishing methods used so far become almost impossible or cumbersome.

					<p>Conservative ﬂight performance of an aircraft with constant load factor was analysed by Miele. In this paper, conservative ﬂight with a varying load factor is considered. The load factor being a control parameter is varied in such a way that it gives rise to closed-form solutions to aircraft motion. With this typical load factor function the geometry of the trajectory has been found to be a loop as is with Miele’s analysis. Finally, the range and endurance have been determined for two different constant parameters associated with the load factor function.</p>

				<title>A calculation method of cracking moment for the high strength concrete beams under pure torsion</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, a method is given to calculate cracking moments of high strength reinforced concrete beams under the effect of pure torsion. To determine the method, both elastic and plastic theories were used. In this method, dimensions of beam cross-section were considered besides stirrup and longitudinal reinforcements. Two plain high strength concrete (without reinforcement) and eight high strength reinforced concrete beams which have two different cross-sections ($150 \times 250 mm$ and $150 \times 300 mm$) were produced to examine the validity of the proposed method. The predictions of the proposed approach for the calculation of the cracking moment of beams under pure torsion were compared with the experimental and the analytical results of previous studies. From these comparisons it is concluded that the predictions of the proposed equations for the cracking moment of plain and reinforced high strength concrete beams under pure torsion are closer to the experimental data compared to the analytical results of previous theories.</p>

				<title>Seismic strengthening of RC structures with exterior shear walls</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0034</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Vulnerable buildings and their rehabilitation are important problems for earthquake regions. In recent decades the goal of building rehabilitation and strengthening has gained research attention and numerous techniques have been developed to achieve this. However, most of these strengthening techniques disturb the occupants, who must vacate the building during renovation. In this study, a new strengthening alternative for RC structures, namely exterior shear walls, has been experimentally investigated under reversed cyclic loading. Using the proposed technique, it is possible to strengthen structures without disturbing their users or vacating the building during renovation. In this technique, shear walls are installed in parallel to the building’s exterior sides. It has been observed that the usage of exterior shear walls considerably improve the capacity and sway stiffness of RC structures. The experimental results have also been compared and found to be in agreement with the numerical solutions. Post attached exterior shear walls behaved as a monolithic member of the structure. Design considerations for the exterior shear wall-strengthened buildings have also been discussed in the paper.</p>

				<title>Numerical modelling of failure of cement concrete using a unit cell approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0035-0051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a unit cell based approach is followed, where a unit cell consisting of one aggregate surrounded by mortar matrix is used for numerical simulation of mechanical response of cement concrete. Unit cell approach is a simple mathematical approximation that helps us to simplify the simulation of mechanical response of multi-phase composites. To model the failure of matrix, brittle cracking model is used, where the entire fracture zone is represented by a band of micro cracked material. Current study involves; (a) failure analysis of the concrete unit cell when it is subjected to tensile loads, and (b) parametric study of variation of peak strength with shape and volume fraction of aggregate. In this study, circular and square aggregates at various orientations are modelled. The simulation results predict that the peak tensile stresses are not very sensitive to the volume fraction of aggregates, when the unit cell is subjected to tensile loads. This paper effectively demonstrates the power of unit cell model in simulating the nonlinear mechanical response of cement concrete when it is subjected to tensile loading.</p>

				<page>0065-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analytical evaluation of fracture toughness of a multilayered composite laminate was well-established using modified crack closure integral (MCCI) approach based on test data on the failure load. For this purpose the crack initiation direction, which is treated as a branch crack direction for the theoretical prediction, is required. The crack initiation direction in a multilayered composite laminate depends on mode of failure. In the present work, a fracture parameter $n^∗$ is introduced to predict the mode of failure in multilayered composite having a crack and is validated. Analytical relationship for the prediction of fracture toughness of multilayered composite between a base laminate and its constituent sublaminates is also arrived at. With available test data on the toughness of a set of sub-laminates, toughness of base laminate is determined and validated. The present approach is useful in evaluating the load carrying capability of composite structures with defects in the form of cracks and this information is valuable for design.</p>

Optimization study is carried out for obtaining the maximum buckling load with design variables as ply thickness, cut-out size and orientation of cut-out with respect to laminate. Buckling load is evaluated using a ‘simple higher order shear deformation theory’ based on four unknown displacements $u,v,w_b$ and $w_s$. A $C^1$ continuous shear flexible finite element based on HSDT model is developed using Hermite cubic polynomial. It is observed that for thick anti-symmetric laminates, the non-dimensional buckling load decreases with increase in aspect ratio and increase in fibre orientation angle. There is a decrease in the non-dimensional buckling load of symmetric laminate in the presence of cut-out.</p>

				<title>Analysis of a Lorentz force based vibration exciter using permanent magnets mounted on a piezoelectric stack</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0087-0107</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work presents performance analysis of a Lorentz force based noncontact vibration exciter by mounting a couple of permanent magnets on a piezoelectric stack. A conductor is attached to the structure to be excited and is placed midway between unlike poles of a couple of permanent magnets. The permanent magnets are placed on a piezoelectric stack. This stack, because of its nano-positioning capabilities, can impart an accurate and adjustable harmonic vibratory motion to the couple of permanent magnets. The piezoelectric stack, because of its high stiffness remains uncoupled with the dynamics of the structure. Due to the relative motion between the magnets and the conductor, Lorentz force is generated within the conductor. This Lorentz force is responsible for vibration of the structure in a plane parallel to the pole faces of the magnets. This keeps the magnetic field almost independent of the vibration of the structure and the chance of the structure hitting the magnet during large vibration is totally eliminated. If the amplitude of displacement of the stack is kept constant, the non-contact excitation force in this exciter remains proportional to the excitation frequency. Though use of this exciter eliminates mass (apart from that of the conductor attached to the structure) and stiffness coupling, a known damping term gets added to that of the excited structure.</p>

				<page>0109-0123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This experimental study is conducted to determine statistical models of cutting forces in hard turning of $AISI H11$ hot work tool steel $(\sim 50 HRC)$. This steel is free from tungsten on $Cr–Mo–V$ basis, insensitive to temperature changes and having a high wear resistance. It is employed for the manufacture of highly stressed diecasting moulds and inserts with high tool life expectancy, plastic moulds subject to high stress, helicopter rotor blades and forging dies.</p>
					<p>The workpiece is machined by a mixed ceramic tool (insert $CC650$ of chemical composition $70$%$Al_2O_3+30$%$TiC$) under dry conditions. Based on $3^3$ full factorial design, a total of 27 tests were carried out. The range of each parameter is set at three different levels, namely low, medium and high. Mathematical models were deduced by software Minitab (multiple linear regression and response surface methodology) in order to express the influence degree of the main cutting variables such as cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut on cutting force components. These models would be helpful in selecting cutting variables for optimization of hard cutting process.</p>
					<p>The results indicate that the depth of cut is the dominant factor affecting cutting force components. The feed rate influences tangential cutting force more than radial and axial forces. The cutting speed affects radial force more than tangential and axial forces.</p>

					<p>This paper reports the design and implementation of an intelligent system for detection of microcalcification from digital mammograms. A neuron based thresholding strategy has been developed to reduce the number of candidate pixels. A back propagation neural network (BPNN) classifier has been used to classify the pixels into positive (affected) and normal ones. The false positives generated in the process are eliminated using the connected component analysis and the elongated component removal algorithms in succession. Suspected areas of microcalcification are detected and marked on the mammogram. The system was rigorously tested for the available images and was found to be quite robust, consistent and fast in detection. The output image with prompts generated by the system can form an important input to a radiologist for the final diagnosis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, an effective procedure of response surface methodology (RSM) has been utilized for ﬁnding the optimal values of process parameters while induction hardening of AISI 1040 under two different conditions of the material i.e., rolled and normalized. Various process parameters, such as feed rate (speed at which the induction coil moves, which is measured in mm/sec), current, dwell time (time after which heat intensity starts to heat work piece in seconds) and gap between the work piece and induction coil have been explored by experiments. Hardness at two different conditions has been considered as performance characteristic. The experiment plan was based on rotatable, central composite design (CCD). The experimental results showed that the proposed mathematical models suggested could describe the performance indicators within the limits of the factors being investigated. The obtained optimal process parameters have been predicted and veriﬁed by conﬁrmation experiments. Microstructure and SEM (scanning electron microscope) analyses were also done for justiﬁcation of the work.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0153-0165</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper explains the task of land cover classiﬁcation using reformed fuzzy $C$ means. Clustering is the assignment of objects into groups called clusters so that objects from the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects from different clusters. The most basic attribute for clustering of an image is its luminance amplitude for a monochrome image and colour components for a colour image. Since there are more than 16 million colours available in any given image and it is difﬁcult to analyse the image on all of its colours, the likely colours are grouped together by clustering techniques. For that purpose reformed fuzzy $C$ means algorithm has been used. The segmented images are compared using image quality metrics. The image quality metrics used are peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), error image and compression ratio. The time taken for image segmentation is also used as a comparison parameter. The techniques have been applied to classify the land cover.</p>

				<title>Comparison of evolutionary computation algorithms for solving bi-objective task scheduling problem on heterogeneous distributed computing systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0167-0180</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The task scheduling problem in heterogeneous distributed computing systems is a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP). In heterogeneous distributed computing systems (HDCS), there is a possibility of processor and network failures and this affects the applications running on the HDCS. To reduce the impact of failures on an application running on HDCS, scheduling algorithms must be devised which minimize not only the schedule length (makespan) but also the failure probability of the application (reliability). These objectives are conﬂicting and it is not possible to minimize both objectives at the same time. Thus, it is needed to develop scheduling algorithms which account both for schedule length and the failure probability. Multiobjective Evolutionary Computation algorithms (MOEAs) are well-suited for Multiobjective task scheduling on heterogeneous environment. The two Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms such as Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) and Multiobjective Evolutionary Programming (MOEP) with non-dominated sorting are developed and compared for the various random task graphs and also for a real-time numerical application graph. The metrics for evaluating the convergence and diversity of the obtained non-dominated solutions by the two algorithms are reported. The simulation results conﬁrm that the proposed algorithms can be used for solving the task scheduling at reduced computational times compared to the weighted-sum based biobjective algorithm in the literature.</p>

				<title>Numerical simulation with ﬁnite element and artiﬁcial neural network of ball indentation for mechanical property estimation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0181-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A combined mechanical property evaluation methodology with ABI (Automated Ball Indentation) simulation and Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) analysis is evolved to evaluate the mechanical properties for Carbon Manganese Steel ($SA-333$ Grade-6) and Stainless Steel $(SS-304LN)$. The experimental load deﬂection data is converted into meaningful mechanical properties for these materials and their evaluated property is veriﬁed with experimental tensile specimen results. An ANN database is generated with the help of contact type ﬁnite element analysis by numerically simulating the ABI process for various magnitudes of yield strength $(\sigma_{yp}) (200 MPa–400 MPa)$ with a range of strain hardening exponent $(n) (0.05–0.5)$ and strength coefﬁcient $(K) (600 MPa–1600 MPa)$. For the present problem, a ball indenter of $1.57 mm$ diameter having Young’s modulus higher than test piece is used to minimize the error due to indenter deformation. Test piece dimension is kept large enough in comparison to the indenter conﬁguration in the simulation to minimize the deﬂection at the outer edge of the test piece. Further, this database after the neural network training; is used to analyse measured material properties of different test pieces. The ANN predictions are reconﬁrmed with contact type ﬁnite element analysis for an arbitrary selected test sample. The methodology evolved in this work can be extended to predict material properties for any irradiated nuclear material in the service. Extensions of the ABI tests and the associated database analysis could lead to evaluation of the indentation energy to fracture needed for the structural integrity assessment of aged components.</p>

				<title>Inﬂuence of interface properties on fracture behaviour of concrete</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0193-0208</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hardened concrete is a three-phase composite consisting of cement paste, aggregate and interface between cement paste and aggregate. The interface in concrete plays a key role on the overall performance of concrete. The interface properties such as deformation, strength, fracture energy, stress intensity and its inﬂuence on stiffness and ductility of concrete have been investigated. The effect of composition of cement, surface characteristics of aggregate and type of loading have been studied. The load-deﬂection response is linear showing that the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) is applicable to characterize interface. The crack deformation increases with large rough aggregate surfaces. The strength of interface increases with the richness of concrete mix. The interface fracture energy increases as the roughness of the aggregate surface increases. The interface energy under mode II loading increases with the orientation of aggregate surface with the direction of loading. The chemical reaction between smooth aggregate surface and the cement paste seems to improve the interface energy. The ductility of concrete decreases as the surface area of the strong interface increases. The fracture toughness (stress intensity factor) of the interface seems to be very low, compared with hardened cement paste, mortar and concrete.</p>

					<p>In the present investigation, we have discussed about the features of waves in different modes of wave propagation in an inﬁnitely long thermoelastic, isotropic micropolar plate, when the generalized theory of Lord–Shulman (L–S) is considered. A more general dispersion equation is obtained. The different analytic expressions in symmetric and anti-symmetric vibration for short as well as long waves are obtained in different regions of phase velocities.

				<title>In-plane anisotropy in tensile deformation and its inﬂuence on the drawability of Nimonic $c$–263 alloy sheets</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0223-0249</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An effort has been made to comprehensively evaluate and rationalize the in-plane anisotropy in tensile properties and the effect of aging on the nature of deformation (strain hardening behaviour) and formability characteristics, especially the limit drawing ratio and forming limit diagram. Despite weak crystallographic texture and excellent ductility and high work hardening exponents, the alloy sheets of $C$-263 exhibit signiﬁcant extent of in-plane anisotropy in its tensile properties and yield loci. The absolute magnitudes of yield stress and the exact nature of anisotropy that can be predicted from the tensile part of the yield locus need to be employed with caution. This is because when the magnitudes of the yield stresses, obtained from yield locus are more than 5 times higher as compared to the yield and ultimate tensile strength values and the nature and degree of in-plane anisotropy under tensile loading matches with that of only the compressive yield stresses of yield locus. The alloy sheet, due to weak crystallographic texture and relatively high strengths, is found to be far more suitable for structural applications, rather than for deep drawing applications, which was reﬂected in low limit drawing ratio values (1.34 for $CR+ST$ and 1.23 for peak aged conditions). Further, the study conducted reveals that the safer forming limits in strain space is higher for $CR+ST$ condition; while, the safer forming limits in stress space are higher for peak aged $(CR+ST+1073 K/8 h)$ condition. Finally, detailed studies are outlined to arrive at suitable microstructural and textural characteristics that provide signiﬁcantly enhanced drawability in the Nimonic $C$-263 alloy sheets.</p>

				<title>Melt pool vorticity in deep penetration laser material welding</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0251-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the vorticity of melt motion in the keyhole and weld pool has been evaluated in case of high power $CO_2$ laser beam welding. The circulation of vorticity is obtained as a function of Reynolds number for a given keyhole volume which is linked to Mach number variation. The shear stress and thermal ﬂuxes present in the turbulent pool are linked to diffusivity and Prandtl number variation. It was shown that below a critical value of Rayleigh number, the conduction mode of melt transfer signifying beam absorption becomes dominant. Above this value, convective heat transfer indicates melting and evaporation occurring in the weld pool during laser welding. The evaporative recoil pressure expels the liquid while surface tension and hydrostatic pressure help to retain the melt in the keyhole cavity in this high power laser beam welding. The understanding of several hydrodynamic phenomena occuring in the weld pool is valuable not only for understanding basic mechanistic aspects but also for process optimization involved in laser beam welding.</p>

				<title>Uncertainty modelling of critical column buckling for reinforced concrete buildings</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0267-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Buckling is a critical issue for structural stability in structural design. In most of the buckling analyses, applied loads, structural and material properties are considered certain. However, in reality, these parameters are uncertain. Therefore, a prognostic solution is necessary and uncertainties have to be considered. Fuzzy logic algorithms can be a solution to generate more dependable results. This study investigates the material uncertainties on column design and proposes an uncertainty model for critical column buckling reinforced concrete buildings. Fuzzy logic algorithm was employed in the study. Lower and upper bounds of elastic modulus representing material properties were deﬁned to take uncertainties into account. The results show that uncertainties play an important role in stability analyses and should be considered in the design. The proposed approach is applicable to both future numerical and experimental researches. According to the study results, it is seen that, calculated buckling load values are stayed in lower and upper bounds while the load values are different for same concrete strength values by using different code formula.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0293-0315</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Clustering is a process for partitioning datasets. This technique is very useful for optimum solution. $k$-means is one of the simplest and the most famous methods that is based on square error criterion. This algorithm depends on initial states and converges to local optima. Some recent researches show that $k$-means algorithm has been successfully applied to combinatorial optimization problems for clustering. In this paper, we purpose a novel algorithm that is based on combining two algorithms of clustering; $k$-means and Modify Imperialist Competitive Algorithm. It is named hybrid $K$-MICA. In addition, we use a method called modiﬁed expectation maximization (EM) to determine number of clusters. The experimented results show that the new method carries out better results than the ACO, PSO, Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Tabu Search (TS), Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO) and $k$-means.</p>

				<page>0317-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Software metrics should be used in order to improve the productivity and quality of software, because they provide critical information about reliability and maintainability of the system. In this paper, we propose a cognitive complexity metric for evaluating design of object-oriented (OO) code. The proposed metric is based on an important feature of the OO systems: Inheritance. It calculates the complexity at method level considering internal structure of methods, and also considers inheritance to calculate the complexity of class hierarchies. The proposed metric is validated both theoretically and empirically. For theoretical validation, principles of measurement theory are applied since the measurement theory has been proposed and extensively used in the literature as a means to evaluate the software engineering metrics. We applied our metric on a real project for empirical validation and compared it with Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) metrics suite. The theoretical, practical and empirical validations and the comparative study prove the robustness of the measure.</p>

				<title>On the method of calibration of the energy dispersive EXAFS beamline at Indus-2 and ﬁtting theoretical model to the EXAFS spectrum</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0339-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A procedure for calibration of the recently developed energy dispersive EXAFS beamline at the Indus-2 synchrotron source at RRCAT, Indore, India has been described. The procedure involves recording of absorption spectra of two standard samples, whose absorption edge energies are well-established. Two methods have been considered for calibration. In the ﬁrst method, the position of the ﬁrst maximum of the derivative of absorption curve is taken as the position of the edge energy. In the second method, the position of the point at half edge step in the absorption curve is taken as the position of the edge energy. It has been shown that only the ﬁrst method gives same values of dispersion even when the beam current is varied and should be used for calibrating the experimental spectra. Further, it is recommended that the performance of the beamline for a particular setting should be checked by recording and analysing EXAFS of a standard. Hence, the procedure for analysis and extracting information about the various parameters that can be determined by ﬁtting the EXAFS data with a theoretical model has also been described, by taking the example of $K$-absorption spectra of copper metal foil recorded on this beamline.</p>

					<p>X-ray lasing through high voltage, high current discharges in gas ﬁlled capillaries has been demonstrated in several laboratories. This method gives highest number of X-ray photons per pulse. The fast varying current and the $j x B$ magnetic force compress the plasma towards the axis forming a hot, dense, line plasma, wherein under appropriate discharge conditions lasing occurs. At Laser Plasma Division, RRCAT, a program on high voltage capillary discharge had been started. The system consists of a $400 kV$ Marx bank, water line capacitor, spark gap and capillary chamber. The initial results of the emission of intense short soft X-ray pulses $(5–10 ns)$ from the capillary discharge are reported.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0357-0369</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of free water content upon the compressive mechanical behaviour of cement mortar under high loading rate was studied. The uniaxial rapid compressive loading testing of a total of 30 specimens, nominally $37 mm$ in diameter and $18.5 mm$ in height, with ﬁve different saturations (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively) were executed in this paper. The technique ‘Split Hopkinson pressure bar’ (SHPB) was used. The impact velocity was $10 m/s$ with the corresponding strain rate as $10^2/s$. Water-cement ratio of 0.5 was used. The compressive behaviour of the materials was measured in terms of the maximum stress, Young’s modulus, critical strain at maximum stress and ultimate strain at failure. The data obtained from test indicates that the similarity exists in the shape of strain–stress curves of cement mortars with different water content, the upward section of the stress–strain curve shows bilinear characteristics, while the descending stage (softening state) is almost linear. The dynamic compressive strength of cement mortar increased with the decreasing of water content, the dynamic compressive strength of the saturated specimens was 23% lower than that of the totally dry specimens. With an increase in water content, the Young’s modulus ﬁrst increases and then decreases, the Young’s modulus of the saturated specimens was 23% lower than that of the totally dry specimens. No signiﬁcant changes occurred in the critical and ultimate strain value as the water content is changed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the compressive strength, thermal properties and microstructure of self-compacting concrete with different amounts of $CuO$ nanoparticles have been investigated. $CuO$ nanoparticles with an average particle size of $15 nm$ were added to self-compacting concrete and various properties of the specimens were measured. The results indicate that $CuO$ nanoparticles are able to improve the compressive strength of self-compacting concrete and reverse the negative effects of superplasticizer on compressive strength of the specimens. $CuO$ nanoparticles as a partial replacement of cement up to $4 wt.$% could accelerate $C–S–H$ gel formation as a result of the increased crystalline $Ca(OH)_2$ amount at the early ages of hydration. Increasing $CuO$ nanoparticle content to more than $4 wt.$%, causes reduced compressive strength because of unsuitable dispersion of nanoparticles in the concrete matrix. Accelerated peak appearance in conduction calorimetry tests, more weight loss in thermogravimetric analysis and more rapid appearance of peaks related to hydrated products in X-ray diffraction results, all indicate that $CuO$ nanoparticles up to $4 wt.$% could improve the mechanical and physical properties of the specimens. Finally, $CuO$ nanoparticles improved the pore structure of concrete and caused shifting of the distributed pores from harmless to low harm.</p>

					<p>Analytical studies on the effect of depth of beam and several parameters on the shear strength of reinforced concrete beams are reported. A large data base available has been segregated and a nonlinear regression analysis (NLRA) has been performed for developing the reﬁned design models for both, the cracking and the ultimate shear strengths of reinforced concrete (RC) beams without web reinforcement. The shear strength of RC beams is size dependent, which needs to be evaluated and incorporated in the appropriate size effect models. The proposed models are functions of compressive strength of concrete, percentage of ﬂexural reinforcement and depth of beam. The structural brittleness of large size beams seems to be severe compared with highly ductile small size beams at a given quantity of ﬂexural reinforcement. The proposed models have been validated with the existing popular models as well as with the design code provisions.</p>

Moreover, the numerical solutions of the non-dimensional governing partial differential equations of the problem are shown graphically. Comparisons are made with the results predicted by Green–Naghdi theory of the two types (GNII without energy dissipation) and (GNIII with energy dissipation). We found that the reinforcement has great effect on the distribution of ﬁeld quantities.

				<title>Application of a stochastic modelling framework to characterize the inﬂuence of different oxide scales on the solid particle erosion behaviour of boiler grade steel</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0425-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An earlier developed stochastic model has been applied to describe the relative rate of material loss from the steel surface subjected to simultaneous action of high temperature oxidation involving multiple oxides and mechanical erosion. Different oxide scale growths, namely, nickel, iron and chromium have been treated deterministically and erosion is described using a literature based probabilistic framework. Oxidation is described with a power law (parabolic) approach to quantify the rate of growth of all the three oxide scales. In consonance with the published model, erosion is treated using a probabilistic methodology as spatially random phenomena on the oxide surface. The concept of ‘erosion footprint’ has been incorporated in the present model to characterize the erosion-induced damage on the steel surface. The model has been applied to predict the relative material loss as a function of time resulted from erosion–oxidation interaction pertaining to nickel, iron and chromium oxides in dimensionless form. This investigation is expected to provide a quantitative understanding of relative material loss due to solid particle erosion for oxide scales, (composed of multiple oxides) formed on the steel components of coal-ﬁred boilers.</p>

					<p>Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can be deﬁned as a way of deﬁning and implementing enterprise applications that deals with the intercommunication of loosely coupled, coarse grained (business level), reusable artifacts (services). In this paper, we attempt to mathematically model the preliminary steps in the larger problem of providing an optimal architecture. The problem is treated as a complex network, particularly a process-task-network. We employ statistical and graph-theoretic methods namely, Jaccard’s distance analysis, Multiple Correspondence method and the Minimum Spanning Tree method, to ﬁnd appropriate clusters. These methods are used to cluster tasks across business processes to propose services. Additional properties and features of these clusters are discussed. We propose a leverage factor which demonstrates the importance of a task within the service and its impact on service composition.</p>

				<title>Efﬁcient explicit formulation for practical fuzzy structural analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0436-0488</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a practical approach based on High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) for analysing the response of structures with fuzzy parameters. The proposed methodology involves integrated ﬁnite element modelling, HDMR based response surface generation, and explicit fuzzy analysis procedures. The uncertainties in the material, geometric, loading and structural parameters are represented using fuzzy sets. To facilitate efﬁcient computation, a HDMR based response surface generation is employed for the approximation of the fuzzy ﬁnite element response quantity.</p>

				<title>An inverse heat transfer problem for optimization of the thermal process in machining</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0489-0504</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is evident that machining process causes development of large quantities of thermal energy within a relatively narrow area of the cutting zone. The generated thermal energy and the problems of its evacuation from the cutting zone account for high temperatures in machining. These increased temperatures exert a pronounced negative effect on the tool and workpiece. This paper takes a different approach towards identiﬁcation of the thermal process in machining, using inverse heat transfer problem. Inverse heat transfer method allows the closest possible experimental and analytical approximation of thermal state for a machining process. Based on a temperature measured at any point within a workpiece, inverse method allows determination of a complete temperature ﬁeld in the cutting zone as well as the heat ﬂux distribution on the tool/workpiece interface. By knowing the heat ﬂux function, one deﬁnes criterium and method of optimization, the inverse heat transfer problem transforms into extreme case. Now, the task of optimization is to determine most favourable ratio between heat ﬂux parameters in order to preserve exploitation properties of the tool and workpiece.</p>

				<page>0505-0514</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two different types of welds, Metal Inert Gas (MIG) and Friction Stir Welding (FSW), have been used to weld aluminum alloy 5083. The microstructure of the welds, including the nugget zone and heat affected zone, has been compared in these two methods using optical microscopy. The mechanical properties of the weld have been also investigated using the hardness and tensile tests. The results show that both the methods could successfully be used to weld such alloy. The strength of the joints is comparable to the strength of the base metal in both cases. However, FSWed samples have shown higher strength in comparison to the MIG samples. The results also show that the extension of the heat affected zone is higher in the MIG method in comparison to the FSW method. The weld metal microstructure of MIG welded specimen contains equiaxed dendrites as a result of solidiﬁcation process during MIG welding while FSWed samples have wrought microstructures.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0515-0523</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Digital watermarking is proposed as a method to enhance medical data security. Medical image watermarking requires extreme care when embedding additional information within medical images, because the additional information should not degrade medical image quality. Doctors diagnose medical images by seeing Region of Interest (ROI). A ROI of a medical image is an area including important information and must be stored without any distortion. If a medical image is illegally obtained or if its content is changed, it may lead to wrong diagnosis. In our scheme a well-known technique least signiﬁcant bit substitution (LSB) is adapted to fulﬁll the requirements of data hiding and authentication in medical images. The scheme divide Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image into two parts ROI and non-ROI (non-region of interest). The DS (Digital Signature) which include patient data and SOP Instance UID are embedded randomly into the LSB border of the image. The DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) of ROI-MSB (most signiﬁcant bit) embedded into the LSB middle of the image. The Result shows the ability to hide and retrieve DS in non-ROI, while ROI, the most important area for diagnosis, is retrieved exactly at the receiver side.</p>

				<page>0525-0550</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, dynamically balanced gait generation problem of a 7-DOF two-legged robot moving up and down through the sloping surface is presented. The gait of the lower links during locomotion is obtained after assuming suitable trajectories for the swing leg and hip joint. The trunk motion is initially generated based on the concept of static balance, which is different from the well-known semi-inverse method and then checked for its dynamic balance calculated using the concept of Zero-Moment Point (ZMP). Lagrange–Euler formulation is attempted for the determination of joint torques. Average power consumption at each joint is then determined based on the computed torques. Moreover, the variations of dynamic balance margin and average power consumption are studied for both ascending and descending through the sloping surface. Both of them are found to be more for the ascending gait generation compared to those for the descending case. The effects of variations of the slope have also been studied on the average dynamic balance margin and power consumption for both the cases.</p>

				<title>Phonetic perspectives on modelling information in the speech signal</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0555-0586</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reassesses conventional assumptions about the informativeness of the acoustic speech signal, and shows how recent research on systematic variability in the acoustic signal is consistent with an alternative linguistic model that is more biologically plausible and compatible with recent advances in modelling embodied visual perception and action. Standard assumptions about the information available from the speech signal, especially strengths and limitations of phonological features and phonemes, are reviewed, and compared with an alternative approach based on Firthian prosodic analysis (FPA). FPA places more emphasis than standard models on the linguistic and interactional function of an utterance, de-emphasizes the need to identify phonemes, and uses formalisms that force us to recognize that every perceptual decision is context- and task-dependent. Examples of perceptually-signiﬁcant phonetic detail that is neglected by standard models are discussed. Similarities between the theoretical approach recommended and current work on perception–action robots are explored.</p>

				<title>Salient phonetic features of Indian languages in speech technology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0587-0599</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Speech signal is the basic study and analysis material in speech technology as well phonetics. To form meaningful chunks of language, the speech signal should have dynamically varying spectral characteristics, sometimes varying within a stretch of a few milliseconds. Phonetics groups these temporally varying spectral chunks into abstract classes roughly called as allophones. Distribution of these allophones into higher level classes called phonemes takes us closer to their function in a language. Phonemes and letters in the scripts of literate languages – languages which use writing have varying degrees of correspondence. As such a relationship exists, a major part of speech technology deals with the correlation of script letters with chunks of time-varying spectral stretches in that language. Indian languages are said to have a more direct correlation between their sounds and letters. Such similarity gives a false impression of similarity of text-to-sound rule sets across these languages. A given letter which has parallels across various languages may have different degrees of divergence in its phonetic realization in these languages. We illustrate such differences and point out the problem areas where speech scientists need to pay greater attention in building their systems, especially multilingual systems for Indian languages.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0601-0622</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>${}^1$Time-scale representation of voiced speech is applied to voice quality analysis, by introducing the Line of Maximum Amplitude (LoMA) method. This representation takes advantage of the tree patterns observed for voiced speech periods in the time-scale domain. For each period, the optimal LoMA is computed by linking amplitude maxima at each scale of a wavelet transform, using a dynamic programming algorithm. A time-scale analysis of the linear acoustic model of speech production shows several interesting properties. The LoMA points to the glottal closure instants. The LoMA phase delay is linked to the voice open quotient. The cumulated amplitude along the LoMA is related to voicing amplitude. The LoMA spectral centre of gravity is an indication of voice spectral tilt. Following these theoretical considerations, experimental results are reported. Comparative evaluation demonstrates that the LoMA is an effective method for the detection of Glottal Closure Instants (GCI). The effectiveness of LoMA analysis for open quotient, amplitude and spectral tilt estimations is also discussed with the help of some examples.</p>

				<page>0623-0650</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glottal inverse ﬁltering (GIF) refers to methods of estimating the source of voiced speech, the glottal volume velocity waveform. GIF is based on the idea of inversion, in which the effects of the vocal tract and lip radiation are cancelled from the output of the voice production mechanism, the speech signal. This article provides a review on GIF research by examining an era spanning ﬁve decades during which this topic has been under development. The topic is handled from three main perspectives: the estimation methods of the glottal source, the parameterization techniques that have been developed to express the estimated glottal excitations in numerical forms, and the application areas of GIF. Finally, the strengths and limitations of the GIF approach are discussed.</p>

				<title>Epoch-based analysis of speech signals</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0651-0697</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Speech analysis is traditionally performed using short-time analysis to extract features in time and frequency domains. The window size for the analysis is ﬁxed somewhat arbitrarily, mainly to account for the time varying vocal tract system during production. However, speech in its primary mode of excitation is produced due to impulse-like excitation in each glottal cycle. Anchoring the speech analysis around the glottal closure instants (epochs) yields signiﬁcant beneﬁts for speech analysis. Epoch-based analysis of speech helps not only to segment the speech signals based on speech production characteristics, but also helps in accurate analysis of speech. It enables extraction of important acoustic-phonetic features such as glottal vibrations, formants, instantaneous fundamental frequency, etc. Epoch sequence is useful to manipulate prosody in speech synthesis applications. Accurate estimation of epochs helps in characterizing voice quality features. Epoch extraction also helps in speech enhancement and multispeaker separation. In this tutorial article, the importance of epochs for speech analysis is discussed, and methods to extract the epoch information are reviewed. Applications of epoch extraction for some speech applications are demonstrated.</p>

				<title>Auditory-like ﬁlterbank: An optimal speech processor for efﬁcient human speech communication</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0699-0712</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The transmitter and the receiver in a communication system have to be designed optimally with respect to one another to ensure reliable and efﬁcient communication. Following this principle, we derive an optimal ﬁlterbank for processing speech signal in the listener’s auditory system (receiver), so that maximum information about the talker’s (transmitter) message can be obtained from the ﬁlterbank output, leading to efﬁcient communication between the talker and the listener. We consider speech data of 45 talkers from three different languages for designing optimal ﬁlterbanks separately for each of them. We ﬁnd that the computationally derived optimal ﬁlterbanks are similar to the empirically established auditory (cochlear) ﬁlterbank in the human ear. We also ﬁnd that the output of the empirically established auditory ﬁlterbank provides more than 90% of the maximum information about the talker’s message provided by the output of the optimal ﬁlterbank. Our experimental ﬁndings suggest that the auditory ﬁlterbank in human ear functions as a near-optimal speech processor for achieving efﬁcient speech communication between humans.</p>

				<page>0729-0744</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Information is carried in changes of a signal. The paper starts with revisiting Dudley’s concept of the carrier nature of speech. It points to its close connection to modulation spectra of speech and argues against short-term spectral envelopes as dominant carriers of the linguistic information in speech. The history of spectral representations of speech is brieﬂy discussed. Some of the history of gradual infusion of the modulation spectrum concept into Automatic recognition of speech (ASR) comes next, pointing to the relationship of modulation spectrum processing to wellaccepted ASR techniques such as dynamic speech features or RelAtive SpecTrAl (RASTA) ﬁltering. Next, the frequency domain perceptual linear prediction technique for deriving autoregressive models of temporal trajectories of spectral power in individual frequency bands is reviewed. Finally, posterior-based features, which allow for straightforward application of modulation frequency domain information, are described. The paper is tutorial in nature, aims at a historical global overview of attempts for using spectral dynamics in machine recognition of speech, and does not always provide enough detail of the described techniques. However, extensive references to earlier work are provided to compensate for the lack of detail in the paper.</p>

				<page>0745-0782</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Traditionally, the information in speech signals is represented in terms of features derived from short-time Fourier analysis. In this analysis the features extracted from the magnitude of the Fourier transform (FT) are considered, ignoring the phase component. Although the signiﬁcance of the FT phase was highlighted in several studies over the recent three decades, the features of the FT phase were not exploited fully due to difﬁculty in computing the phase and also in processing the phase function. The information in the short-time FT phase function can be extracted by processing the derivative of the FT phase, i.e., the group delay function. In this paper, the properties of the group delay functions are reviewed, highlighting the importance of the FT phase for representing information in the speech signal. Methods to process the group delay function are discussed to capture the characteristics of the vocal-tract system in the form of formants or through a modiﬁed group delay function. Applications of group delay functions for speech processing are discussed in some detail. They include segmentation of speech into syllable boundaries, exploiting the additive and high resolution properties of the group delay functions. The effectiveness of segmentation of speech, and the features derived from the modiﬁed group delay are demonstrated in applications such as language identiﬁcation, speech recognition and speaker recognition. The paper thus demonstrates the need to exploit the potential of the group delay functions for development of speech systems.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper discusses the application of neural networks for developing different speech systems. Prosodic parameters of speech at syllable level depend on positional, contextual and phonological features of the syllables. In this paper, neural networks are explored to model the prosodic parameters of the syllables from their positional, contextual and phonological features. The prosodic parameters considered in this work are duration and sequence of pitch $(F_0)$ values of the syllables. These prosody models are further examined for applications such as text to speech synthesis, speech recognition, speaker recognition and language identiﬁcation. Neural network models in voice conversion system are explored for capturing the mapping functions between source and target speakers at source, system and prosodic levels. We have also used neural network models for characterizing the emotions present in speech. For identiﬁcation of dialects in Hindi, neural network models are used to capture the dialect speciﬁc information from spectral and prosodic features of speech.</p>

				<page>0885-0915</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we describe recent work at Idiap Research Institute in the domain of multilingual speech processing and provide some insights into emerging challenges for the research community. Multilingual speech processing has been a topic of ongoing interest to the research community for many years and the ﬁeld is now receiving renewed interest owing to two strong driving forces. Firstly, technical advances in speech recognition and synthesis are posing new challenges and opportunities to researchers. For example, discriminative features are seeing wide application by the speech recognition community, but additional issues arise when using such features in a multilingual setting. Another example is the apparent convergence of speech recognition and speech synthesis technologies in the form of statistical parametric methodologies. This convergence enables the investigation of new approaches to uniﬁed modelling for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) as well as cross-lingual speaker adaptation for TTS. The second driving force is the impetus being provided by both government and industry for technologies to help break down domestic and international language barriers, these also being barriers to the expansion of policy and commerce. Speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation are thus emerging as key technologies at the heart of which lies multilingual speech processing.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0941-0961</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Accurate modelling and exact determination of Metal Oxide (MO) surge arrester parameters are very important for arrester allocation, insulation coordination studies and systems reliability calculations. In this paper, a new technique, which is the combination of Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms and linking the MATLAB and EMTP, is proposed to estimate the parameters of MO surge arrester models. The proposed algorithm is named Modiﬁed Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (MAPSO). In the proposed algorithm, to overcome the drawback of the PSO algorithm (convergence to local optima), the inertia weight is tuned by using fuzzy rules and the cognitive and the social parameters are self-adaptively adjusted. Also, to improve the global search capability and prevent the convergence to local minima, ACO algorithm is combined to the proposed APSO algorithm. The transient models of MO surge arrester have been simulated by using ATP-EMTP. The results of simulations have been applied to the program, which is based on MAPSO algorithm and can determine the ﬁtness and parameters of different models.

				<title>Investigation of the inﬂuential parameters of machining of $AISI 304$ stainless steel</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0963-0970</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Austenitic stainless steels are hard materials to machine, due to their high strength, high ductility and low thermal conductivity. The last characteristic results in heat concentration at the tool cutting edge. This paper aims to optimize turning parameters of $AISI 304$ stainless steel. Turning tests have been performed in three different feed rates (0.2, 0.3, $0.4 mm/rev$) at the cutting speeds of 100, 125, 150, 175 and $200 m/min$ with and without cutting ﬂuid. A design of experiments (DOE) and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) have been made to determine the effects of each parameter on the tool wear and the surface roughness. It is being inferred that cutting speed has the main inﬂuence on the ﬂank wear and as it increases to $175 m/min$, the ﬂank wear decreases. The feed rate has the most important inﬂuence on the surface roughness and as it decreases, the surface roughness also decreases. Also, the application of cutting ﬂuid results in longer tool life and better surface ﬁnish.</p>

					<p>Optimal kinematic design of parallel manipulators is a challenging problem. In this work, an attempt has been made to present a generalized approach of kinematic design for a 6-legged parallel manipulator, by considering only the minimally required design parameters.

				<title>A ﬁnite element model for independent wire rope core with double helical geometry subjected to axial loads</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0995-1008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Due to the complex geometry of wires within a wire rope, it is difﬁcult to model and analyse independent wire rope core accurately (IWRC). In this paper, a more realistic three-dimensional modelling approach and ﬁnite element analysis of wire ropes are explained. Single helical geometry is enough to model simple straight strand while IWRC has a more complex geometry by inclusion of double helical wires in outer strands. Taking the advantage of the double helical wires, three-dimensional IWRCs modelling is applied for both right regular lay and lang lay IWRCs. Wire-by-wire based results are gathered by using the proposed modelling and analysis method under various loading conditions. Illustrative examples are given for those show the accuracy and the robustness of the present FE analysis scheme with considering frictional properties and contact interactions between wires. FE analysis results are compared with the analytical and available test results and show reasonable agreement with a simpler and more practical approach.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents numerical investigation of the inﬂuence of the specimen geometry, loading condition, size-effect and softening function of concrete on double-$K$ fracture parameters. The input data needed for computation of the double-$K$ fracture parameters are obtained from the well-known version of Fictitious Crack Model (FCM). FCM is developed for three standard specimens: three-point bend test, compact tension specimen and four-point bend test of size range $100–600 mm$ at relative size of initial crack length 0.3. The analysis of numerical results shows some interesting behaviour of double-$K$ fracture parameters.</p>

				<title>Size effect on strength and lifetime probability distributions of quasibrittle structures</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0031</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Engineering structures such as aircraft, bridges, dams, nuclear containments and ships, as well as computer circuits, chips and MEMS, should be designed for failure probability &lt; $10^{−6}–10^{−7}$ per lifetime. The safety factors required to ensure it are still determined empirically, even though they represent much larger and much more uncertain corrections to deterministic calculations than do the typical errors of modern computer analysis of structures. The empirical approach is sufﬁcient for perfectly brittle and perfectly ductile structures since the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of random strength is known, making it possible to extrapolate to the tail from the mean and variance. However, the empirical approach does not apply to structures consisting of quasibrittle materials, which are brittle materials with inhomogeneities that are not negligible compared to structure size. This paper presents a reﬁned theory on the strength distribution of quasibrittle structures, which is based on the fracture mechanics of nanocracks propagating by activation energy controlled small jumps through the atomic lattice and an analytical model for the multi-scale transition of strength statistics. Based on the power law for creep crack growth rate and the cdf of material strength, the lifetime distribution of quasibrittle structures under constant load is derived. Both the strength and lifetime cdfs are shown to be sizeand geometry-dependent. The theory predicts intricate size effects on both the mean structural strength and lifetime, the latter being much stronger. The theory is shown to match the experimentally observed systematic deviations of strength and lifetime histograms of industrial ceramics from the Weibull distribution.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0033-0057</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the well-known Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM) is modiﬁed to solve the fracture laminated multi-directional problems. The results are compared with the existing analytical/exact or experimental method. The already known existing ADM is modiﬁed to improve the accuracy and convergence. Thus, the modiﬁed method is named as Modiﬁed Adomian Decomposition Method (MADM). The results from MADM are found to converge very quickly, simple to apply for fracture(singularity) problems and are more accurate compared to experimental and analytical methods. MADM is quite efﬁcient and is practically well-suited for use in these problems. Several examples are given to check the reliability of the present method. In the present paper, the principle of the decomposition method is described, and its advantages form the analyses of fracture of laminated uni-directional composites.</p>

				<title>Electromagnetic and neutron emissions from brittle rocks failure: Experimental evidence and geological implications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0059-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has been observed energy emission in the form of electromagnetic radiation, clearly indicating charge redistribution, and neutron bursts, necessarily involving nuclear reactions, during the failure process of quasi-brittle materials such as rocks, when subjected to compression tests. The material used is Luserna stone, which presents a very brittle behaviour during compression failure. The observed phenomenon of high-energy particle emission, i.e., electrons and neutrons, can be explained in the framework of the superradiance applied to the solid state, where individual atoms lose their identity and become part of different plasmas, electronic and nuclear. Since the analysed material contains iron, it can be conjectured that piezonuclear reactions involving ﬁssion of iron into aluminum, or into magnesium and silicon, should have occurred during compression damage and failure. These complex phenomenologies are conﬁrmed by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) tests conducted on Luserna stone specimens, and found additional evidences at the Earth’s Crust scale, where electromagnetic and neutron emissions are observed just in correspondence with major earthquakes. In this context, the effects of piezonuclear reactions can be also considered from a geophysical and geological point of view.</p>

				<title>Fatigue de-bond growth in adhesively bonded single lap joints</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0079-0088</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fatigue de-bond growth studies have been conducted on adhesively bonded lap joint specimens between aluminium and aluminium with Redux-319A adhesive with a pre-deﬁned crack of $3 mm$ at the bond end. The correlations between fracture parameters and the de-bond growth data are established using both numerical and experimental techniques. In the numerical method, geometrically non-linear ﬁnite element analyses were carried out on adhesively bonded joint specimen for various de-bond lengths measured from the lap end along the mid-bond line of the adhesive. The ﬁnite element results were post processed to estimate the SERR components $G_I$ and $G_{II}$ using the Modiﬁed Virtual Crack Closure Integral (MVCCI) procedure. In experimental work, specimens were fabricated and fatigue de-bond growth tests were conducted at a stress ratio $R = −1$. The results obtained from both numerical analyses and testing have been used to generate de-bond growth curve and establish de-bond growth law in the Paris regime for such joints. The de-bond growth rate is primarily function of mode-I SERR component $G_I$ since the rate of growth in shear mode is relatively small. The value of Paris exponent $m$ is found to be 6.55. The high value of de-bond growth exponent in Paris regime is expected, since the adhesive is less ductile than conventional metallic materials. This study is important for estimating the life of adhesively bonded joints under both constant and variable amplitude fatigue loads.</p>

				<title>Fatigue crack growth due to overloads in plain concrete using scaling laws</title>

				<page>0107-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Scaling laws are represented in power law form and can be utilized to extract the characteristic properties of a new phenomenon with the help of self-similar solutions. In this work, an attempt has been made to propose a scaling law analytically, for plain concrete when subjected to variable amplitude loading. Due to the application of overload on concrete structures, acceleration in the crack growth process takes place. A closed form expression has been developed to capture the acceleration in crack growth rate in conjunction with the principles of dimensional analysis and self-similarity. The proposed model accounts for parameters such as, the tensile strength, fracture toughness, overload effect and the structural size. Knowing the governed and the governing parameters of the physical problem and by using the concepts of self-similarity, a relationship is obtained between the different parameters involved. The predicted results are compared with experimental crack growth data for variable amplitude loading and are found to capture the overload effect with sufﬁcient accuracy. Through a sensitivity analysis, fracture toughness is found to be the most dominant parameter in accelerating the crack length due to application of overload.</p>

				<page>0133-0147</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents methodologies for residual strength evaluation of concrete structural components using linear elastic and nonlinear fracture mechanics principles. The effect of cohesive forces due to aggregate bridging has been represented mathematically by employing tension softening models. Various tension softening models such as linear, bilinear, trilinear, exponential and power curve have been described with appropriate expressions. These models have been validated by predicting the remaining life of concrete structural components and comparing with the corresponding experimental values available in the literature. It is observed that the predicted remaining life by using power model and modiﬁed bi-linear model is in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. Residual strength has also been predicted using these tension softening models and observed that the predicted residual strength is in good agreement with the corresponding analytical values in the literature. In general, it is observed that the variation of predicted residual moment with the chosen tension softening model follows the similar trend as in the case of remaining life. Linear model predicts large residual moments followed by trilinear, bilinear and power models.</p>

				<title>Quasi-static crack tip ﬁelds in rate-sensitive $FCC$ single crystals</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0149-0169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, the effects of loading rate, material rate sensitivity and constraint level on quasi-static crack tip ﬁelds in a $FCC$ single crystal are studied. Finite element simulations are performed within a mode I, plane strain modiﬁed boundary layer framework by prescribing the two term $(K −T)$ elastic crack tip ﬁeld as remote boundary conditions. The material is assumed to obey a rate-dependent crystal plasticity theory. The orientation of the single crystal is chosen so that the crack surface coincides with the crystallographic (010) plane and the crack front lies along $[10\bar{1}]$ direction. Solutions corresponding to different stress intensity rates $\dot{K}$, $T$-stress values and strain rate exponents $m$ are obtained. The results show that the stress levels ahead of the crack tip increase with $\dot{K}$ which is accompanied by gradual shrinking of the plastic zone size. However, the nature of the shear band patterns around the crack tip is not affected by the loading rate. Further, it is found that while positive $T$-stress enhances the opening and hydrostatic stress levels ahead of crack tip, they are considerably reduced with imposition of negative $T$-stress. Also, negative $T$-stress promotes formation of shear bands in the forward sector ahead of the crack tip and suppresses them behind the tip.</p>

				<page>0171-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the methodologies for damage tolerant evaluation of stiffened panels under fatigue loading. The two major objectives of damage tolerant evaluation, namely, the remaining life prediction and residual strength evaluation of stiffened panels have been discussed. Concentric and eccentric stiffeners have been considered. Stress intensity factor for a stiffened panel has been computed by using parametric equations of numerically integrated modiﬁed virtual crack closure integral technique. Various methodologies for residual strength evaluation, namely, plastic collapse condition, fracture toughness criterion and remaining life approach have been described. Effect of various stiffener sizes and stiffener type (concentric and eccentric stiffeners) on remaining life and residual strength has been studied under constant amplitude load. From the studies, it has been observed that the predicted life is signiﬁcantly higher with concentric and eccentric stiffener cases compared to the respective unstiffened cases. The percentage increase in life is relatively more in the case of concentric stiffener compared to that of eccentric stiffener case for the same stiffener size and moment of inertia. From the studies, it has also been observed that the predicted residual strength using remaining life approach is lower compared to other methods, namely, plastic collapse condition and fracture toughness criterion and hence remaining life approach will govern the design. It is noted that residual strength increases with the increase of stiffener size.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presents a model, based on nonlinear fracture mechanics, for analysing crack propagation in quasi-brittle materials, such as concrete. The work is limited to two-dimensions, and therefore, the fracture modes of interest are mode I (pure tension) and mode II (pure shear). The constitutive model has been implemented in the context of the ﬁnite element method using interface elements. The fracture is simulated through a discrete crack represented by the interface with a cohesive crack stress-separation relation derived from the model, which is based on a fracture criterion, together with a ﬂow rule and a softening law. The model is used for simulating results from an experimental study on beams with centric and eccentric notches of high and normal strength concretes, and explaining other test results available in the literature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the effects of bafﬂe blocks located in the ﬂow channel on fuel cell characteristics were investigated. The higher current densities were obtained from the cells with blockage than without blockage. It was observed that the gap between the tip of the bafﬂe block and the channel wall had a signiﬁcant effect on the current density produced and on the convergence of solutions. The number and the size of blocks that are providing the highest current density from the cell were determined. No signiﬁcant effects were observed in the polarization curves for cells with more than four blocks and gap ratio of 0.3. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of the relative humidity and velocity of inlet gases on cells with four blocks and gap ratio of 0.3. It was concluded that the current density is strongly dependent on the relative humidity for low inlet velocities and on the other hand, on the inlet velocity for low relative humidities.</p>

				<title>Multi-objective parametric optimization of powder mixed electro-discharge machining using response surface methodology and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0223-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Powder mixed electro-discharge machining (EDM) is being widely used in modern metal working industry for producing complex cavities in dies and moulds which are otherwise difﬁcult to create by conventional machining route. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the presence of suspended particle in dielectric ﬂuid signiﬁcantly increases the surface ﬁnish and machining efﬁciency of EDM process. Concentration of powder (silicon) in the dielectric ﬂuid, pulse on time, duty cycle, and peak current are taken as independent variables on which the machining performance was analysed in terms of material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (SR). Experiments have been conducted on an EZNC fuzzy logic Die Sinking EDM machine manufactured by Electronica Machine Tools Ltd. India. A copper electrode having diameter of $25 mm$ is used to cut $EN 31$ steel for one hour in each trial. Response surface methodology (RSM) is adopted to study the effect of independent variables on responses and develop predictive models. It is desired to obtain optimal parameter setting that aims at decreasing surface roughness along with larger material removal rate. Since the responses are conﬂicting in nature, it is difﬁcult to obtain a single combination of cutting parameters satisfying both the objectives in any one solution. Therefore, it is essential to explore the optimization landscape to generate the set of dominant solutions.

				<title>A review of designing machine tool for leanness</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0241-0259</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As an ideology, Leanness is not a new concept but still researchers strive for developing new methods to reduce almost all kinds of identiﬁed wastages at almost every stage and in every activity — right from design till delivery of ﬁnal product to the end-customer. Newly developed manufacturing ideologies, paradigms and systems are always critically examined from the point of view of leanness. In other words, leanness is becoming an important evaluation tool to compare the recently developed/pioneered approaches. There has been a gradual evolution of the leanness over the years from the shop ﬂoor level of a manufacturing (automobile) organization to almost every operational and management aspect now. The Leanness has undergone and still is undergoing a process of continuous and never-ending evolution due to its inherently built dynamic concept of continuous improvement. Although in the literature a lot of work has been reported to the application of lean tools, principles, theories and methodologies to production systems, but a very few is evident in the area of Lean design process of a product and machine tool. For this reason an attempt is being made here to focus a signiﬁcant proportion of this paper on evolutionary aspect of leanness from manufacturing to design stage. Also, this paper reviews the concepts and practices being followed till date by the industrialists, researchers and academicians in applying lean tools and techniques in the design of product and machine tools along with the methods to measure the lean improvements in the systems.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0261-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One-dimensional discrete element model for the ballistic impact is used to determine the depth of penetration of a bullet on a thick target. Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a numerical tool where a continuum is modelled as a network of masses connected by normal springs. A one-dimensional discrete element model is developed to obtain the displacements and forces associated with the ballistic impact on a thick target. The depth of penetration of the penetrator into the target is calculated from these DEM results. The simulated results of depth of penetration are found to be in reasonable agreement with the simulation results of other numerical approaches that are available in the literature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Assessing the capacity of existing building as per the present codes of practice is an important task in performance-based evaluation. In order to enhance the performance of existing buildings to the present level of ductile design prescribed by present codes and ﬁnd the retroﬁt or design a rehabilitation system, there is an urgent need to assess accurately the actual lateral load resistance and the potential failure modes. In this paper, a typical 6-storey reinforced concrete (RC) building frame is designed for four design cases as per the provisions in three revisions of $IS$: 1893 and $IS$: 456 and it is analysed using user-deﬁned (UD) nonlinear hinge properties or default-hinge (DF) properties, given in $SAP 2000$ based on the $FEMA-356$ and $ATC-40$ guidelines. An analytical procedure is developed to evaluate the yield, plastic and ultimate rotation capacities of RC elements of the framed buildings and these details are used to deﬁne user-deﬁned inelastic effect of hinge for columns as $P-M-M$ and for beams as $M3$ curves. A simpliﬁed three parameter model is used to ﬁnd the stress–strain curves of RC elements beyond the post yield region of conﬁned concrete. Building performance of structural components in terms of target building performance levels are studied with the nonlinear static analysis. The possible differences in the results of pushover analysis due to default- and user-deﬁned nonlinear component properties at different performance levels of the building are studied.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the work for the EnConversion of input Punjabi sentences to an interlingua representation called Universal Networking Language (UNL). The UNL system consists of two main components, namely, EnConverter (used for converting the text from a source language to UNL) and DeConverter (used for converting the text from UNL to a target language). This paper discusses the framework for designing the EnConverter for Punjabi language with a special focus on generation of UNL attributes and relations from Punjabi source text. It also describes the working of Punjabi Shallow Parser used for the processing of the input sentence, which performs the tasks of Tokenizer, Morph-analyzer, Part-of-Speech Tagger and Chunker. This paper also considers the seven phases used in the process of EnConversion of input Punjabi text to UNL representation. The paper highlights the EnConversion analysis rules used for the EnConverter and indicates its usage in the generation of UNL expressions. This paper also covers the results of implementation of Punjabi EnConverter and its evaluation on sample UNL sentences available at Spanish Language Server. The accuracy of the developed system has also been presented in this paper.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0319-0340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The stochastic ﬁnite element analysis of elliptic type partial differential equations is considered. A reduced method of the spectral stochastic ﬁnite element method using polynomial chaos is proposed. The method is based on the spectral decomposition of the deterministic system matrix. The reduction is achieved by retaining only the dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The response of the reduced system is expanded as a series of Hermite polynomials, and a Galerkin error minimization approach is applied to obtain the deterministic coefﬁcients of the expansion. The moments and probability density function of the solution are obtained by a process similar to the classical spectral stochastic ﬁnite element method. The method is illustrated using three carefully selected numerical examples, namely, bending of a stochastic beam, ﬂow through porous media with stochastic permeability and transverse bending of a plate with stochastic properties. The results obtained from the proposed method are compared with classical polynomial chaos and direct Monte Carlo simulation results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Corrosion is one of the detrimental phenomena which reduces strength of structures. It is common practice to assume a uniform thickness reduction for general corrosion. Since the actual corroded plate has rough surfaces, to estimate the remaining strength of corroded structures, typically a much higher level of accuracy is required. The main aim of present work is to study plastic collapse load of corroded steel plates with irregular surfaces under tension. Non-linear ﬁnite element method by using computer code $ANSYS$ was employed to determine plastic collapse load. By comparing the results with uniform thickness assumption, a reduction factor was proposed. It is found that by uniform thickness assumption, plastic collapse load of corroded plates are overestimated.</p>

				<title>Simulation–optimization model for groundwater contamination remediation using meshfree point collocation method and particle swarm optimization</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0351-0369</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Remediation of the groundwater contamination problem is a tedious, time consuming and expensive process. Pump and treat (PAT) is one of the commonly used techniques for groundwater remediation in which the contaminated groundwater is pumped, treated and put back to the aquifer system or other sources. Developing simulation-optimization (S/O) model proved to be very useful in the design process of an effective PAT system. Simulation models help in predicting the spatial and temporal variation of the contamination plume while optimization models help in minimizing the cost of pumping. Generally, grid or mesh based models such as Finite Difference Method (FDM) or Finite Element Methods (FEM) is used for the groundwater ﬂow and transport simulation. But it is found that grid/mesh generation is a time consuming process. Therefore, recently Meshfree (MFree) based numerical models are developed to avoid this difﬁculty of meshing and remeshing. MFree Point Collocation Method (PCM) is a simple meshfree method used for the simulation of coupled groundwater ﬂow and contaminant transport. For groundwater optimization problems, even though number of methods such as linear programming, nonlinear programming, etc. are available, evolutionary algorithm based techniques such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are found to be very effective. In this paper, a simulation model using MFree PCM for conﬁned groundwater ﬂow and transport and a PSO based single objective optimization model are developed and coupled to get an effective S/O model for groundwater remediation using PAT. The S/O model based on PCM and PSO is applied for a polluted hypothetical conﬁned aquifer and its performance is compared with Finite Element Method–Binary Coded Genetic Algorithm (FEM–GA) model. It is found that both the models are in good agreement with each other showing the applicability of the present approach. The PCM–PSO based S/O model is simple and more effective in groundwater contamination remediation design using PAT.</p>

					<p>In this paper, a wavelet packet transform (WPT)-based robust video watermarking algorithm is proposed. A visible meaningful binary image is used as the watermark. First, sequent frames are extracted from the video clip. Then, WPT is applied on each frame and from each orientation one sub-band is selected based on block mean intensity value called robust sub-band. Watermark is embedded in the robust sub-bands based on the relationship between wavelet packet coefﬁcient and its 8-neighbour $(D_8)$ coefﬁcients considering the robustness and invisibility. Experimental results and comparison with existing algorithms show the robustness and the better performance of the proposed algorithm.</p>

				<title>Effects of ﬂy ash ﬁneness on the mechanical properties of concrete</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0389-0403</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study reviews the effects of ﬂy ash ﬁneness on the compressive and splitting tensile strength of the concretes. A ﬂy ash of lignite origin with Blaine ﬁneness of $2351 cm^2/g$ was ground in a ball mill. As a consequence of the grinding process, ﬂy ashes with ﬁneness of $3849 cm^2/g$ and $5239 cm^2/g$ were obtained. Fly ashes with three different ﬁneness were used instead of cement of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% and ten different types of concrete mixture were produced. In the concrete mixtures, the dosage of binder and water/cement ratio were ﬁxed at $350 kg/m^3$ and 0.50, respectively. Slump values for the concretes were adjusted to be $100 \pm 20 mm$. Cubic samples were cast with edges of $100 mm$. The specimens were cured in water at $20^\circ C$. At the end of curing process, compressive and splitting tensile strengths of the concrete samples were determined at 7, 28, 56, 90, 120 and 180 days.</p>
					<p>It was observed that compressive and splitting tensile strength of the concretes was affected by ﬁneness of ﬂy ash in short-and long-terms. It was found that compressive and tensile strength of the concretes increased as ﬂy ash ﬁneness increased. It was concluded that Blaine ﬁneness value should be above $3849 cm^2/g$ ﬁneness of ﬂy ash to have positive impact on mechanical properties of concrete. The effects of ﬂy ash ﬁneness on the compressive and splitting tensile strength of the concretes were remarkably seen in the ﬂy ash with $FAC$ code with ﬁneness of $5235 cm^2/g$.</p>

				<page>0405-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A class of stabilizing decentralized proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers for an $n$-link robot manipulator system is proposed. The range of decentralized PID controller parameters for an $n$-link robot manipulator is obtained using Kharitonov theorem and stability boundary equations. Basically, the proposed design technique is based on the gain-phase margin tester and Kharitonov’s theorem that synthesizes a set of PID controllers for the linear model while nonlinear interaction terms involve in system dynamics are treated as zero. The stability analysis of the composite system with the designed set of decentralized PID controllers is investigated by incorporating bounding parameters of interconnection terms in $LMI$ formulation. From the range of controller gains obtained by the proposed method, a genetic algorithm is adopted to get an optimal controller gains so that the tracking error is minimum. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed control scheme for solution of ﬁxed as well as time-varying trajectory tracking control problems.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0425-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Digital watermarking is an application associated with copyright protection. Any digital object can be used as a carrier to carry information. If the information is related to object then it is known as a watermark which can be visible or invisible. In the era of digital information, there are multiple danger zones like copyright and integrity violations, of digital object. In case of any dispute during rights violation, content creator can prove ownership by recovering the watermark. Two most important prerequisites for an efﬁcient watermarking scheme are robustness and security. Watermark must be robust and recoverable even if a part of content is altered by one or more attacks like compression, ﬁltering, geometric distortions, resizing, etc. In this work, we propose a blind watermarking scheme based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD). Singular values (SV’s) of high frequency (HH) band are used to optimize perceptual transparency and robustness constraints. Although most of the SVD-based schemes prove to be robust, little attention has been paid to their security aspect. Therefore, we introduce a signaturebased authentication mechanism at the decoder to improve security. Resulting blind watermarking scheme is secure and robust.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Feature extraction is one of the important tasks in face recognition. Moments are widely used feature extractor due to their superior discriminatory power and geometrical invariance. Moments generally capture the global features of the image. This paper proposes Krawtchouk moment for feature extraction in face recognition system, which has the ability to extract local features from any region of interest. Krawtchouk moment is used to extract both local features and global features of the face. The extracted features are fused using summed normalized distance strategy. Nearest neighbour classiﬁer is employed to classify the faces. The proposed method is tested using $ORL$ and Yale databases. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to recognize images correctly, even if the images are corrupted with noise and possess change in facial expression and tilt.</p>

The equations of motion for graphene sheet are derived using non-local local elasticity theory. Levy’s approach has been used to solve the governing equations for various boundary conditions of the graphene sheet. Present results from Levy’s solution agree with the results for all edges simply supported available in the literature. Further, the effect of the (i) non-local parameter, (ii) size of the graphene sheet and (iii) various boundary conditions on the critical buckling loads of the graphene sheets are investigated.

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple method of analysis is presented to determine the inﬂuence of single shear walls (SSW) on the degree of coupling DoC and on the peak shear demand PSD for beams of coupled shear walls (CSW) in mixed shear wall structures (MSW). Non-coupled lateral load resisting structures such as singular planar walls and cores will reduce primary bending moments in the coupled shear wall bents of MSW structures thereby increasing the degree of coupling. They will also change the location and magnitude of the maximum shear in and rotation of the coupling beams. These changes in the coupled wall bents may increase the demand on their performance beyond capacity. It is, therefore, important to have an indication of the change in the coupling beam design parameters at an early stage of the design. The proposed graphical method is based on the continuous medium theory and allows a rapid assessment of the structural behaviour of coupled shear wall bents in mixed shear wall structures that are subject to horizontal loading.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of carbon ﬁbre-reinforced, silicon carbide composites by soft-solution approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0493-0502</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of the present work centers on synthesizing and characterizing carbon ﬁbre $(C_f)$ reinforced, silicon carbide matrix composites which are considered to have potential applications in aerospace and automobile industry. A series of composites, namely the $C_{f-}SiC$, $C_{f-}(SiC+ZrC)$, $C_{f-}(SiC+ZrB_2)$, and $C_{f-}(SiC+ZrO_2)$, have been prepared by a proposed soft-solution approach. This approach involves the use of water-soluble precursors of colloidal silica, sucrose, zirconium oxychloride, and boric acid as sources of silica, carbon, zirconia, and boron oxide, respectively to achieve the desired matrices through drying, carbonization and carbothermal reduction. The prepared powders and the composites were characterized by thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses to assess the phase formation and microstructure of the materials, apart from assessment of their tensile properties. The study shows that the soft-solution process yields matrices with ﬁner crystallite sizes, having homogeneous distribution of the constituent phases of either the powders or of the composite matrices. The role of the additional phases on the tensile properties of the composites has been discussed using consideration of thermal stresses at ﬁbre-matrix interface; whereas the role of the carbothermal reduction temperature in determining these properties has been explained using the interfacial characteristics of the ﬁbre-matrix. Addition of $ZrO_2$ in the matrix of $SiC$ has shown to improve the properties of $C_{f-}SiC$ composites considerably. The results of this investigation unambiguously demonstrate that aqueous solution-based processing can be used for fabrication of these composites in relatively shorter time in an environmental friendly manner without using any expensive equipment. The approach is capable of yielding composites with different phases in the matrix by simple variation of precursor materials and solutions. The small crystallite sizes, ﬁne particle distribution and low carbothermal reduction temperatures are some of the speciﬁc merits of the proposed method.</p>

					<p>The present study is aimed at ﬁlling the gaps in scientiﬁc understanding of the burnishing process, and also to aid and arrive at technological solutions for the surface modiﬁcations based on burnishing of some of the commonly employed engineering materials. The effects of various burnishing parameters on the surface characteristics, surface microstructure, micro hardness are evaluated, reported and discussed in the case of $EN$ Series steels ($EN 8, EN 24$ and $EN 31$), Aluminum alloy (AA6061) and Alpha-beta brass. The burnishing parameters considered for studies principally are burnishing speed, burnishing force, burnishing feed and number of passes. Taguchi technique is employed in the present investigation to identify the most inﬂuencing parameters on surface roughness. Effort is also made to identify the optimal burnishing parameters and the factors for scientiﬁc basis of such optimization. Finally, a brief attempt is made to construct the Burnishing maps with respect to strength level (in this case, average micro hardness of unburnished material).</p>

				<title>Decentralized linear quadratic power system stabilizers for multi-machine power systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0521-0537</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Linear quadratic stabilizers are well-known for their superior control capabilities when compared to the conventional lead–lag power system stabilizers. However, they have not seen much of practical importance as the state variables are generally not measurable; especially the generator rotor angle measurement is not available in most of the power plants. Full state feedback controllers require feedback of other machine states in a multi-machine power system and necessitate block diagonal structure constraints for decentralized implementation. This paper investigates the design of Linear Quadratic Power System Stabilizers using a recently proposed modiﬁed Heffron–Phillip’s model. This model is derived by taking the secondary bus voltage of the step-up transformer as reference instead of the inﬁnite bus. The state variables of this model can be obtained by local measurements. This model allows a coordinated linear quadratic control design in multi machine systems. The performance of the proposed controller has been evaluated on two widely used multimachine power systems, 4 generator 10 bus and 10 generator 39 bus systems. It has been observed that the performance of the proposed controller is superior to that of the conventional Power System Stabilizers (PSS) over a wide range of operating and system conditions.</p>

				<title>Fuzzy clustering of mechanisms</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0539-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the course of development of Mechanical Engineering, a large number of mechanisms (that is, linkages to perform various types of tasks) have been conceived and developed. Quite a few atlases and catalogues were prepared by the designers of machines and mechanical systems. However, often it is felt that a clustering technique for handling the list of large number of mechanisms can be very useful,if it is developed based on a scientiﬁc principle. In this paper, it has been shown that the concept of fuzzy sets can be conveniently used for this purpose, if an adequate number of properly chosen attributes (also called characteristics) are identiﬁed. Using two clustering techniques, the mechanisms have been classiﬁed in the present work and in future, it may be extended to develop an expert system, which can automate type synthesis phase of mechanical design. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this type of clustering of mechanisms has not been attempted before. Thus, this is the ﬁrst attempt to cluster the mechanisms based on some quantitative measures. It may help the engineers to carry out type synthesis of the mechanisms.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0557-0568</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, a twin-axis gantry has been structured to examine hydraulic driven positioning skills of the curvilinear motions based on ISO 230-4 standard entitled ‘Circular tests for numerically controlled machine tools’. The system is controlled by a path and position control module of a PLC device. As a result of the experiments conducted based on the full factorial design, the effects of piston diameter, feed rate, radius and their two-way interactions on the circularity error are determined through analysis of variance. Accordingly, minimum circularity error is obtained with the piston diameter of $63 mm$, inertia load of $12.5 kg$, radius of $5 mm$ and feed rate of $50 mm/min$ as $0.345 mm$. Circularity error increases with the increase of inertia load, radius and feed rate, and declines with the increase of piston diameter. Lastly, piston diameter has the greatest effect on the circularity error change and followed by radius, feed rate, piston diameter–radius, radius–feed rate, piston diameter-feed-rate, inertia load, piston diameter–inertia load, and inertia load–radius factors and interactions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Friction and wear behaviour of $MoS_2$, boric acid, graphite and $TiO_2$ at four different sliding speeds (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, $2.5 m/s$) has been compared with dry sliding condition. $MoS_2$ and graphite show 30 to 50% reduction in mass loss compared to other lubricants at all sliding speeds. Friction coefﬁcient reduces with increase in sliding speeds for all the conditions. Friction coefﬁcient of dry as well as lubricant coated samples varies from 0.2 to 0.55 with $MoS_2$ showing the lowest value (0.2). Boric acid and $TiO_2$ coated samples show high friction coefﬁcients at higher sliding speeds due to poor lubricity and adherence. This could also be due to sliding resistance offered by lubricant coated samples with predominant asperities interaction. $MoS_2$ and graphite coated samples also generated lowest frictional temperature compared to other conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Friction stir processing (FSP) has been developed by several researchersto produce an upper surface modiﬁcation of metallic materials. The fabrication of TiC particulate $(\sim 2 \mu m)$ reinforced aluminum matrix composite (AMC) using FSP is studied in this paper. The measured content of $TiC$ powders were compacted into a groove of $0.5 mm \times 5.5 mm$. A single pass FSP was carried out using a tool rotational speed of $1600 rpm$, processing speed of $60 mm/min$ and axial force of $10 kN$. A tool made of $HCHCr$ steel, oil hardened to $62 HRC$, having a cylindrical proﬁle was used in this study. The microstructure and microhardness of the fabricated AMC were analysed. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs revealed a uniform distribution of $TiC$ particles which were well-bonded to the matrix alloy. The hardness of the AMC increased by 45% higher than that of the matrix alloy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the bead-on-plate welds were made on $AA5083-H321$ alloy plates using both tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding and laser beam (LB) welding processes to study the enhancement of mechanical properties such as weld yield strength and hardness. The low heat input of laser beam welding effectively reduced the size of the fusion zone and heat affected zone compared to tungsten inert gas welding process. High speed LB welding and fast heating and cooling of LB welding process hinders grain growth compared to TIG welding process. The effect of vapourization of volatile alloying elements is also considered. It seems that magnesium evaporation is relatively less in LB welding compared to TIG welding. Tensile testing of the welded joints revealed that LB welding results in superior mechanical properties. It is concluded that LB welding process is more suitable to join $AA5083-H321$.</p>

				<page>0595-0607</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Over 15 million tons of ﬂy ash (FA) and 3 million tons of phosphogypsum (PG) are produced in Turkey every year. The utilization of these industrial by-product materials is important in terms of environmental and economical issues are concerned. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the technical possibilities of incorporating FA and PG in production of building blocks. Various mixtures were prepared by incorporating these industrial wastes by replacing clay with seven different weight proportions (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30%). All specimens were ﬁred at $1000^\circ C$ peak temperature. The physical and mechanical properties of all specimens such as; unit weight, compressive strength, ﬂexural strength, dimensional stability and water absorption values were recorded. The effect of PG incorporation on the properties of samples seems to be more dominant than the effect of FA incorporation. The test results showed that; PG incorporation increased the unit weight and mechanical strength values while lowering the water absorption values. Utilization of these wastes additives is not only for conservation of clay resources, but also an alternative solution to a difﬁcult and expensive waste disposal problems.</p>

					<p>Mesoscale models are highly competent for understanding behaviour of unreinforced masonry structures. Their only limitation is large computational expense. Fully Equivalent Operational Model forms an equivalent mathematical model to represent a particular phenomenon where explicit relationship between inputs and outputs are unknown. This paper explores the ability of a major variant of High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) technique, namely Cut-HDMR, to construct the most efﬁcient Fully Equivalent Operational Model for nonlinear ﬁnite element analysis of mesoscale model of an unreinforced masonry structure. Conclusions are reached on various aspects such as, suitability of interpolation schemes and order of Cut-HDMR approximation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nanoscience and nanotechnology continue to grow as ﬁelds of scientiﬁc research and commercial development as many fundamental properties are size dependent on the nano scale. There are so many techniques for the production and characterization of various ultra ﬁne powders. To gain a fundamental understanding of size dependant properties of matter in the nanometer size regimes and to developnanoscale materials into useful devices to beneﬁt society requires detailed study of the experimental methods, better methods of sample preparation of mono dispersed material in large quantities, and development of nanoparticles characterization methods. Exploding wire method is one such method for the production of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles capable of producing bulk amount of metal nanoparticles at low cost. With the intention of developing better exploding wire system for the production of nanoparticle and to understand the nanoparticle formation process, we have developed two systems in the way of optimization of the experimental set-up for ﬁnal production of nanoparticles. The detail analysis of the systems and its effect on the nanoparticles has been described in the paper.</p>

				<title>Reducing friction-induced vibration using intelligent active force control (AFC) with piezoelectric actuators</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0637-0655</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a novel approach to reduce the effect of mode coupling that causes friction induced vibration (FIV) is proposed by applying an intelligent active force control (AFC)-based strategy employing piezoelectric actuators with hysteresis effect to a simpliﬁed two degree-of-freedom mathematical model of a friction-induced vibration system. At ﬁrst, the model is simulated and analysed using a closed loop pure Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Later, it is integrated with the intelligent AFC with fuzzy logic (FL) estimator and simulated under similar operating condition. After running several tests with different sets of operating and loading conditions, the results both in time and frequency domains show that the PID controller with the intelligent AFC is much more effective in reducing the vibration, compared to the pure PID controller alone.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The performance of multilayers has been widely investigated in metal/metal systems. Shrinking this system down to less than $10 nm$ dislocation blocking occurs. We should thus try to ﬁnd a way to get a structure with less dislocation, and/or strain because low diffusivity ultra high vacuum chamber is the basic requirements for growing ultra thin ﬁlms and nano scale materials. We used William–Hall relation based on Scherr equation in X-ray powder spectrum and drawn the stress–strain diagrams. It shows that $Al–Fe–Cr–Ti$ composites have very low diffusivity and equilibrium solubility in $Al$ (0.05 at.% $Fe$, &gt;0.02 at.% $Cr$, and &gt;0.3 at.% $Ti$). $Al–Ti– Fe–Cr$ composite powders have also been prepared from sol–gel method starting from elemental powders at both ambient and elevated temperatures. The obtained results from XRD (X-ray Diffraction), AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) and X-ray powder techniques indicate that nano-grains with 0.03 at %$Cr$ can cause a reduction of leakage current through the $SS$ chamber due to its amorphous structure.</p>

				<title>Comparison of multi-objective evolutionary approaches for task scheduling in distributed computing systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0675-0694</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Parallel and distributed systems play an important part in the improvement of high performance computing. In these type of systems task scheduling is a key issue in achieving high performance of the system. In general, task scheduling problems have been shown to be $NP$-hard. As deterministic techniques consume much time in solving the problem, several heuristic methods are attempted in obtaining optimal solutions. This paper presents an application of Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and a Non-dominated Sorting Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (NSPSO) to schedule independent tasks in a distributed system comprising of heterogeneous processors. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to obtain schedules achieving minimum makespan and ﬂowtime. The applied algorithms generate Pareto set of global optimal solutions for the considered multi-objective scheduling problem. The algorithms are validated against a set of benchmark instances and the performance of the algorithms evaluated using standard metrics. Experimental results and performance measures infer that NSGA-II produces quality schedules compared to NSPSO.</p>

				<page>0709-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, an efﬁcient similarity measure technique is proposed for medical image registration. The proposed approach is based on the Gerschgorin circles theorem. In this approach, image registration is carried out by considering Gerschgorin bounds of a covariance matrix of two compared images with normalized energy. The beauty of this approach is that there is no need to calculate image features like eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This technique is superior to other well-known techniques such as normalized cross-correlation method and eigenvalue-based similarity measures since it avoids the false registration and requires less computation. The proposed approach is sensitive to small defects and robust to change in illuminations and noise. Experimental results on various synthetic medical images have shown the effectiveness of the proposed technique for detecting and locating the disease in the complicated medical images.</p>

Data embedding can be completely recovered from the watermarked image after the watermark has been extracted. In the proposed method, we utilize standard stream cipher for image encryption and selecting non-region of interest tile to embed patient data. We show that the lower bound of the PSNR (peak-signal-to-noise-ratio) values for medical images is about $48 dB$. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can embed a large amount of data while keeping high visual quality of test images.</p>

				<page>0731-0737</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) samples containing the chromium salt have been investigated using differential microcalorimetry, conductometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis. The effect of chromium on OPC hydration was evaluated by continuous observing of early hydration. The microcalorimetrical results show that with increasing the share of chromium salt, heat maximums assume lower values and the occurrence of the maximum registered in the earlier hydration times. Conductometrical measurements show that with increasing addition of chromium salt, curve did not show any speciﬁc shape, immediate drop in speciﬁc conductivity is noticed and the maximum is reached earlier. This coincides with microcalorimetrical results. It can be concluded that the addition of chromium does not affect the mechanism of the hydration process, but it does affect the kinetic parameters and dynamics of the cement hydration process. It was found that chromium salt addition to the cement–water system is acceptable up to $2 wt$.%. According to standard $EN$ 196-3 for OPC, the beginning of binding time should occur after 60 minutes. Increased amount of chromium over $2 wt$.% signiﬁcantly accelerate the beginning of binding time and for the system it is not acceptable.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Speech is one of the most important communication channels among the people. Speech Recognition occupies a prominent place in communication between the humans and machine. Several factors affect the accuracy of the speech recognition system. Much effort was involved to increase the accuracy of the speech recognition system, still erroneous output is generating in current speech recognition systems. Telugu language is one of the most widely spoken south Indian languages. In the proposed Telugu speech recognition system, errors obtained from decoder are analysed to improve the performance of the speech recognition system. Static pronunciation dictionary plays a key role in the speech recognition accuracy. Modiﬁcation should be performed in the dictionary, which is used in the decoder of the speech recognition system. This modiﬁcation reduces the number of the confusion pairs which improves the performance of the speech recognition system. Language model scores are also varied with this modiﬁcation. Hit rate is considerably increased during this modiﬁcation and false alarms have been changing during the modiﬁcation of the pronunciation dictionary. Variations are observed in different error measures such as $F$-measures, error-rate and Word Error Rate (WER) by application of the proposed method.</p>

				<page>0003-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we discuss the optimization of chemical composition, processing (forging and rolling) and heat treatment parameters to obtain the best combination of mechanical properties in case of a $Fe–15Cr–5Ni–4Cu$ precipitation hardenable stainless steel. The $\varepsilon$-copper precipitates that form during aging are spherical in shape and coherent with the matrix and principally provide strengthening in this alloy. The orientation relationship is found to be Kurdjumov–Sachs (K–S), which is common in fcc–bcc systems. Results obtained from metallurgical evaluation (mechanical property and metallography) on 15–5 $PH$ alloy during type certiﬁcation on 3 different melts were used for the optimization, attempted in this study. The mechanical properties following strain deformation has been carried out using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). In the aged conditions, the 15–5 $PH$ alloy exhibited brittle failure with extensive cleavage and/or quasicleavage fracture. This paper reports all results and also factually shows that indigenously developed and produced 15–5 $PH$ stainless steel matches in its properties with the equivalent aeronautical grade precipitation hardening stainless steels globally produced by internationally renowned manufactures.</p>

The cavitation erosion of 21-4-$N$ and $13/4$ steels was investigated by means of an ultrasonic vibration processor. The cavitation erosion is highly dependent on microstructure and mechanical properties. The results show that hot rolled 21-4-$N$ steel is more cavitation erosion resistant than the $13/4$ and 21-4-$N$ steels in as cast condition. The eroded surfaces were analysed through optical microscope and scanning electron microscope for study of erosion mechanisms.</p>

				<title>Global stability-based design optimization of truss structures using multiple objectives</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0068</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper discusses the effect of global stability on the optimal size and shape of truss structures taking into account of a nonlinear critical load, truss weight and serviceability at the same time. The nonlinear critical load is computed by arc-length method. In order to increase the accuracy of the estimation of critical load (ignoring material nonlinearity), an eigenvalue analysis is implemented into the arc-length method. Furthermore, a pure pareto-ranking based multi-objective optimization model is employed for the design optimization of the truss structure with multiple objectives. The computational performance of the optimization model is increased by implementing an island model into its evolutionary search mechanism. The proposed design optimization approach is applied for both size and shape optimization of real world trusses including 101, 224 and 444 bars and successful in generating feasible designations in a large and complex design space. It is observed that the computational performance of pareto-ranking based island model is better than the pure pareto-ranking based model. Therefore, pareto-ranking based island model is recommended to optimize the design of truss structure possessing geometric nonlinearity</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0069-0088</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article aims to propose a novel seismic strengthening technique for non-seismically detailed beam–column joints of existing reinforced concrete buildings, typical of the pre-1975 construction practice in Turkey. The technique is based on mounting pre-fabricated $SIFCON$ composite corner and plate blocks on joints with anchorage rods. For the experimental part three $2/3$ scale exterior beam–column joint specimens were tested under quasi-static cyclic loading. One of them was a control specimen with non-seismic details, and the remaining two with the same design properties were strengthened with composite blocks with different thickness and anchorage details. Results showed that the control specimen showed brittle shear failure at low drift levels, whereas in the strengthened specimens, plastic hinge formation moved away from column face allowing specimens to fail in ﬂexure. The proposed technique greatly improved lateral strength, stiffness, energy dissipation, and ductility.</p>

				<title>Elastic buckling strength of corroded steel plates</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0089-0099</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Corrosion makes structures more vulnerable to buckling and yielding failures. It is common practice to assume a uniform thickness reduction for general corrosion. To estimate the remaining strength of corroded structures, typically a much higher level of accuracy is required, since the actual corroded structures have irregular surfaces. Elastic buckling of simply supported rectangular corroded plates are studied with one- and both-sided irregular surfaces. Eigenvalue analysis by using ﬁnite element method (FEM) is employed for computing Euler stress. The inﬂuence of various geometric and corrosion characteristics are investigated and it is found that the aspect ratio of the plate, the average thickness diminution, the standard deviation of thickness diminution and the amount of corrosion loss have inﬂuence on the reduction of buckling strength of the corroded plates. Buckling strength of one- and both-sided corroded plates are the same. In plates with low value of aspect ratio, reduction of buckling strength is negligible. Reduction of buckling strength is more prominent in plates with higher aspect ratio. Reduction of buckling strength is very sensitive to the amount of corrosion loss; the higher the amount of corrosion loss, the more reduction of buckling strength. Reduction of buckling strength is less sensitive to the standard deviation of thickness diminution.</p>

					<p>Due to increase in the satelite launch activities from many countries around the world the orbital debris issue has become a major concern for the space agencies to plan a collision-free orbit design. The risk of collisions is calculated using the in situ measurements and available models. Spatial density models are useful in understanding the long-term likelihood of a collision in a particular region of space and also helpful in pre-launch orbit planning. In this paper, we present a method of estimating model parameters such as number of peaks and peak locations of spatial density model using continuous wavelets. The proposed methodology was experimented with two line element data and the results are presented.</p>

				<title>ROI-based DICOM image compression for telemedicine</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0123-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many classes of images contain spatial regions which are more important than other regions. Compression methods capable of delivering higher reconstruction quality for important parts are attractive in this situation. For medical images, only a small portion of the image might be diagnostically useful, but the cost of a wrong interpretation is high. Hence, Region Based Coding (RBC) technique is signiﬁcant for medical image compression and transmission. Lossless compression schemes with secure transmission play a key role in telemedicine applications that help in accurate diagnosis and research. In this paper, we propose lossless scalable RBC for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images based on Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) and with distortion limiting compression technique for other regions in image. The main objective of this work is to reject the noisy background and reconstruct the image portions losslessly. The compressed image can be accessed and sent over telemedicine network using personal digital assistance (PDA) like mobile.</p>

				<title>Semantic intrusion detection with multisensor data fusion using complex event processing</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0169-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an emerging technology for processing and identifying patterns of interest from multiple streams of events in real$/$near real time. Sensor network-based security and surveillance is a topic of recent research where events generated from distributed sensors at an unpredictable rate need to be analysed for possible threats and respond in a timely manner. Traditional software architectures like client$/$server architecture where the interactions are pull-based (DBMS) do not target the efﬁcient processing of streams of events in real time. CEP which is a push-based system can process streaming data to identify the intrusion patterns in near real time and respond to the threats. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on single sensor may fail to give accurate identiﬁcation of intrusion. Hence there is a need for multisensor based IDS. A multisensor-based IDS enables identiﬁcation of the intrusion patterns semantically by correlating the events and context information provided by multiple sensors. JDL multisource data fusion model is a well-known research model ﬁrst established by the Joint Directorate Laboratories. This paper proposes JDL fusion framework-based CEP for semantic intrusion detection. The events generated from heterogeneous sensors are collected, aggregated using logical and spatiotemporal relations to form complex events which model the intrusion patterns. The proposed system is implemented and the results show that the proposed system out performs the pull-based solutions in terms of detection accuracy and detection time.</p>

					<p>The issue of energy saving nowadays is very crucial. Pneumatic systems, constituting an important segment of almost every industry, represent large energy consumers. Also, a signiﬁcant problem with servo pneumatic actuators is achieving accuracy in positioning. The higher the positioning accuracy, the higher the compressed air consumption is. This paper presents a new solution of the positioning control algorithm which uniﬁes digital control of variable structure and sliding working mode and inter chamber cross-ﬂow. The experiments demonstrated that this control algorithm provides a satisfactory positioning accuracy and robustness of the system, simultaneously reducing compressed air consumption by as much as 29.5%.</p>

				<title>Wear monitoring of single point cutting tool using acoustic emission techniques</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0211-0234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper examines the ﬂank and crater wear characteristics of coated carbide tool inserts during dry turning of steel workpieces. A brief review of tool wear mechanisms is presented together with new evidence showing that wear of the $TiC$ layer on both ﬂank and rake faces is dominated by discrete plastic deformation, which causes the coating to be worn through to the underlying carbide substrate when machining at high cutting speeds and feed rates. Wear also occurs as a result of abrasion, as well as cracking and attrition, with the latter leading to the wearing through the coating on the rake face under low speed conditions. When moderate speeds and feeds are used, the coating remains intact throughout the duration of testing. Wear mechanism maps linking the observed wear mechanisms to machining conditions are presented for the ﬁrst time. These maps demonstrate clearly that transitions from one dominant wear mechanism to another may be related to variations in measured tool wear rates. Comparisons of the present wear maps with similar maps for uncoated carbide tools show that $TiC$ coatings dramatically expand the range of machining conditions under which acceptable rates of tool wear might be experienced. However, the extent of improvement brought about by the coatings depends strongly on the cutting conditions, with the greatest beneﬁts being seen at higher cutting speeds and feed rates. Among these methods, tool condition monitoring using Acoustic Techniques (AET) is an emerging one. Hence, the present work was carried out to study the stability, applicability and relative sensitivity of AET in tool condition monitoring in turning.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0235-0246</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluid ﬂow mechanisms present in Keyhole (KH) during Laser Beam Welding (LBW) process inﬂuence the associated heat and mass transfer. In an attempt to describe these complexities for eventual optimization of LBW parameters, a dimensionless analysis using Mach (Ma), Raleigh (Ra), Reynolds (Re) and Marangoni (Mg) numbers have been carried out. This analysis describes hydrodynamics of melt and vapour phase appearing in the front and rear wall of KH. The non-dimensional hydrodynamic quantities describe the mechanism behind ﬂow pattern present in meltvapour in terms of ratio of convection–conduction heat transfer occurring within KH. The analysis shows that the higher Marangoni number indicates stronger Marangoni convection in the KH causing relatively higher capillary ﬂow in the melt pool. The laminar-turbulent ﬂow of melt-vapour in KH medium is described in terms of ratio of Reynolds and Mach numbers (Re/Ma). The pressure distribution in the KH accounts for the melt-vapour ejection rate. A relationship between depth and radius of KH has been obtained as a function of delivered laser power.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Unmanned air vehicles (UAV) and especially quadrotors have drawn great attention in recent years because of their maneuverability, ease of design and control. Most of the works concentrate mostly on control; yet, design and communication are also some sub-topics. In this research, a stationary, four rotor air vehicle with limited/controlled degree of freedom is constructed so that various control algorithms and their changing effects with varying vehicle dynamics can be studied on the ground for safety purposes. Ascending/descending, pitch/yaw/roll motions can be limited/controlled by setting the vehicle’s degree of freedom mechanically, resulting better net observability of the control algorithms on the vehicle’s dynamic performance. Design, in terms of mechanics, mechatronics and software is presented and the usability of the system is shown. Parallel self tuning fuzzy $PD + PD$ control is applied to the system for preliminary studies and results are discussed. Inspite of the sensor noise, satisfactory pitch/roll/yaw control is achieved.</p>

					<p>Sintered nickel powder is proposed to be used as porous wicks in loop heat pipes used for space applications such as satellites and space crafts. In this work, the manufacturing procedure for tubular wicks through novel Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) route is discussed. Nickel powder, Polypropylene powder and thermoplastic binder are used to produce feedstock for injection moulding. Ideal sintering condition identiﬁed as $900^\circ C$ and 60 minutes. Porosity, pore diameter of the wicks are evaluated by geometric measurements using an electronic weight measuring machine and a micrometer and extrusion ﬂow Porosimeter, respectively. Permeability was calculated according to the Carmen–Kozeny equation. Experimental ﬁnding shows that porosity level of 55 vol%, average pore diameter of $2.6 \mu m$, permeability of $1.94 \times 10^{−12} m^2$ and roundness of 5% have been achieved in the porous wick. SEM investigation of pore structures shows the presence of large pores which leads to enhanced porosity and interconnected ﬁne pore network responsible for generation of required capillary pumping pressure.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>RF characterization and packaging of a single pole single throw (SPST) direct contact microelectromechanical (MEMS) series radio frequency (RF) switch is reported. Precise thickness of the silicon MEMS structure is achieved using a specially developed silicon Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) thinning process. A stress free release process is employed which ensures a high yield of released microstructures. The design of the device is based on stiffness equations derived from ﬁrst principles. Displacement of the actuator under applied ﬁeld is measured to conﬁrm electrostatic pull in, which occurs in the $30–50 V$ range. The variation of contact resistance with time has been measured and is found to have a power law decay, in agreement with theoretical models. At the bare die level the insertion loss, return loss and the isolation of the switch were measured to be $−0.43 dB, −25 dB$ and $−21 dB$, respectively at $10 GHz$. The devices were packaged in commercially available RF packages and mounted in alumina boards for post package characterization. Due to the presence of bond wires in the signal path of the packaged devices, the RF performance was found to degrade at high frequencies. However, losses were measured to be at acceptable levels up to $2 GHz$. Factors contributing to insertion loss at the die and package device levels are discussed in detail with possible solutions.</p>

				<title>Geotechnical properties of some organoclays</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0317-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The engineering characteristics of clay are dependant on its mineral and chemical structure. When the clay soils interacted with water, their volume and shear strength and compressibility properties change gradually. Large amount of decrease in terms of the shear strength of clay soils due to swelling is observed. In order to solve these problems, the stabilization of clay soils using chemical additives is a prevalent subject of research. In view of this, previous research studies have employed surface active surfactants to modify the fundamental properties of soft clays. In this study, surfactant–clay complexes (organoclays) were developed using a raw clay modiﬁcation with four surfactants and their geotechnical properties were determined in laboratory conditions. Two of the surfactants are cationic (cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, denoted as CTAC and quaternised ethoxylated fatty amine, denoted as QEFA) and the others are anionic (linear alkylbenzene sulphonic acid, denoted as LABSA and sodium lauryl ether sulphate, denoted as SLES). The experimental results indicated that the geotechnical properties of organoclays show signiﬁcant change when compared to those of natural clay. The speciﬁc gravities, unconﬁned compression strengths and maximum dry densities of all organoclays were decreased. Optimum moisture content and swelling pressure values were decreased in cationic surfactant modiﬁed clays. However, the optimum moisture content and swelling pressure values of anionic surfactant clays are increased. A direct shear test was performed to determine the shear strength of organoclays. The test results also showed that the internal friction angles of organoclays were increased. Additionally, the change in the hydraulic conductivity was found to be insigniﬁcant.</p>

				<title>Space vector-based analysis of overmodulation in triangle-comparison based PWM for voltage source inverter</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0331-0358</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The equivalence of triangle-comparison-based pulse width modulation (TCPWM) and space vector based PWM (SVPWM) during linear modulation is well-known. This paper analyses triangle-comparison based PWM techniques (TCPWM) such as sine-triangle PWM (SPWM) and common-mode voltage injection PWM during overmodulation from a space vector point of view. The average voltage vector produced by TCPWM during overmodulation is studied in the stationary $(a–b)$ reference frame. This is compared and contrasted with the average voltage vector corresponding to the well-known standard two-zone algorithm for space vector modulated inverters. It is shown that the two-zone overmodulation algorithm itself can be derived from the variation of average voltage vector with TCPWM. The average voltage vector is further studied in a synchronously revolving $(d-q)$ reference frame. The RMS value of low-order voltage ripple can be estimated, and can be used to compare harmonic distortion due to different PWM methods during overmodulation. The measured values of the total harmonic distortion (THD) in the line currents are presented at various fundamental frequencies.

				<title>Apparatus and method for heat-run test on high-power PWM converters with low energy expenditure</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0359-0375</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Before installation, a voltage source converter is usually subjected to heat-run test to verify its thermal design and performance under load. For heat-run test, the converter needs to be operated at rated voltage and rated current for a substantial length of time. Hence, such tests consume huge amount of energy in case of high-power converters. Also, the capacities of the source and loads available in the research and development (R &amp; D) centre or the production facility could be inadequate to conduct such tests. This paper proposes a method to conduct heat-run tests on highpower, pulse width modulated (PWM) converters with low energy consumption. The experimental set-up consists of the converter under test and another converter (of similar or higher rating), both connected in parallel on the ac side and open on the dc side. Vector-control or synchronous reference frame control is employed to control the converters such that one draws certain amount of reactive power and the other supplies the same; only the system losses are drawn from the mains. The performance of the controller is validated through simulation and experiments. Experimental results, pertaining to heat-run tests on a high-power PWM converter, are presented at power levels of $25 kVA$ to $150 kVA$.</p>

				<title>Effective enhancement of classiﬁcation of respiratory states using feed forward back propagation neural networks</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0377-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In biomedical signal analysis, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks are frequently used for classiﬁcation, owing to their capability to resolve nonlinearly separable problems and the ﬂexibility to implement them on-chip processor, competently. Artiﬁcial Neural Network for a classiﬁcation task attempts to hand design a network topology and to ﬁnd a set of network parameters using a back propagation training algorithm. This work presents an intelligent diagnosis system using artiﬁcial neural network. Features were extracted from respiratory effort signal based on the threshold-based scheme and the respiratory states were classiﬁed into normal, sleep apnea and motion artifacts. The introduced neural classiﬁer was then trained with different back propagation training algorithms and the classiﬁed output was compared with the hand designed results. Five different back propagation training algorithms were used for training, such as Levenberg–Marquardt, scaled conjugate gradient, BFGS algorithm, one step secant and Powell–Beale restarts. Our results revealed that the system could correctly classify at an average of 98.7%, when the LM training method was used. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and confusion matrix showed that the LM method conferred a more balanced and an apt classiﬁcation of sleep apnea and normal states.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0397-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Major emphasis, in compressed sensing (CS) research, has been on the acquisition of sub-Nyquist number of samples of a signal that has a sparse representation on some tight frame or an orthogonal basis, and subsequent reconstruction of the original signal using a plethora of recovery algorithms. In this paper, we present compressed sensing data acquisition from a different perspective, wherein a set of signals are reconstructed at a sampling rate which is a multiple of the sampling rate of the ADCs that are used to measure the signals. We illustrate how this can facilitate usage of anti-aliasing ﬁlters with relaxed frequency speciﬁcations and, consequently, of lower order.</p>

				<title>Single pass kernel $k$-means clustering method</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0407-0419</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In unsupervised classiﬁcation, kernel $k$-means clustering method has been shown to perform better than conventional $k$-means clustering method in identifying non-isotropic clusters in a data set. The space and time requirements of this method are $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the data set size. Because of this quadratic time complexity, the kernel $k$-means method is not applicable to work with large data sets. The paper proposes a simple and faster version of the kernel $k$-means clustering method, called single pass kernel $k$-means clustering method. The proposed method works as follows. First, a random sample $\mathcal{S}$ is selected from the data set $\mathcal{D}$. A partition $\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}$ is obtained by applying the conventional kernel $k$-means method on the random sample $\mathcal{S}$. The novelty of the paper is, for each cluster in $\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}$ , the exact cluster center in the input space is obtained using the gradient descent approach. Finally, each unsampled pattern is assigned to its closest exact cluster center to get a partition of the entire data set. The proposed method needs to scan the data set only once and it is much faster than the conventional kernel $k$-means method. The time complexity of this method is $O(s^2+t+nk)$ where $s$ is the size of the random sample $\mathcal{S}$, $k$ is the number of clusters required, and $t$ is the time taken by the gradient descent method (to ﬁnd exact cluster centers). The space complexity of the method is $O(s^2)$. The proposed method can be easily implemented and is suitable for large data sets, like those in data mining applications. Experimental results show that, with a small loss of quality, the proposed method can signiﬁcantly reduce the time taken than the conventional kernel $k$-means clustering method. The proposed method is also compared with other recent similar methods.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This experimental investigation was conducted to determine the effects of cutting conditions on surface roughness and cutting forces in hard turning of $X38CrMoV5-1$. This steel was hardened at $50 HRC$ and machined with CBN tool. This is employed for the manufacture of helicopter rotor blades and forging dies. Combined effects of three cutting parameters, namely cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut, on the six performance outputs-surface roughness parameters and cutting force components, are explored by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Optimal cutting conditions for each performance level are established. The relationship between the variables and the technological parameters is determined through the response surface methodology (RSM), using a quadratic regression model. Results show how much surface roughness is mainly inﬂuenced by feed rate and cutting speed. The depth of cut exhibits maximum inﬂuence on cutting force components as compared to the feed rate and cutting speed.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0447-0459</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Post-buckling analysis of composite beams with axially immovable ends is investigated using an Intuitive formulation. Intuitive formulation uses two parameters namely critical buckling load and axial stretching force developed in the post-buckled domain of composite beam. Geometric nonlinearity of von-Karman type is taken into consideration which accounts for membrane stretching action of the beam. Axial stretching force developed in post-buckled domain of composite beam is evaluated by using an axial governing equation and is expressed either in terms of lateral displacement function as an integrated value, or as a function of both axial and lateral displacement functions at any discrete location of the beam. The available expressions of critical buckling load and derived expressions of axial stretching force developed in the beam are used for obtaining an approximate closed-form expressions for the post-buckling loads of various beam boundary conditions. Numerical accuracy of the proposed analytical closed-form expressions obtained from the intuitive formulation are compared to the available ﬁnite element solutions for symmetric and asymmetric lay-up schemes of laminated composite beam. Effect of central amplitude ratio and lay-up orientation on post-buckling load variation is brieﬂy discussed for various beam boundary conditions considered in this study.</p>

				<title>Analysis of the quality renovated continuous steel casting roller</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0477-0490</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the possibility of restoration of worn contact surfaces of rollers for continuous casting of steel. Permanent effort of steel producers to extend the lifespan of these components requires the implementation of new ﬁller materials or modifying technological renovation processes to reduce the economic costs. This matter seems to be very important for the world leaders in steel production, e.g., ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel, but also for smaller concerns such as Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, Salzgitter, etc. Renovation of continuous steel casting rollers, made of $X12Cr13$ EN 10088-1-97, was realised using submerged arc surfacing technology. Worn surface of roller was machined and surfaced using one interlayer and two cover layers. The quality of deposited layers was veriﬁed using non-destructive and destructive tests. The inﬂuence of ﬁller material on the tribological properties of contact surfaces of deposited layers was analysed by abrasive wear test. Studies were made in the inﬂuence of surfacing parameters on cladding metal mixing (mixed) with base metal and also inﬂuence of heat introduced by welding using metallographic analysis. The experiments conﬁrmed very good wear resistance of the applied ﬁller metal due to dispersion strengthening caused by ﬁnely dispersed carbides and nitrides in the weld coating. The measures to be taken into account in renovation of rollers using hard surfacing, as well as the development of research in this area were also given. The experiments have conﬁrmed that parameters used are suitable for studying ﬁller materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents an experimental and statistical study on noise level generated during of rock sawing by circular diamond sawblades. Inﬂuence of the operating variables and rock properties on the noise level are investigated and analysed. Statistical analyses are then employed and models are built for the prediction of noise levels depending on the operating variables and the rock properties. The derived models are validated through some statistical tests. It is found that increasing of peripheral speed, traverse speed and cutting depth result in an increase in noise levels. On the other hand, a decreasing trend for noise levels is initially observed with the increasing of ﬂow rate of cooling ﬂuid. It is also determined that there are moderate correlations between uniaxial compressive strength, density and noise levels. Furthermore, the modelling results reveal that the predictive models have high potentials as guidance for practical applications.</p>

					<p>In the present study, AISI 8620 steel was plasma paste borided by using various $B_2O_3$ paste mixture. The plasma paste boriding process was carried out in a dc plasma system at temperatures of 973, 1023 and 1073 $K$ for 2, 5 and 7 $h$ in a gas mixture of 70% $H_2$ $-30$% $Ar$ under a constant pressure of $10 mbar$. The properties of the boride layer were evaluated by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Vickers micro-hardness tester and the growth kinetics of the boride layers. X-ray diffraction analysis of boride layers on the surface of the steel revealed $FeB$ and $Fe_2B$ phases.

					<p>In this study, the case properties and diffusion kinetics of $GS18NiMoCr36 (GS18), GS22NiMoCr56 (GS22)$ and $GS32NiCrMo6.4 (GS32)$ gear steels borided in Ekabor-II powder were investigated by conducting a series of experiments at temperatures of 1123, 1173 and 1223 $K$ for 2, 4 and 6 $h$. The boride layer was characterized by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction technique and microVickers hardness tester. X-ray diffraction analysis of boride layers on the surface of the steels revealed the existence of $FeB, Fe_2B, CrB$ and $Cr_2B$ compounds. The thickness of the boride layer increases by increasing boriding time and temperature for all steels. The hardness of the boride compounds formed on the surface of the steels $GS18, GS22$ and $GS32$ ranged from 1624 to 1905 $HV_{0,05}$, 1702 to 1948 $HV_{0,05}$, and 1745 to 2034 $HV_{0,05}$ respectively, whereas Vickers hardness values of the untreated steels $GS18, GS22$ and $GS32$ were 335 $HV_{0,05}$, 358 $HV_{0,05}$ and 411 $HV_{0,05}$, respectively. The activation energies $(Q)$ of borided steels were $228.644 kJ/mol$ for $GS18, 280.609 kJ/mol$ for $GS22$ and $294.359 kJ/mol$ for $GS32$. The growth kinetics of the boride layers forming on the $GS18, GS22$ and $GS32$ steels and the thickness of boride layers were also investigated.</p>

				<title>An efﬁcient technique to solve combined economic and emission dispatch problem using modiﬁed Ant colony optimization</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0545-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Economic load dispatch is one of the vital purposes in electrical power system operation, management and planning. Economic dispatch problem is one of the most important problems in electric power system operation. In large scale system, the problem is more complex and difﬁcult to ﬁnd out optimal solution because it is nonlinear function and it contains number of local optimal. Combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) problem is to schedule the committed generating units outputs to meet the required load demand at minimum operating cost with minimum emission simultaneously. The main aim of economic load dispatch is to reduce the total production cost of the generating system and at the same time the necessary equality and inequality constraints should also be fulﬁlled. This leads to the development of CEED techniques. There are various techniques proposed by several researchers to solve CEED problem based on optimization techniques. But still some problems such as slower convergence and higher computational complexity exist in using the optimization techniques such as GA for solving CEED problem. This paper proposes an efﬁcient and reliable technique for combined fuel cost economic optimization and emission dispatch using the Modiﬁed Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (MACO) to produce better optimal solution. The simulation results reveal the signiﬁcant performance of the proposed MACO approach.</p>

				<page>0557-0569</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Structural damage will change the dynamic characteristics, including natural frequencies, modal shapes, damping ratios and modal ﬂexibility matrix of the structure. Modal ﬂexibility matrix is a function of natural frequencies and mode shapes and can be used for structural damage detection and health monitoring. In this paper, experimental modal ﬂexibility matrix is obtained from the ﬁrst few lower measured natural frequencies and incomplete modal shapes. The optimization problem is then constructed by minimizing Frobenius norm of the change of ﬂexibility matrix. Gauss–Newton method is used to solve the optimization problem, where the sensitivity of ﬂexibility matrix with respect to structural parameters is calculated iteratively by only using the ﬁrst few lower modes. The optimal solution corresponds to structural parameters which can be used to identify damage sites and extent. Numerical results show that ﬂexibility-based method can be successfully applied to identify the damage elements and is robust to measurement noise.</p>

				<title>An evolutionary approach for colour constancy based on gamut mapping constraint satisfaction</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0571-0589</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many colour constancy algorithms have been proposed to achieve a good performance in this ﬁeld. The gamut mapping algorithm is one of the most accurate and promising algorithms based on gamut assumption: illuminant can be estimated by comparing the colours distribution in the current image to acanonical gamut (i.e., a pre-learned distribution of colours). However, the gamut mapping algorithm is precise but it is time consuming. Therefore, some other methods such as GCIE (gamut constrained illuminant estimation) and CGM (cubical gamut mapping) have been proposed which work faster. However, the results of such methods are poor when the source light is not in the pre-deﬁned ones. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm for colour constancy based on gamut mapping assumption. This approach overcomes the mentioned problem in other gamut-based methods. The proposed evolutionary method uses a simple chromosome structure together with simple operators such as mutation, selection, and reproduction. Two versions of the proposed methods have been presented here. The ﬁrst one works on image pixels, while the second one tries on image derivative. The experiments were done on three different data sets that are used in literature and results were satisfactory. The results showed that the proposed method is much improved when compared to other related methods in most of the time especially in the case of real world images.</p>

				<title>A comparative study of explicit and implicit modelling of subsegmental speaker-speciﬁc excitation source information</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0591-0620</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the explicit and implicit modelling of the subsegmental excitation information are experimentally compared. For explicit modelling, the static and dynamic values of the standard Liljencrants–Fant (LF) parameters that model the glottal ﬂow derivative (GFD) are used. A simpliﬁed approximation method is proposed to compute these LF parameters by locating the glottal closing and opening instants. The proposed approach signiﬁcantly reduces the computation needed to implement the LF model. For implicit modelling, linear prediction (LP) residual samples considered in blocks of $5 ms$ with shift of $2.5 ms$ are used. Different speaker recognition studies are performed using NIST-99 and NIST-03 databases. In case of speaker identiﬁcation, the implicit modelling provides signiﬁcantly better performance compared to explicit modelling. Alternatively, the explicit modelling seem to be providing better performance in case of speaker veriﬁcation. This indicates that explicit modelling seem to have relatively less intra and inter-speaker variability. The implicit modelling on the other hand, has more intra and inter-speaker variability. What is desirable is less intra and more inter-speaker variability. Therefore, for speaker veriﬁcation task explicit modelling may be used and for speaker identiﬁcation task implicit modelling may be used. Further, for both speaker identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation tasks the explicit modelling provides relatively more complimentary information to the state-of-the-art vocal tract features. The contribution of the explicit features is relatively more robust against noise. We suggest that the explicit approach can be used to model the subsegmental excitation information for speaker recognition.</p>

				<title>A novel image inpainting technique based on median diffusion</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0621-0644</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Image inpainting is the technique of ﬁlling-in the missing regions and removing unwanted objects from an image by diffusing the pixel information from the neighbourhood pixels. Image inpainting techniques are in use over a long time for various applications like removal of scratches, restoring damaged/missing portions or removal of objects from the images, etc. In this study, we present a simple, yet unexplored (digital) image inpainting technique using median ﬁlter, one of the most popular nonlinear (order statistics) ﬁlters. The median is maximum likelihood estimate of location for the Laplacian distribution. Hence, the proposed algorithm diffuses median value of pixels from the exterior area into the inner area to be inpainted. The median ﬁlter preserves the edge which is an important property needed to inpaint edges. This technique is stable. Experimental results show remarkable improvements and works for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous background. PSNR (quantitative assessment) is used to compare inpainting results.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0645-0651</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper formulates a new design technique for an area and energy efficient Universal NAND gate. The proposed robust three transistors (3T) based NAND gate is just as effective for dynamic power control in CMOS VLSI circuits for System on Chip (SoC) applications. The 3T NAND gate is intuitively momentous and lead to better performance measures in terms of dynamic power, reduced area and high speed while maintaining comparable performance than the other available NAND gate logic structures. Simulation tests were performed by employing standard Berkeley Predictive Technology Model (BPTM) $22 nm, 45 nm$ and $90 nm$ process technologies. The experiment and simulation results show that, the proposed 3T NAND gate effectively outperforms the basic CMOS NAND gate with excellent driving capability and signal integrity with exact output logic levels.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0653-0665</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A high-efﬁciency zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) step-up DC–DC converter is proposed. The proposed ZVS DC–DC step-up converter has ﬁxed switching frequency, simple control, and high efﬁciency. All power switches can operate with ZVS. The output diodes are under zero-current-switching (ZCS) during turn-off. Due to soft-switching operation of the power switches and output diodes, the proposed ZVS DC–DC converter shows high efﬁciency. Steady-state analysis of the converter is presented to determine the circuit parameters. A laboratory prototype of the proposed converter is developed, and its experimental results are presented for validation.</p>

				<title>Compact solid state radio frequency ampliﬁers in $kW$ regime for particle accelerator subsystems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0667-0678</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radio frequency and Microwave (RFM) infrastructure test facility is under development at RRCAT for evaluating and powering, subsystems of particle accelerator. As a part of this facility, design of $20–30 kW$ UHF solid state power ampliﬁers is in progress. For this work, design procedure has been formulated for the development of solid state ampliﬁer modules, radial combiner, divider and directional coupler; with speciﬁcations suited to RFM power system for particle accelerator. Methodology has been demonstrated by developing two different compact ampliﬁers with power output of $2 kW$ each, operating at $352 MHz$ and $505.8 MHz$, respectively. This paper describes underlying design principles and indigenous development of these ampliﬁers, consisting of 270–$300 W$ ampliﬁer modules, 8-way $2 kW$ radial combiner/divider and directional couplers. Design methodology for power combiner has been extended by physically realizing higher power $(4 kW)$ 16-way power combiner and 2-way combiner $(8 kW)$ for higher power $(8 kW)$ ampliﬁer conﬁguration planned. Simple design, indigenous technology, high efﬁciency and ease of fabrication, are the main features of this design.</p>

				<title>Metallurgical and mechanical characterization of mild steel-mild steel joint formed by microwave hybrid heating process</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0679-0686</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, mild steel–mild steel (MS-MS) joints fabricated through microwave hybrid heating (MHH) have been characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron probe micro analyser (EPMA), Vicker’s microhardness measurement and tensile strength. The XRD spectrum of the developed joints shows substitution type of solid solution form in the joint zone. The back scattered electron (BSE) images of the joint obtained by SEM show complete melting of powder particle and consequently diffusion bonding takes place between the substrate and the powder particle. The electron probe micro analysis shows diffusion of element across the joint. The Vicker’s micro hardness of the joints was measured to be $420 \pm 30 Hv$, which is higher than that of substrate hardness $230 \pm 10 Hv$. The tensile strength of the sample was measured by an universal testing machine and found to be $240 MPa$ which is about 50% of base material strength. The SEM micrographs of the fractured sample indicate mixed modes of failure during fracture of the joint; both ductile and brittle modes of failures occurred as indicated by dimple and cleavage of the brittle faces, respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This study focuses on both formulation of vegetable-based cutting ﬂuids (VBCFs) and machining with these cutting ﬂuids. For this purpose, characterizations of chemical and physical analyses of these formulated cutting ﬂuids are carried out. In this study, performances of three VBCFs developed from crude sunﬂower oil, reﬁned sunﬂower oil, reﬁned canola oil and commercial semi-synthetic cutting ﬂuid are compared in terms of tool wear, thrust force and surface roughness during drilling of AISI 304 austenitic stainless steel with HSSE tool. Experimental results show that canolabased cutting ﬂuid gives the best performance due to its higher lubricant properties with respect to other cutting ﬂuids at the constant cutting conditions (spindle speed of $750 rpm$ and feed rate of $0.1 mm/rev$).</p>

				<title>The problem of clear air turbulence: Changing perspectives in the understanding of the phenomenon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0707-0722</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Due to rapid improvements in on-board instrumentation and atmospheric observation systems, in most cases, aircraft are able to steer clear of regions of adverse weather. However, they still encounter unexpected bumpy ﬂight conditions in regions away from storms and clouds. This is the phenomenon of clear air turbulence (CAT), which has been a challenge to our understanding as well as efforts at prediction. While most of such cases result in mild discomfort, a few cases can be violent leading to serious injuries to passengers and damage to the aircraft. The underlying physical mechanisms have been sought to be explained in terms of ﬂuid dynamic instabilities and waves in the atmosphere. The main mechanisms which have been proposed are: (i) Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of shear layers, (ii) waves generated from ﬂow over mountains, (iii) inertia-gravity waves from clouds and other sources, (iv) spontaneous imbalance theory and (v) horizontal vortex tubes. This has also undergone a change over the years. We present an overview of the mechanisms proposed and their implications for prediction.</p>

				<title>Application of digital image correlation method for analysing crack variation of reinforced concrete beams</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0723-0741</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method is a fast-growing emerging technology that provides a low-cost method for measuring the strain of an object. In this study, the feasibility of using this method to observe cracks developed in reinforced concrete beams will be explored so that a practical application can be proposed. The DIC method has been applied for analysing the ﬁeld of surface displacement and strain; it is not applicable for measuring non-continuous ﬁeld of displacement. However, if a singular point (i.e., crack points) can be considered as the area of concentrated strain by imitating the treatment of micro-cracks using the ﬁnite element method, the region of concentrated strain ﬁeld based on analyses of digital images can be applied for determining the locations of cracks. Laboratory results show that cracks developed in reinforced cement beams can be observed with a good precision using the von Mises strain ﬁeld, and that smaller grids lead to clearer crack images. In addition to identifying visible cracks, the DIC image analysis will enable researchers to identify minute cracks that are not visible to naked eyes. Additionally, the DIC method has more accuracy and precision than visual observation for analysing crack loadings so that earlier warnings can be realized before cracks develop in the specimen.</p>

				<title>A comparative study on the use of drilling and milling processes in hole making of GFRP composite</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0743-0760</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Drilling and milling processes are extensively used for producing riveted and bolted joints during the assembly operations of composite laminates with other components. Hole making in glass ﬁbre reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites is the most common mechanical process, which is used to join them to other metallic structures. Bolt joining effectiveness depends, critically, on the quality of the holes. The quality of machined holes in GFRP is strongly dependent on the appropriate choice of the cutting parameters. The main purpose of the present study is to assess the inﬂuence of drilling and milling machining parameters on hole making process of woven laminated GFRP material. A statistical approach is used to understand the effects of the control parameters on the response variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to isolate the effects of the parameters affecting the hole making in the two types of cutting processes. The results showed that milling process is more suitable than drilling process at high level of cutting speed and low level of feed rate, when the cutting quality (minimum surface roughness, minimum difference between upper and lower diameter) is of critical importance in the manufacturing industry, especially for precision assembly operation.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The country is facing energy shortages at present for the connected load. A large population even now does not have access to electricity. As the economy expands and the population increases, the country will need to generate even more power to meet the growing demand. Resources of energy are experiencing constraints to meet the current demand. The generating capacities in the country are underperforming at present because of fuel supply constraint. Analysis in the Energy Policy document hints that conventional fuel resources will begin to exhaust by middle of the century. All these indicate that for India to be able to meet its growing demand, nuclear and solar power could provide energy security in the long term. The first stage of commercially successful nuclear power programme has indicated that country has command on the technology through its own R&amp;D base built since the beginning of establishing Department of Atomic Energy. On this strength it could withstand the technology denial regime for years. The second stage (Fast Breeder Reactor) programme has been initiated. Given the scientific and technological capability demonstrated so far, the technology required for optimizing the second stage programme and launching the third stage programme can be developed to assure long term energy security at the desired capacity.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Nuclear energy as a sustainable resource in India has been very clearly formulated in the three stage nuclear programme. The role of thorium as a potential fuel in the third stage of this programme has also been elucidated. With this aim there have been pioneering research efforts in all aspects of the thorium fuel cycle. Thorium being fertile and not accompanied by the fissile species requires the use of a fissile topping. There have been several studies in India on the use of thorium in different reactor systems from thermal to intermediate and fast spectrum, molten salt reactors, high temperature reactors, compact nuclear power packs and even Subcritical systems. In this paper, we present some of the research studies on use of thorium in thermal reactor systems. We give an overview of the neutronic properties of thorium and the bred fissile material and then proceed to show the performance potential in different reactor systems. We also present the innovative Indian reactor designs which utilize thorium, namely the Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) and the Indian High Temperature Reactors.</p>

				<page>0859-0895</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The area of materials research has registered a phenomenal growth in the recent years, assiduously accepting and assimilating ideas, concepts and analytical as well as experimental methodologies and techniques form almost all scientific disciplines, thereby demonstrating its remarkably multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary character. The focus of the materials programme of this centre is to provide materials, processes and processing solutions to the emerging needs of evolving indigenous nuclear energy systems by proactive research and development on a continuing basis. The initial stage of our activities was formulated around three stage Indian nuclear power programme. In stage I, material issues related to in-core materials with emphasis on development of fabrication routes of zirconium alloys for structural application were addressed. Subsequently the thrust areas were development and characterization of mixed oxide fuel, advanced zirconium alloys, structural steels, superalloys, neutron absorber materials based on boron carbides and borides, and shape memory alloys. The research was useful for in-service performance evaluation, safety assessment, residual life estimation and life extension of nuclear reactors built during stage I i.e., PHWRs and BWRs. It also included developments which would permit rapid expansion of nuclear power initially through fast breeder reactor based on mixed oxide fuel and later based on metallic fuels. For the 3rd stage, multilayer coatings, graphite coolant tube, $BeO$, refractory metals and alloys, heat-treated zirconium alloys are being developed for CHTR, ADSS and AHWR. The materials being developed for fusion programme are low $Z$ and high $Z$ material for plasma facing application, $Cu$-alloys for heat sink, austenitic steels, RAFMS and ODS for structurals and $NbTi$, $Nb_3Sn$ and $Nb_3Al$ superconductors, lithium titanate, lithium silicate breeders, and $Pb–Bi$ coolant. A brief overview of the materials research activities currently being pursued at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre is presented in this article.</p>

				<title>Electronics in nuclear power programme of India$—$An overview</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0897-0924</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>This paper presents an overview of state-of-the art developments in electronics for nuclear power programme of India. Indigenous activities in instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) in the areas of detector development, nuclear instrumentation, monitoring and control electronics and special sensors paved the way to self-reliance in nuclear industry. Notable among the recent I&amp;C systems developed for 540 MWe reactors are Liquid Zone Control System (LZCS), flux mapping system and advance reactor regulating system. In a nuclear plant, apart from ensuring functional requirements, design of electronics needs to meet high level of reliability, safety and security standards. Therefore, a lot of importance is attached to activities such as design review, testing, operation, maintenance and qualifications of I&amp;C systems. Induction of computer based I&amp;C systems mandated a rigorous verification process commensurate with the safety class of the system as specified in Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) safety guides. Software reliability is assured by following strict development life cycle combined with zero-defect policy and is verified through verification and validation (V&amp;V) process. Development of new techniques in data transmissions with optical fibres as transmission medium and wireless networks in control systems is being pursued. With new I&amp;C systems, efforts were made to utilize the same hardware and software platforms for various plant applications, i.e., for standardization. Thrust was given to use Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) in order to improve the reliability of system by reducing component count. It has become imperative to develop modern contemporary solutions like ASICs, HMCs, System on Chip (SOC) and detector mounted electronics and towards that various ASICs and HMCs have been developed in-house to meet the challenges.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Following the Fukushima accident, the safety features of Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) are being re-examined worldwide including India to demonstrate capabilities to cope with severe accidents. In order to restore public confidence and support for nuclear power, it is felt necessary to design future NPPs with near zero impact outside the plant boundary and thus enabling elimination of emergency planning in public domain. Authors have identified a set of safety features which are needed to be incorporated in advanced reactors to achieve this goal. These features enabling prevention, termination, mitigation and containment of radioactivity for beyond design basis accidents arising from extreme natural events are essential for achieving the goal of elimination of emergency planning in public domain. Inherent safety characteristics, passive and engineered safety features to achieve these functions are discussed in this paper. Present trends and future developments in this direction are also described briefly.</p>

				<page></page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Nuclear power is currently the fourth largest source of electricity production in India after thermal, hydro and renewable sources of electricity. Currently, India has 20 nuclear reactors in operation and seven other reactors are under construction. Most of these reactors are indigenously designed and built Heavy Water Reactors. In addition, a 300 MWe Advanced Heavy Water Reactor has already been designed and in the process of deployment in near future for demonstration of power production from Thorium apart from enhanced safety features by passive means. India has ambitious plans to enhance the share of electricity production from nuclear. The recent Fukushima accident has raised concerns of safety of Nuclear Power Plants worldwide. The Fukushima accident was caused by extreme events, i.e., large earthquake followed by gigantic Tsunami which are not expected to hit India’s coast considering the geography of India and historical records. Nevertheless, systematic investigations have been conducted by nuclear scientists in India to evaluate the safety of the current Nuclear Power Plants in case of occurrence of such extreme events in any nuclear site. This paper gives a brief outline of the safety features of Indian Heavy Water Reactors for prevention and mitigation of such extreme events. The probabilistic safety analysis revealed that the risk from Indian Heavy Water Reactors are negligibly small.</p>

				<page>0971-0997</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The overall goal of nuclear power plant safety is to protect individuals, society and the environment from undue radiological hazard so that nuclear power production does not significantly add to the health risks to which individuals and society are already exposed. This paper addresses the safety principles followed during the design phase of life cycle of a nuclear power plant. The principles followed such as safety classification, design rules based on failure modes, detailed stress analysis, stress categorization, consideration of design basis events, failure probability, flaw tolerance, leak-before-break are described. Engineering structures always contain flaws, albeit of very small size. Fatigue and fracture are the two important failure modes affected by flaws. Thus flaw tolerance becomes very important. This is assessed by applying fracture mechanics principles. The R6 procedure, which is used for evaluation of structures containing flaws, has been incorporated in the software BARC-R6. Improvements by way of shell-nozzle junction pull-out, adoption of hot wire GTAW with narrow gap technique have been brought out. Post Fukushima incidence, resistance to seismic loading and containment design have assumed great importance. The paper describes these aspects in detail. Regulatory aspects of seismic design regarding siting, Seismic margin assessment, base isolation, retrofitting are the aspects covered under seismic design. Under the action of seismic loading, the piping in a nuclear power plant piping is vulnerable to a phenomenon called ratcheting. The process of seismic margin assessment and consideration of ratchetting has been backed up by a large experimental data. The experiments carried out on structures and piping components form a part of the paper.</p>

				<title>Integrated safety assessment of Indian nuclear power plants for extreme events: Reducing impact on public mind</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0999-1025</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Nuclear energy professionals need to understand and address the catastrophe syndrome that of late seems to be increasingly at work in public mind in the context of nuclear energy. Classically the nuclear power reactor design and system evolution has been based on the logic of minimization of risk to an acceptable level and its quantification based on a deterministic approach and backed up by a further assessment based on the probabilistic methodology. However, in spite of minimization of risk, the reasons for anxiety and trauma in public mind that still prevails in the context of severe accidents needs to be understood and addressed. Margins between maximum credible accidents factored in the design and the ultimate load withstanding capacities of relevant systems need to be enhanced and guaranteed with a view to minimize release of radioactivity and avoid serious impact in public domain. A more realistic basis for management of an accident in public domain also needs to be quantified for this purpose. Assurance to public on limiting the consequences to a level that does not lead to a trauma is something that we need to be able to credibly demonstrate and confirm. The findings from Chernobyl reports point to significant psychological effects and related health disorders due to large scale emergency relocation of people that could have been possibly reduced by an order of magnitude without significant additional safety detriment. A combination of probabilistic and deterministic approaches should be evolved further to minimize consequences in public domain through enhancing safety margins and adding greater precision to quantitatively predicting accident progression and its management. The paper presents the case studies of the extreme external event such as tsunami and its impact on the coastal nuclear plants in India, the containment integrity assessment under the extreme internal event of over-pressurization and aircraft impact along with hydrogen deflagration/detonation-induced loadings. These are at the moment extremely burning issues due to the severe accidents of Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island reactors. In the present day context identifying the extreme loadings in a separate category and the corresponding margin assessment is necessary in addition to the implementation of the mitigation and upgraded safety measures. Further, the paper attempts to address the question of public trauma in the event of a serious nuclear reactor accident, a need that has been felt in view of the recent Fukushima and earlier Chernobyl accidents and the resulting large scale relocation due to the present deficient policies and the inherent limitations of Linear No Threshold (LNT) principle.</p>

				<page>1027-1050</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) is the national authority for ensuring that the use of ionizing radiation and nuclear energy does not cause any undue risk to the health of workers, members of the public and to the environment. AERB is responsible for the stipulation and enforcement of rules and regulations pertaining to nuclear and radiological safety. This paper describes the regulatory process followed by AERB for ensuring the safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs) during their construction as well as operation. This regulatory process has been continuously evolving to cater to the new developments in reactor technology. Some of the recent initiatives taken by AERB in this direction are briefly described. Today, AERB faces new challenges like simultaneous review of a large number of new projects of diverse designs, a fast growing nuclear power program and functioning of operating plants in a competitive environment. This paper delineates how AERB is gearing up to meet these challenges in an effective manner.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>An experimental study of flow boiling through diverging microchannel has been carried out in this work, with the aim of understanding boiling in nonuniform cross-section microchannel. Diverging microchannel of $4^\circ $ of divergence angle and $146 \mu m$ hydraulic diameter (calculated at mid-length) has been employed for the present study with deionised water as working fluid. Effect of mass flux ($118–1182 kg/m^2$-s) and heat flux ($1.6–19.2 W/cm^2$) on single and two-phase pressure drop and average heat transfer coefficient has been studied. Concurrently, flow visualization is carried out to document the various flow regimes and to correlate the pressure drop and average heat transfer coefficient to the underlying flow regime. Four flow regimes have been identified from the measurements: bubbly, slug, slug–annular and periodic dry-out/ rewetting. Variation of pressure drop with heat flux shows one maxima which corresponds to transition from bubbly to slug flow. It is shown that significantly large heat transfer coefficient (up to $107 kW/m^2$-K) can be attained for such systems, for small pressure drop penalty and with good flow stability.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1083-1126</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Boiling flows are encountered in a wide range of industrial applications such as boilers, core and steam generators in nuclear reactors, petroleum transportation, electronic cooling and various types of chemical reactors. Many of these applications involve boiling flows in conventional channels (channel size $\geq $ 3 mm). The key design issues in two phase flow boiling are variation in flow regimes, occurrence of dry out condition, flow instabilities, and understanding of heat transfer coefficient and vapor quality. This paper briefly reviews published experimental and modeling work in these areas. An attempt is made to provide a perspective and to present available information on boiling in small channels in terms of channel size, flow regimes, heat transfer correlations, pressure drop, critical heat flux and film thickness. An attempt is also made to identify strengths and weaknesses of published approaches and computational models of boiling in small channels. The presented discussion and results will provide an update on the state-of-the-art and will be useful to identify and plan further research in this important area.</p>

The accurate calculation of the interface remains a problem for the volume-of-fluid method if the density ratios of the fluids in different phases are high. The simulations of bubble growth is performed in water at near critical pressure for different degrees of superheat using combined levelset and volume-of fluid (CLSVOF) method. The effect of superheat on the frequency of bubble formation was analyzed. A deviation from the periodic bubble release is observed in the case of superheat of 20 $K$ in water. The vapor-jet-like columnar structure is observed. Effect of heat flux on the slender vapor column has also been explained.</p>

				<title>Mathematical modelling of dropwise condensation on textured surfaces</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1135-1171</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Vapor-to-liquid phase change in the form of discrete drops on or underneath a substrate is called dropwise condensation. The process is hierarchical in the sense that it occurs over a wide range of length and timescales. As the associated heat transfer coefficient is much higher than the film and mixed mode of condensation, it is of considerable interest in applications. The present study is focused on mathematical modelling of dropwise condensation process at multiple scales. The model includes formation of drops at the atomistic scale, droplet growth, coalescence, instability, slide off and fall-off, followed by fresh nucleation of liquid droplets. The model shows that the largest stable cluster size in the atomic model matches the minimum drop radius estimated from thermodynamic considerations. The minimum drop radius is insensitive to surface texturing and does not provide controllability at larger length and timescales. A closer examination of droplet distribution over the substrate reveals that small drops are locations of high heat transfer rates, which diminishes with increasing drop radius. The largest drop diameter depends on its stability and hence, the interfacial forces at phase boundaries. Therefore, drop instability controls the heat transfer coefficient in dropwise condensation. Enhancement of heat transfer necessitates that these drops grow with time, become unstable and be swept away as quickly as possible. Enhancement may be achieved either by (i) inclining the substrate or (ii) by creating an interfacial force at the three-phase contact line by a wettability gradient over the horizontal substrate, inducing drop motion. Wall heat transfer and shear stress under moving drops have been determined using a CFD model. A simple model of coalescence has been adopted in this work. Simulation studies on the effect of fluid properties, surface inclination and its wettability condition on drop size distribution, cycle time, heat transfer coefficient, and wall shear stress are comprehensively discussed in the present article.</p>

				<title>Entrainment phenomenon in gas–liquid two-phase flow: A review</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1173-1217</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The gas–liquid separation equipments are aimed to be designed for maximum efficiency of phase separation. In order to maximize their capacity the flow rates are required to be optimized for the capital cost of equipment. This leads to the situation where the gas phase leaves the separation interface with high velocities and carry liquid phase along with it in the form of droplets reducing the equipment efficiency. This is known as entrainment or carryover. Depending on the nature of the separation interface i.e., turbulence intensity, bubble dynamics, the size and velocity distribution of liquid fragments, droplets at the separation interface varies. This is the main source of empiricism involved in the analysis of such equipments. The mechanics of motion of the dispersed liquid phase in bulk of gas is relatively well studied. In the present paper the various experimental, analytical and numerical investigations carried out to address the issues of entrainment/carryover are carefully analyzed. Further, a critical review has been presented for bringing out a coherent theme and a current status of the subject under reference.</p>

These condensers in fact are usually operated at very low pressures, making it difficult to experimentally acquire quantitative knowledge of all the variables involved. Mathematical modelling and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations are used here to achieve a better comprehension of the flow dynamics and of the process of ice condensation and deposition in the condenser, in order to evaluate condenser efficiency and gain deeper insights of the process to be used for the improvement of its design. Both a complete laboratory-scale freeze-drying apparatus and an industrial-scale condenser have been investigated in this work, modelling the process of water vapour deposition. Different operating conditions have been considered and the influence exerted by the inert gas as well as other parameters has been investigated.</p>

				<title>Numerical analysis of grid plate melting after a severe accident in a Fast-Breeder Reactor (FBR)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1241-1257</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Fast breeder reactors (FBRs) are provided with redundant and diverse plant protection systems with a very low failure probability (&lt;$10^{−6}$/reactor year), making core disruptive accident (CDA), a beyond design basis event (BDBE). Nevertheless, safety analysis is carried out even for such events with a view to mitigate their consequences by providing engineered safeguards like the in-vessel core catcher. During a CDA, a significant fraction of the hot molten fuel moves downwards and gets relocated to the lower plate of grid plate. The ability of this plate to resist or delay relocation of core melt further has been investigated by developing appropriate mathematical models and translating them into a computer code HEATRAN-1. The core melt is a time dependent volumetric heat source because of the radioactive decay of the fission products which it contains. The code solves the nonlinear heat conduction equation including phase change. The analysis reveals that if the bottom of grid plate is considered to be adiabatic, melt-through of grid plate (i.e., melting of the entire thickness of the plate) occurs between 800 s and 1000 s depending upon the initial conditions. Knowledge of this time estimate is essential for defining the initial thermal load on the core catcher plate. If heat transfer from the bottom of grid plate to the underlying sodium is taken into account, then melt-through does not take place, but the temperature of grid plate is high enough to cause creep failure.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1259-1285</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Enthalpy method is commonly used in the simulation of melting and solidification owing to its ease of implementation. It however has a few shortcomings. When it is used to simulate melting/solidification on a coarse grid, the temperature time history of a point close to the interface shows waviness. While simulatingmelting with natural convection, in order to impose no-slip and impermeability boundary conditions, momentum sink terms are used with some arbitrary constants called mushy zone constants. The values of these are very large and have no physical basis. Further, the chosen values affect the predictions and hence have to be tuned for satisfactory comparison with experimental data. To overcome these deficiencies, a new cell splitting method under the framework of the enthalpy method has been proposed. This method does not produce waviness nor requires mushy zone constants for simulating melting with natural convection. The method is then demonstrated for a simple onedimensional melting problem and the results are compared with analytical solutions. The method is then demonstrated to work in two-dimensions and comparisons are shown with analytical solutions for problems with planar and curvilinear interfaces. To further benchmark the present method, simulations are performed for melting in a rectangular cavity with natural convection in the liquid melt. The solid–liquid interface obtained is compared satisfactorily with the experimental results available in literature.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Crystallization is extensively used in different industrial applications, including the production of a wide range of materials such as fertilizers, detergents, food and pharmaceutical products, as well as in the mineral processing industries and treatment of waste effluents. In spite of the wide-spread use of crystallization, a clear understanding of the thermodynamic, kinetic and hydrodynamic aspects of the design methodologies are not yet well established. More often than not crystallization is still considered an art especially in fine-chemicals, pharmaceuticals and life-sciences sector. It is essential to understand and relate key thermodynamic, kinetic and hydrodynamic aspects to crystallizer performance, not just in terms of yield but also in terms of product quality (characterized by particle size distribution, morphology, polymorphism and the amount of strain as well as the uptake of solvent or impurities in the crystal lattice). This paper attempts to do that by critically reviewing published experimental and modelling studies on establishing and enhancing state-of-the-art thermodynamic, kinetic and hydrodynamic aspects of crystallization. Efforts are made to discuss and raise points for emerging modelling tools needed for a flexible design and operation of crystallizers and crystallization processes that are needed to meet the ever increasing demand on precise product specifications. Focus is on bringing out the trends which can be used as perspectives for future studies in this field.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Heat dissipation enhancement of LED luminaries is of great significance to the large-scale application of LED. Luminaries-level structure improvement by the method of boring through-hole is adopted to intensify heat dissipation. Furthermore, the natural convection heat transfer process of LED luminaries is simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model before and after the structural modification. As shown by computational results, boring through-hole is beneficial to develop bottomto-top natural convection, eliminate local circumfluence, and finally form better flow pattern. Analysis based on field synergy principle shows that boring through-hole across LED luminaries improves the synergy between flow field and temperature field, and effectively decreases the thermal resistance of luminaries-level heat dissipation structure. Under the same computational conditions, by luminaries-level structure improvement the highest temperature of heat sink is decreased by about $8^\circ C$ and the average heat transfer coefficient is increased by 45.8%.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Submerged arc welding (SAW) is a fusion joining process, known for its high deposition capabilities. This process is useful in joining thick section components used in various industries. Besides joining, SAW can also be used for surfacing applications. Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) produced within the base metal as a result of tremendous heat of arc is of big concern as it affects the performance of welded$/$surfaced structure in service due to metallurgical changes in the affected region. This work was carried out to investigate the effect of polarity and other SAW parameters on HAZ size and dilution and to establish their correlations. Influence of heat input on dilution and heat affected zone was then carried out. Four levels of heat input were used to study their effect on % dilution and HAZ area at both the electrode positive and electrode negative polarities. Proper management of heat input in welding is important, because power sources can be used more efficiently if one knows how the same heat input can be applied to get the better results. Empirical models have been developed using statistical technique.</p>

				<title>A temperature dependent slip factor based thermal model for friction stir welding of stainless steel</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1393-1405</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>This paper proposes a new slip factor based three-dimensional thermal model to predict the temperature distribution during friction stir welding of 304L stainless steel plates. The proposed model employs temperature and radius dependent heat source to study the thermal cycle, temperature distribution, power required, the effect of process parameters on heat generation per mm length of the weld and peak temperature during the friction stir welding process. Simulations of friction stir welding process were carried out on 304L stainless steel workpieces for various rotational and welding speeds. The predicted thermal cycle, power required and temperature distributions were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The heat generation per mm length of weld and peak temperature were found to be directly proportional to rotational speed and inversely proportional to welding speed. The rate of increase in heat generation per mm length of the weld and peak temperature are found to be higher at lower rotational speeds and lower at higher rotational speed. The heat generation during friction stir welding was found to be 80.8 % at shoulder, 16.1 % at pin side and 3.1 % at the bottom of the pin.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1407-1419</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Friction welding is widely used as a mass production method in various industries. In the present study, an experimental set-up was designed in order to achieve friction welding of plastically deformed AISI 1021 steels. In this study, low alloy steel (AISI 1021) was welded under different welding parameters and afterwards the mechanical properties such as tensile strength, impact strength and hardness were experimentally determined. On the basis of the results obtained from the experimentation, the graphs were plotted. It is the strength of welded joints, which is fundamental property to the service reliability of the weldments and hence present work was undertaken to study the influence of axial pressure and rotational speed in friction welded joints. Axial pressure and rotational speed are the two major parameters which can influence the strength and hence the mechanical properties of the friction welded joints. Thus the axial pressure and rotational speed were taken as welding parameters, which reflect the mechanical properties.</p>

				<title>Influence of curing regimes on compressive strength of ultra high performance concrete</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1421-1431</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The present paper is aimed to identify an efficient curing regime for ultra high performance concrete (UHPC), to achieve a target compressive strength more than 150 MPa, using indigenous materials. The thermal regime plays a vital role due to the limited fineness of ingredients and low water/binder ratio. By activation of the reaction kinetics, the effectiveness of the binder is enhanced which leads to improvements in mechanical as well as durability properties. The curing cycle employed are ambient air curing, water curing and hot air curing. The specimens were exposed to thermal regime at ($90^\circ C/150^\circ C/200^\circ C$) for duration of 24, 48 or 72 hours at the age of 3rd and 7th day followed with air curing or water curing till 28 days. The results showed a marked difference in compressive strength ranging from 217 to 142 MPa with change in curing regimes. The samples when thermally cured at the age of 3rd and 7th day produced an average ultimate strength of 217–152 MPa and 196–150 MPa, respectively.</p>

				<title>Role of friction stir processing parameters on microstructure and microhardness of boron carbide particulate reinforced copper surface composites</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1433-1450</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Friction stir processing (FSP) was applied to fabricate boron carbide ($B_4C$) particulate reinforced copper surface composites. The effect of FSP parameters such as tool rotational speed, processing speed and groove width on microstructure and microhardness was investigated. A groove was contrived on the 6mm thick copper plates and packed with $B_4C$ particles. FSP was carried out using five various tool rotational speeds, processing speeds and groove widths. Optical and scanning electron microscopies were employed to study the microstructure of the fabricated surface composites. The results indicated that the selected FSP parameters significantly influenced the area of surface composite, distribution of $B_4C$ particles and microhardness of the surface composites. Higher tool rotational speed and lower processing speed produced an excellent distribution of $B_4C$ particles and higher area of surface composite due to higher frictional heat, increased stirring and material tranportation. The $B_4C$ particles were bonded well to the copper matrix and refined the grains of copper due to the pinning effect of $B_4C$ particles. $B_4C$ particles retained the original size and morphology because of its small size and minimum sharp corners in the morphology.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>In this study, it was aimed to map the corrected Standard Penetration Test(SPT) values in Karşıyaka city center by kriging approach. Six maps were prepared by this geostatistical approach at depths of 3, 6, 9, 13.5, 18 and 25.5m. Borehole test results obtained from 388 boreholes in central Karşıyaka were used to model the spatial variation of $(N_1)_{60cs}$ values in an area of 5.5 km${}^2$. Corrections were made for depth, hammer energy, rod length, sampler, borehole diameter and fines content, to the data in hand. At various depths, prepared variograms and the kriging method were used together to model the variation of corrected SPT data in the region, which enabled the estimation of missing data in the region. The results revealed that the estimation ability of the models were acceptable, which were validated by a number of parameters as well as the comparisons of the actual and estimated data. Outcomes of this study can be used in microzonation studies, site response analyses, calculation of bearing capacity of subsoils in the region and producing a number of parameters which are empirically related to corrected SPT number as well.</p>

				<title>Dual watermarking technique with multiple biometric watermarks</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to improve the robustness of the watermarking algorithm, a dual watermarking method is proposed to prove copyright ownership. Visible watermarking is important for protecting online resources from unauthorized reproduction. However robust, visible watermarks are vulnerable to illegal removal and other common signal processing and geometric attacks. Multiple invisible watermarks can enhance the protection of the visibly watermarked image. When the ownership of tampered image is in question, the invisible watermark can be extracted to provide appropriate ownership information. We have proposed dual watermarking scheme with multiple biometric watermarks in which it embeds speech and face biometric traits of owner invisibly and lastly offline signature is overlaid translucently on image. Before embedding, speech is compressed using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Gabor face is created from face biometric trait. All three watermarks Gabor face, LPC coefficients and offline signature are the biometric characteristics of the owner and hence they are highly related with copyright holder. The proposed scheme is robust enough, Gabor face and LPC coefficients can be extracted from the signature marked image or even from the tampered image from which signature is removed illegally or legally. As multiple watermarks are embedded at least one watermark survives under different attacks. It can find application for joint ownership or to address single ownership multiple times.</p>

				<title>Providing an efficient intelligent transportation system through detection, tracking and recognition of the region of interest in traffic signs by using non-linear SVM classifier in line with histogram oriented gradient and Kalman filter approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0037</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With a focus on new researches in the area of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), an efficient approach has been investigated here. Based on the present view point, analysis of traffic signs are first considered via intelligence based approach, which is carried out through three main stages including detection, tracking and recognition, respectively, in this research. The key role of detection is to identify traffic signs by classification of road sign shapes in accordance with their signatures. This classification consists of four different shapes of circle, semicircle, triangle and square, as well. The linear classification of traffic sign is also carried out via support vector machine (SVM) by using one against all (OAA), since the present SVMs classifiers realized via linear kernel. The next step is to track traffic sign. It should be noted that this technique is now developed to reduce the searching mode in case of the whole area to be optimized its computational processing, consequently. This research work is investigated by realizing Kalman filter approach, where, finally, in recognition step, a feature of the region of interest (ROI) has been extracted for SVM classification. Histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) is realized in organizing the approach, as long as Gaussian kernel is also developed for non-linear SVM classifier.</p>

				<title>Gain ratio based fuzzy weighted association rule mining classifier for medical diagnostic interface</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0039-0052</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The health care environment still needs knowledge based discovery for handling wealth of data. Extraction of the potential causes of the diseases is the most important factor for medical data mining. Fuzzy association rule mining is wellperformed better than traditional classifiers but it suffers from the exponential growth of the rules produced. In the past, we have proposed an information gain based fuzzy association rule mining algorithm for extracting both association rules and membership functions of medical data to reduce the rules. It used a ranking based weight value to identify the potential attribute. When we take a large number of distinct values, the computation of information gain value is not feasible. In this paper, an enhanced approach, called gain ratio based fuzzy weighted association rule mining, is thus proposed for distinct diseases and also increase the learning time of the previous one. Experimental results show that there is a marginal improvement in the attribute selection process and also improvement in the classifier accuracy. The system has been implemented in Java platform and verified by using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository.</p>

				<title>Mining knowledge from text repositories using information extraction: A review</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0053-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There are two approaches to mining text form online repositories. First, when the knowledge to be discovered is expressed directly in the documents to be mined, Information Extraction (IE) alone can serve as an effective tool for such text mining. Second, when the documents contain concrete data in unstructured form rather than abstract knowledge, Information Extraction (IE) can be used to first transform the unstructured data in the document corpus into a structured database, and then use some state-of-the-art data mining algorithms/tools to identify abstract patterns in this extracted data. This paper presents the review of several methods related to these two approaches.</p>

				<title>A string matching based algorithm for performance evaluation of mathematical expression recognition</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0063-0079</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we have addressed the problem of automated performance evaluation of Mathematical Expression (ME) recognition. Automated evaluation requires that recognition output and ground truth in some editable format like ${\rm\LaTeX}$, MathML, etc. have to be matched. But standard forms can have extraneous symbols or tags. For example, $&lt;$mo$&gt;$ tag is added for an operator in MathML and \begin$\{$array$\}$ is used to encoded matrices in ${\rm\LaTeX}$. These extraneous symbols are also involved in matching that is not intuitive. For that, we have proposed a novel structure encoded string representation that is independent of any editable format. Structure encoded strings retain the structure (spatial relationships like superscript, subscript, etc.) and do not contain any extraneous symbols. As structure encoded strings give the linear representation of MEs, Levenshtein edit distance is used as a measure for performance evaluation. Therefore, in our approach, recognition output and ground truth in ${\rm\LaTeX}$ form are converted to their corresponding structure encoded strings and Levenshtein edit distance is computed between them.</p>

				<page>0081-0095</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we propose biogeography based optimization technique, with linear and sinusoidal migration models and simplified biogeography based optimization (S-BBO), for uniformly spaced linear antenna array synthesis to maximize the reduction of side lobe level (SLL). This paper explores biogeography theory. It generalizes two migration models in BBO namely, linear migration model and sinusoidal migration model. The performance of SLL reduction in ULA is investigated. Our performance study shows that among the two, sinusoidal migration model is a promising candidate for optimization. In our work, simplified – BBO algorithmis also deployed. This determines an optimum set value for amplitude excitations of antenna array elements that generate a radiation pattern with maximum side lobe level reduction. Our detailed investigation also shows that sinusoidal migration model of BBO performs better compared to the other evolutionary algorithms discussed in this paper.</p>

				<title>Automatic Tamil lyric generation based on ontological interpretation for semantics</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0121</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This system proposes an $N$-gram based approach to automatic Tamil lyric generation, by the ontological semantic interpretation of the input scene. The approach is based on identifying the semantics conveyed in the scenario, thereby making the system understand the situation and generate lyrics accordingly. The heart of the system includes the ontological interpretation of the scenario, and the selection of the appropriate tri-grams for generating the lyrics. To fulfill this, we have designed a new ontology with weighted edges, where the edges correspond to a set of sentences, which indicate a relationship, and are represented as a tri-gram. Once the appropriate tri-grams are selected, the root words from these tri-grams are sent to the morphological generator, to form words in their packed form. These words are then assembled to form the final lyrics. Parameters of poetry like rhyme, alliteration, simile, vocative words, etc., are also taken care of by the system. Using this approach, we achieved an average accuracy of 77.3% with respect to the exact semantic details being conveyed in the generated lyrics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Semi-automatic control systems have the characteristics of being adaptable and requiring low energy. The objective of this research was to study the performance of an improved DSHD (Displacement Semi-Active Hydraulic Damper) by converting it to AIC (Active Interaction Control Device) with the addition of an accumulator. The prototype was tested using full-scale elements for examining the structural displacement, and typical responses of the interacting interface element developed in this research, the pressure variation of the pressure storage device, and the energy dissipation hysteresis loop when the structure installed with these elements is subjected to external force of various magnitude. The laboratory results confirm that the device developed in this research is capable of applying the energy dissipation characteristics of DSHD so that these elements are appropriate for developing the proposed AIC. The mutual interaction between the subordinate structure and the main structure to be protected is capable of transforming the quake energy applied to the main structure to the subordinate structure so that the objective of minimizing the deformation of main structural can be achieved.</p>

				<title>A reexamination of some puzzling results in linearized elasticity</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0139-0147</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we analyse three commonly discussed ‘flaws’ of linearized elasticity theory and attempt to resolve them. The first ‘flaw’ concerns cylindrically orthotropic material models. Since the work of Lekhnitskii (1968), there has been a growing body of work that continues to this day, that shows that infinite stresses arise with the use of a cylindrically orthotropicmaterial model even in the case of linearized elasticity. Besides infinite stresses, interpenetration of matter is also shown to occur. These infinite stresses and interpenetration occur when the ratio of the circumferential Young modulus to the radial Young modulus is less than one. If the ratio is greater than one, then the stresses at the center of a spinning disk are found to be zero (recall that for an isotropic material model, the stresses are maximum at the center). Thus, the stresses go abruptly from a maximum value to a value of zero as the ratio is increased to a value even slightly above one! One of the explanations provided for this extremely anomalous behaviour is the failure of linearized elasticity to satisfy material frameindifference. However, if this is the true cause, then the anomalous behaviour should also occur with the use of an isotropic material model, where, no such anomalies are observed.We show that the real cause of the problem is elsewhere and also show how these anomalies can be resolved. We also discuss how the formulation of linearized elastodynamics in the case of small deformations superposed on a rigid motion can be given in a succinct manner. Finally, we show how the long-standing problem of devising three compatibility relations instead of six can be resolved.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0149-0164</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper deals with the development and application of a kinetic theory-based mesh-free method for unsteady flows. The method has the capability to compute on any arbitrary distribution of moving nodes. In general, computation of unsteady flow past multiple moving boundaries using conventional finite volume solvers are quite involved. They invariably require repeated grid generation or an efficient grid movement strategy. This approach becomes more difficult when there are many moving boundaries. In the present work, we propose a simple and an effective node movement strategy for the mesh-free solver. This can tackle the unsteady problems with moving boundaries in a much easier way. Using the present method we have computed unsteady flow in oscillating turbomachinery blades. A simple energy method has been used to predict flutter using the unsteady computations. The results compare well with the available experiments and other computations.</p>

					<p>Several authors have proposed different methods for solving fuzzy minimum cost flow (MCF) problems. In this paper, some single and multi-objective fuzzy MCF problems are chosen which cannot be solved by using any of the existing methods and a new method is proposed for solving such type of problems. The main advantage of the proposed method over existing methods is that the fuzzy MCF problems which can be solved by using the existing methods can also be solved by the proposed method. But, there exist several fuzzy MCF problems which can be solved only by using the proposed method i.e., it is not possible to solve these problems by using the existing methods. To illustrate the proposed method and also to show the advantages of the proposed method over existing methods some single and multiobjective fuzzy MCF problems which cannot be solved by using the existing methods are solved by using the proposed method and the obtained results are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a numerical model using three-dimensional finite difference code FLAC3D is proposed for analysing the stability of an oil well drilled in four formations. Normalized Yielded Zone Area (NYZA, i.e., the ratio of surrounding yielded cross-sectional area to initial area of well) has been determined for different mud pressures. In each formation, by interpolating of obtained NYZA equal to one, the optimized mud pressure was determined using MATLAB software. Practical data including geomechanical parameters along with drilling data from one of Iranian oilfields, Mansouri-54 well have been utilized in this analysis. $In situ$ stress was determined using stress polygon method and conducting hydraulic fracturing data in the field. Analytical solution using the Mogi–Coulomb and the Hoek–Brown failure criteria has been carried out and results are compared with the presented model. The results demonstrated that the NYZA and Hoek–Brown criteria might underestimate and overestimate the drilling mud pressure, respectively, and should be used cautiously. In the inclined section of the well, plastic zone showed more extension in the lower part than upper part of the well because of the high stress concentration.</p>

				<title>Effect of geological medium on seismic signals from underground nuclear explosion events – A case study for Baneberry site</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0221-0266</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seismic signals due to any underground nuclear explosion events are known to be influenced by the local geology of the test site and the yield level. In this paper, transient three-dimensional finite element code SHOCK-3D developed for the simulation of underground nuclear explosion events has been used to obtain synthetic acceleration signals for Baneberry site (Nevada) single and composite rock media. At this site an underground nuclear test of 10 kT conducted on 18th December 1970 at source depth of 278 m resulted into venting as reported by Terhune $et al$ with 2D simulation results and later by us through 3D simulation in Ranjan $et al$. First, the reasons of the venting for this event are summarized. After the successful validation of the 3D numerical model for Baneberry site rock media, parametric studies are carried out for 1 and 8 kT yields at 100 m depth (Scaled Depths of Burst SDOB $\sim$ 100 and 50 m$/$kT$^{1/3}$, respectively) for homogeneous and composite Paleozoic and Tuff media of Baneberry site. It is demonstrated that the near source local geological formations and associated nonlinear effects significantly influence the seismic signals. With this study the seismic decoupling of the source by an order of magnitude has been illustrated. Finally, it is concluded that the seismic signals alone, in the absence of in-depth information of the local geology of the specific test site, are not appropriate measures of the source strength.</p>

				<title>A new colour constancy algorithm based on automatic determination of gray framework parameters using neural network</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0267-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Colour constancy is defined as the ability to estimate the actual colours of objects in an acquired image disregarding the colour of scene illuminant. Despite large variety of existing methods, no colour constancy algorithm can be considered as universal. Among the methods, the gray framework is one of the best-known and most used approaches. This framework has some parameters that should be set with appropriate values to achieve the best performance for each image. In this article, we propose a neural network-based algorithm that aims to automatically determine the best value of gray framework parameters for each image. It is a multi-level approach that estimates the optimal values for the gray framework parameters based on relevant features extracted from the input image. Experimental results on two popular colour constancy datasets show an acceptable improvement over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we propose a new pattern classification system by combining Temporal features with Fuzzy Min–Max (TFMM) neural network based classifier for effective decision support in medical diagnosis. Moreover, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm based rule extractor is also proposed in this work for improving the detection accuracy. Intelligent fuzzy rules are extracted from the temporal features with Fuzzy Min–Max neural network based classifier, and then PSO rule extractor is used to minimize the number of features in the extracted rules. We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed TFMM-PSO system using the UCI Machine Learning Repository Data Set. The results are analysed and compared with other published results. In addition, the detection accuracy is validated by using the ten-fold cross validation.</p>

				<title>Occlusion invariant face recognition using mean based weight matrix and support vector machine</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0303-0315</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a novel occlusion invariant face recognition algorithm based on Mean based weight matrix (MBWM) technique is proposed. The proposed algorithm is composed of two phases$—$the occlusion detection phase and the MBWM based face recognition phase. A feature based approach is used to effectively detect partial occlusions for a given input face image. The input face image is first divided into a finite number of disjointed local patches, and features are extracted for each patch, and the occlusion present is detected. Features obtained from the corresponding occlusion-free patches of training images are used for face image recognition. The SVM classifier is used for occlusion detection for each patch. In the recognition phase, the MBWM bases of occlusion-free image patches are used for face recognition. Euclidean nearest neighbour rule is applied for the matching. GTAV face database that includes many occluded face images by sunglasses and hand are used for the experiment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed local patchbased occlusion detection technique works well and theMBWM based method shows superior performance to other conventional approaches.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Image registration using template matching is an important step in image processing. In this paper, a simple, robust and computationally efficient approach is presented. The proposed approach is based on the properties of a normalized covariance matrix. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that the image matching can be achieved without calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a covariance matrix, hence reduces the computational complexity. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs better in the presence of various noises and rigid geometric transformations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Multimedia information retrieval systems continue to be an active research area in the world of huge and voluminous data. The paramount challenge is to translate or convert a visual query from a human and find similar images or videos in large digital collection. In this paper, a technique of region based image retrieval, a branch of Content Based Image Retrieval, is proposed. The proposed model does not need prior knowledge or full semantic understanding of image content. It identifies significant regions in an image based on feature-based attention model which mimic viewer’s attention. The Curvelet Transform in combination with colour descriptors are used to represent each significant region in an image. Experimental results are analysed and compared with the state-of-the-art Region Based Image Retrieval Technique.</p>

				<title>Fractional M-band dual tree complex wavelet transform for digital watermarking</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0345-0361</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a novel digital watermarking scheme using fractional M-band dual tree complex wavelet transform (Fr-M-band-DT-CWT) is proposed. High frequency channels have wide bandwidth and low frequency channels have narrow bandwidth. These characteristics are suitable for analysing low frequency signal, but not for relatively high frequency signal. The images often contain many edges, which may cause rich middle and high frequency components in the 2-band wavelet domain. Therefore, the ordinary 2-band dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) is not well-suited for analysing the image. So, the M-band DT-CWT with the FrFT called Fr-M-band-DT-CWT is proposed in this paper to address this problem. Further, we integrate the Fr-M-band-DT-CWT with singular value decomposition (SVD) in order to enhance the performance. Experimental results of the proposed watermarking scheme are compared with the previously available watermarking algorithms, fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), fractional wavelet transform (FrWT). Further, the proposed watermark extraction scheme is also tested on different attacks. The results of the present investigations show that the proposed watermarking scheme is superior as compared to other existing watermarking schemes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper proposes an optimization procedure based on eigenvalues to carry out the stabilization function of the Gate-Controlled Series Capacitor (GCSC) in a power system. It is aimed to provide a reliable damping framework by means of a GCSC based multi-objective damping controller. The proposed method employs Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to search for optimal parameter settings of a widely used multi-objective lead-lag damping controller. The eigenvalue analysis is considered as the cornerstone of the performed studies in order to investigate the multi-objective methodology in which the unstable or lightly damped modes are scheduled to effectively shift to some prescribed stability zones in the s-plane. The effectiveness of the suggested approach in damping local and interarea oscillations modes in a multi-machine power system, over a wide range of loading conditions, is confirmed through eigenvalue analysis and time simulation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Deregulation of the electricity industry aims for creating a competitive market to trade electricity, which generates a host of new technical challenges among market participants and power system researchers. One of the major challenges is to establish a cost for system services on a nondiscriminatory basis. In this paper, the evaluation of transmission cost is proposed based on sensitivity factor method like AC Power Transfer Distribution Factor (ACPTDF) method for bilateral and multilateral transactions. The transacted power is estimated by ACPTDF method for each transaction. The advantages of the proposed methodology are demonstrated on a sample 6 bus, IEEE 30 bus and Indian Utility 69 bus systems. The solution provides a better pricing approach that can impact a more reasonable economic indicator for transmission cost.</p>

				<page>0391-0407</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Multi-machine, single-inverter induction motor drives are attractive in situations in which all machines are of similar ratings, and operate at approximately the same load torques. The advantages include small size compared to multi-inverter system, lower weight and overall cost. However, field oriented control of such drives is a challenge since no two motors will have exactly the same operating conditions at any time. In general, at least some motors in the system will operate away from perfect field orientation. It is therefore important to analyse their torque dynamics carefully. This paper discusses existing multi-machine field-oriented control methods, and analyses and compares them from the viewpoint of dynamic performance. For this, an analytical framework based on small-signal analysis is developed to compare multi-machine control methods. This analysis is verified by simulations and experiments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electrical domain equalization of chromatic and polarization mode dispersion is attractive in coherent optical communication links. Digital coherent receivers used for this purpose are based on high speed ADCs followed by DSP, which dissipate excessive amount of power and are very costly to implement. We propose analog coherent receiver to drastically reduce the power consumption, size and cost. An adaptive feed forward equalizer for 40 Gbps dual polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) systems, which processes signals in analog domain itself, is demonstrated using circuit and system simulations. The equalizer, designed in 90 nm CMOS technology, consumes 450 mW of power and occupies 1.8 mm $\times$ 1.1 mm chip area. System simulations are used to show that blind equalization is also possible when this approach is used in decision directed mode.</p>

				<title>Efficiency of wave impeding barrier in pipeline construction under earthquake excitation using nonlinear finite element analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0419-0436</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Earthquakes have caused colossal casualties and severe damages to engineering structures and especially leading to substantial economic loss to the underground structures and/or infrastructures. Pipelines are one of most important component of lifeline engineering. For instance, the Southern Caucasus- Eastern Turkey energy corridors are formed by several key pipelines carrying crude oil and natural gas from Azerbaijan, via Georgia, to world markets through Mediterranean Sea. Many project accomplished recently and construction of new corridors are still going on. They should be protected from earthquake disaster especially when they pass through high seismicity zones. The installation of wave impeding barriers (WIB) below the vulnerable infrastructures as pipelines established in soft soil can be used to reduce the effect of the earthquake induced ground borne vibrations. In this paper, a WIB as artificial bedrock based on the cut-off frequency of a soil layer over bedrock is proposed as isolation measurement in order to mitigate the dynamic response of the buried pipelines under earthquake strong ground motion. The computational simulation of the wave propagation problem is directly achieved by employing nonlinear 2D finite element modelling for prediction of screening performance of WIB on the dynamic response of vibrating coupled soil-pipeline system. Energy absorbing boundaries along the truncated interfaces of the unbounded nature of the underlying soil media are implemented in the time domain along with Newmark’s integration. An extensive parametric investigation and systematic computations are performed with different controlling parameters. The obtained numerical results point out that WIB can be very promising as an isolator to protect pipelines when they establish for a certain depth.</p>

					<p>Low and mid-rise reinforced concrete (RC) buildings consist of an important portion of the building stock in many earthquake prone countries. Therefore understanding their seismic behaviour is important for mitigation studies. This study aims to evaluate how much and when; seismic code, number of stories, concrete strength, amount of transverse reinforcement and infill-wall contribution parameters are important for seismic performances of RC buildings. Seismic performances of the models reflecting different cases are determined for different performance levels and seismic loading conditions. Based on the considered values of the parameters, it is concluded that: modern code specifications and higher transverse reinforcement 50%, the concrete strength up to 66%, infill-walls 15% and number of story 55% increase the seismic performance for life safety level. Evaluations on the effect of the considered parameters for different performance levels and seismic loadings in relation with other parameters are also given in this paper.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The parameters associated to a environmental dispersion model may include different kinds of variability, imprecision and uncertainty. More often, it is seen that available information is interpreted in probabilistic sense. Probability theory is a well-established theory to measure such kind of variability. However, not all available information, data or model parameters affected by variability, imprecision and uncertainty, can be handled by traditional probability theory. Uncertainty or imprecision may occur due to incomplete information or data, measurement error or data obtained from expert judgement or subjective interpretation of available data or information. Thus for model parameters, data may be affected by subjective uncertainty. Traditional probability theory is inappropriate to represent subjective uncertainty. Possibility theory is used as a tool to describe parameters with insufficient knowledge. Based on the polynomial chaos expansion, stochastic response surface method has been utilized in this article for the uncertainty propagation of atmospheric dispersion model under consideration of both probabilistic and possibility information. The proposed method has been demonstrated through a hypothetical case study of atmospheric dispersion.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, method of temporal moments has been used to analyse the transport characteristics of reactive solute along fracture in a coupled fracture-skin-matrix system. In order to obtain the concentration distribution within the fracture, a system of coupled partial differential equations for fracture, fractureskin and rock-matrix has been solved numerically in a pseudo two-dimensional domain using implicit finite difference method. Subsequently, lower order temporal moments of solute have been computed from the concentration distribution to analyse the transport characteristics of solutes in the fracture. This study has been done by considering an inlet boundary condition of constant continuous source in a single fracture. The effect of various fracture-skin parameters like porosity, thickness and diffusion coefficient on the transport of solutes have been studied by doing sensitivity analyses. The effect of nonlinear sorption and radioactive decay of solutes have also been analysed by carrying out simulations for different sorption intensities and decay constants. Numerical results suggested that the presence of fracture-skin significantly influences the transport characteristics of reactive solutes along the fracture.</p>

				<page>0511-0524</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Corrosion is a long-term, inevitable process, lessens the thickness and load carrying capacity of structures. Old steel structures are more vulnerable to buckling, yielding and fracture due to corrosion. In lieu of a detailed analysis, average thickness assumption is employed for general type of corrosion. However, the estimation of load carrying capacity reduction of corroded structures typically need a much higher level of accuracy, since the actual corroded plates would have irregular surfaces. The objective of this article is to determine the effect of general corrosion on reduction of elastic buckling strength of both-sided partially corroded plates with irregular surfaces. Eigenvalue analysis using finite element method is employed for Euler stress calculation of corroded plates. The effects of different influential parameters are investigated and it is found that, aspect ratio of plate, location of corroded area, standard deviation of thickness diminution and concentration of corrosion have influence on reduction of elastic buckling strength. Reduction of elastic buckling strength is very sensitive to the amount of corrosion loss. The higher the amount of corrosion loss, the more reduction of elastic buckling strength.</p>

Fracture area and stretch zones were analysed by SEM. Stable crack growth was monitored by videoextensometry techniques on CT (Compact Tension) specimens. Specimens were loaded under two loading rates by eccentric tension, whereby the deformation in the notch surrounding area was recorded using a non-contact measurement–videoextensometry technique.

					<p>This paper presents a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique to train an artificial neural network (ANN) for prediction of flank wear in drilling, and compares the network performance with that of the back propagation neural network (BPNN). This analysis is carried out following a series of experiments employing high speed steel (HSS) drills for drilling on mild steel workpieces, under different sets of cutting conditions and noting the root mean square (RMS) value of spindle motor current as well as the average flank wear in each case. The results show that the PSO trained ANN not only gives better prediction results and reduced computational times compared to the BPNN, it is also a more robust model, being free of getting trapped in local optimum solutions unlike the latter. Besides, it offers the advantages of a straight-forward logic, simple realization and underlying intelligence.</p>

				<title>Study of liquid fuel transport in a small carburetted engine in the context of cold-start HC emission control</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0549-0571</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, a detailed visualization of the transport of fuel film has been performed in a small carburetted engine with a transparent manifold at the exit of the carburettor. The presence of fuel film is observed significantly on the lower half of the manifold at idling, while at load conditions, the film is found to be distributed all throughout the manifold walls. Quantitative measurement of the fuel film in a specially-designed manifold of square cross section has also been performed using the planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique. The measured fuel film thickness is observed to be of the order of 1 mm at idling, and in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 mm over the range of load and speed studied. These engine studies are complemented by experiments conducted in a carburettor rig to study the state of the fuel exiting the carburettor. Laser-based Particle/Droplet Image Analysis (PDIA) technique is used to identify fuel droplets and ligaments and estimate droplet diameters. At a throttle position corresponding to idling, the fuel exiting the carburettor is found to consist of very fine droplets of size less than 15 $\mu$m and large fuel ligaments associated with length scales of the order of 500 $\mu$m and higher. For a constant pressure difference across the carburettor, the fuel consists of droplets with an SMD of the order of 30 $\mu$m. Also, the effect of liquid fuel film on the cold start HC emissions is studied. Based on the understanding obtained from these studies, strategies such as manifold heating and varying carburettor main jet nozzle diameter are implemented. These are observed to reduce emissions under both idling and varying load conditions.</p>

				<title>A method for unbalanced transportation problems in fuzzy environment</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0573-0581</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we consider the fully fuzzy unbalanced transportation problem in which the total availability/production is more than the total demand and propose a method to solve it. Such problems are usually solved by adding a dummy destination. Since the dummy destination has no existence in reality, the excess availability is not transported at all and is held back at one or more origins. The method proposed in this paper gives the additional information that to which of the destination(s) the excess availability be transported for future demand at minimum cost. The advantage of the proposed method over the existing method is that the fuzzy optimal solution obtained does not involve the dummy destination. The method has been illustrated with the help of an example.</p>

				<title>Stability analysis of non-axisymmetric three-dimensional finite element rotor models with partial and full mass lumping</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0597-0606</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Unlike structural dynamics, the three-dimensional finite-element model of non-axisymmetric rotors on orthotropic bearings generates a large gyroscopic system with parametric stiffness. The present work explores the use of mass-lumping in stability analysis of such systems. Using a variant of Hill’s method, the problem reduces to a generalized Eigen value problem of order $nm \times nm$, with $n$ as the order of the system in state vector representation and $m$ as the number of terms in the assumed solution. The matrices in both the sides of the Eigen value problem are expressed in terms of Kronecker products where the mass-matrix appears twice as a sub-matrix in both the sides of the equation. A particular one or both of them can be made diagonal. Both options produce sufficiently accurate results with considerable savings, even with a coarse mesh.</p>

					<p>An exact dynamic stiffness method is presented in this paper to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the axially loaded double-beam systems,which consist of two homogeneous and prismatic beams with a distributed spring in parallel between them.The effects of the axial force, shear deformation and rotary inertia are considered, as shown in the theoretical formulation. The dynamic stiffness influence coefficients are formulated from the governing differential equations of the axially loaded double-beam system in free vibration by using the Laplace transform method. An example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, in which ten boundary conditions are investigated and the effect of the axial force on the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the double-beam system are further discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this research work, extensive literature review of the rotational moulding process using linear low density polythene (LLDPE) has been carried out to summarize the present status of the characterization in order to maintain quality and reliability of the products.The present characterization of rotomoulded products using LLDPE is based on the mechanical properties which are being altered by changing process parameters. However, it is observed that in the majority of applications of the products made of LLDPE using rotational moulding technology are prone to cracking failure due to manufacturing defects at room temperature. Therefore, study of fracture characterization of the material is equally important in relation to quality and reliability. In this article, the present characterization of the rotational moulded products using different polymers is summarized in the form of review and the importance of evaluation of the fracture behaviour of rotomoulded products is emphasized.</p>

				<title>Design of RC frames for pre-selected collapse mechanism and target displacement using energy–balance</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0637-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In earthquake-prone countries, structures may be exposed to several seismic loads in any stage of building’s life. It is expected that the structures designed by engineers will show ductile behaviour under the effect of vertical and lateral loads and remain stable without making a sudden collapse. In consequence of nonlinear behaviour, plastic hinges are expected to form in structural members which are under the effect of external loads. Earthquake input energy is dissipated in plastic hinges, so, structures behave ductile. In this study, total energy of RC frames is calculated and the energy–based base shear force is determined by equating the total internal energy to the work done by external lateral design forces for pre-selected target displacement and collapse mechanism. Sections of RC frames are controlled if they can resist the calculated design lateral loads or not. If the capacity of the sections cannot withstand the external design loads, the design is rearranged and new sections are chosen. Beam and column sections that can resist the design loads securely are accepted as final sections of the energy–based design methodology. Pre-selected target displacement for desired performance level is checked using the results of nonlinear analyses. The results of the presented design methodology in this study are compatible with the results of nonlinear analyses.</p>

				<title>Behavioural analysis of a time series–A chaotic approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0659-0676</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Out of the various methods available to study the chaotic behaviour, correlation dimension method (CDM) derived from Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm and False Nearest Neighbour method (FNN) are widely used. It is aimed to study the adaptability of those techniques for Indian rainfall data that is dominated by monsoon. In the present study, five sets of time series data are analyzed using correlation dimension method (CDM) based upon Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm for studying their behaviour. In order to confirm the results arrived from correlation dimension method, FNN and phase randomisation method is also applied to the time series used in the present study to fix the optimum embedding dimension. First series is a deterministic natural number series, the next two series are random number series with two types of distributions; one is uniform and another is normal distributed random number series. The fourth series is Henon data, an erratic data generated from a deterministic non linear equation (classified as chaotic series). After checking the applicability of correlation dimension method for deterministic, stochastic and chaotic data (known series) the method is applied to a rainfall time series observed at Koyna station, Maharashtra, India for its behavioural study. The results obtained from the chaotic analysis revealed that CDM is an efficient method for behavioural study of a time series. It also provides first hand information on the number of dimensions to be considered for time series prediction modelling. The CDM applied to real life rainfall data brings out the nature of rainfall at Koyna station as chaotic. For the rainfall data, CDM resulted in a minimum correlation dimension of one and optimum dimension as five. FNN method also resulted in five dimensions for the rainfall data. The behaviour of the rainfall time series is further confirmed by phase randomisation technique also. The surrogate data derived from randomisation gives entirely different results when compared to the other two techniques used in the present study (CDM and FNN) which confirms the behaviour of rainfall as chaotic. It is also seen that CDM is underestimating the correlation dimension, may be due to higher percentage of zero values in rainfall data. Thus, one should appropriately check the adaptability of CDM for time series having longer zero values.</p>

				<title>Elastic properties of RCC under flexural loading-experimental and analytical approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0677-0697</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In structural analysis,especially in indeterminate structures, it becomes essential to know material and geometrical properties of members. The codal provisions recommend elastic properties of concrete and steel and these are fairly accurate enough. The stress–strain curve for concrete cylinder or a cube specimen is plotted. The slope of this curve is modulus of elasticity of plain concrete. Another method of determining modulus of elasticity of concrete is by flexural test of a beam specimen. The modulus of elasticity most commonly used for concrete is secant modulus. The modulus of elasticity of steel is obtained by performing a tension test of steel bar. While performing analysis by any software for high rise building, cross area of plain concrete is taken into consideration whereas effects of reinforcement bars and concrete confined by stirrups are neglected. The aim of study is to determine elastic properties of reinforced cement concrete material. Two important stiffness properties such as AE and EI play important role in analysis of high rise RCC building idealized as plane frame. The experimental programme consists of testing of beams (model size 150 $\times$ 150 $\times$ 700 mm) with percentage of reinforcement varying from 0.54 to 1.63%. The experimental results are verified by using 3D finite element techniques. This study refers to the effect of variation of percentage of main longitudinal reinforcement and concrete grade. Effect of confinement is not considered and it appears in a separate study.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An $in situ$ pushover test is carried out on an old building of Guan-Miao elementary school in south Taiwan. Columns of this building are seismically retrofitted with steel plate. The DIC (digital-image-correlation) technique is used to measure the deformation of the retrofitted column. The result shows that the DIC technique can be successfully applied to measure the relative displacement of the column. Additionally, thismethod leads to the measurement of relative displacements formany points on the column simultaneously. Hence, the column deformation curve, rotation and curvature can be determined using interpolation method. The resulting curvaturediagram reveals that the phenomenon of plastic hinge occurs at about 2% storey drift ratio, and that the DIC technique can be applied to measure column deformation in a full scale $in situ$ test.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The mean flowfield of a turbulent jet issuing into a confined, uniform counterflow was investigated computationally. Based on dimensional analysis, the jet penetration length was shown to scale with jet-to-counterflow momentum flux ratio. This scaling and the computational results reproduce the well-known correct limit of linear growth of the jet penetration length for the unconfined case when the momentum flux ratio is small. However, for the high momentum flux ratio case corresponding to the confinement, the jet penetration length is shown to reach an asymptotic limit of about 3.57 times the confining duct diameter. This conclusion is contrary to the existing results which predict indefinite growth. A simple modification of an existing similarity solution for the jet in an unconfined counterflow provides a convenient framework for presenting the results of the flowfield and jet penetration length.</p>

				<title>Probability density fittings of corrosion test-data: Implications on $C_6H_{15}NO_3$ effectiveness on concrete steel-rebar corrosion</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0731-0764</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, corrosion test-data of steel-rebar in concrete were subjected to the fittings of the Normal, Gumbel and the Weibull probability distribution functions. This was done to investigate the suitability of the results of the fitted test-data, by these distributions, for modelling the effectiveness of $C_6H_{15}NO_3$, triethanolamine (TEA), admixtures on the corrosion of steel-rebar in concrete in $NaCl$ and in $H_2SO_4$ test-media. For this, six different concentrations of TEA were admixed in replicates of steel-reinforced concrete samples which were immersed in the saline/marine and the microbial/industrial simulating test-environments for seventy-five days. From these, distribution fittings of the non-destructive electrochemical measurements were subjected to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistics and to the analyses of variance modelling for studying test-data compatibility to the fittings and testing significance. Although all fittings of test-data followed similar trends of significant testing, the fittings of the corrosion rate test data followed the Weibull more than the Normal and the Gumbel distribution fittings, thus supporting use of the Weibull fittings for modelling effectiveness. The effectiveness models on rebar corrosion, based on these, identified 0.083% TEA with optimal inhibition efficiency, $\eta =$ 72.17$\pm$10.68%, in $NaCl$ medium while 0.667% TEA was the only admixture with positive effectiveness, $\eta =$ 56.45$\pm$15.85%, in $H_2SO_4$ medium. These results bear implications on the concentrations of TEA for effective corrosion protection of concrete steel-rebar in saline/marine and in industrial/microbial environments.</p>

				<page>0785-0808</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Background subtraction is one of the efficient techniques to segment the targets from non-informative background of a video. The traditional background subtraction technique suits for videos with static background whereas the video obtained from unmanned aerial vehicle has dynamic background. Here, we propose an algorithm with tuning factor and Gaussian update for surveillance videos that suits effectively for aerial videos. The tuning factor is optimized by extracting the statistical features of the input frames.With the optimized tuning factor and Gaussian update an adaptive Gaussian-based background subtraction technique is proposed. The algorithm involves modelling, update and subtraction phases. This running Gaussian average based background subtraction technique uses updation at both model generation phase and subtraction phase. The resultant video extracts the moving objects from the dynamic background. Sample videos of various properties such as cluttered background, small objects, moving background and multiple objects are considered for evaluation. The technique is statistically compared with frame differencing technique, temporal median method and mixture of Gaussian model and performance evaluation is done to check the effectiveness of the proposed technique after optimization for both static and dynamic videos.</p>

				<page>0819-0841</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Microgrids (MGs) are Low Voltage distribution networks comprising various distributed generators (DG), storage devices and controllable loads that can operate either interconnected or isolated from the main distribution grid as a controlled entity. Energy storage system (ESS) is a vital part of an MG. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for the optimal allocation and economic analysis of ESS in MGs on the basis of net present value (NPV). As the optimal operation of an MG strongly depends on the arrangement and allocation of its ESS, economic operation strategies and optimal allocation methods of the ESS devices are required for the MG. Self-adaptive Bee Swarm Optimization (SBSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the operation strategies and capacities of ESS in MGs in order to find maximal NPV, the generation schedule of ESS and distributed generation sources. This paper is to suggest, among those available ESS, the optimal sizes and types of them and their optimal arrangement, such that the total NPV achieved during the system operational lifetime period is maximized. After introducing the methodology, a case study is presented for illustration.</p>

				<page>0843-0858</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) are widely used to distribute data to large number of users. Traditionally, content is being replicated among a number of surrogate servers, leading to high operational costs. In this context, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) CDNs have emerged as a viable alternative. An issue of concern in P2P networks is that of $free$ $riders$, i.e., selfish peers who download files and leave without uploading anything in return. Free riding must be discouraged. In this paper, we propose a criterion, the $Give-and-Take$ ($G&amp;T$) $criterion$, that disallows free riders. Incorporating the $G&amp;T$ criterion in our model, we study a problem that arises naturally when a new peer enters the system: viz., the problem of downloading a ‘universe’ of segments, scattered among other peers, at low cost. We analyse this $NP$−hard problem, and characterize the optimal download cost under the $G&amp;T$ criterion.We propose an optimal algorithm, and provide a sub-optimal algorithm that is nearly optimal, but runs much more quickly; this provides an attractive balance between running time and performance. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithms with that of a few existing P2P downloading strategies in use. We also study the computation time for prescribing the strategy for initial segment and peer selection for the newly arrived peer for various existing and proposed algorithms, and quantify cost–computation time trade-offs.</p>

				<title>Design and implementation of PV-based three-phase four-wire series hybrid active power filter for power quality improvement</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0859-0877</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>This paper proposes a Photovoltaic (PV)-based three-phase four-wire Series Hybrid Active Power Filter (SHAPF), it comprises of a Series Active Power Filter (SAPF) and an LC shunt passive filter. The proposed system eliminates both the current and voltage harmonics and compensates reactive power, neutral current and voltage interruption. A SAPF demands a source of energy for compensating the voltage sag/swell. This system found a new topology for SHAPF which utilizes the PV with DC–DC boost converter as a source of DC power for the series active filter. The compensation current reference evaluation is based on the twin formulation of the vectorial theory of electrical power theorem with Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The PV array/battery managed DC–DC boost converter is employed to step up the voltage to meet the DC bus voltage requirement of the three-leg Voltage Source Inverter (VSI). The foremost benefit of the proposed system is that, it will provide uninterrupted compensation for the whole day. This system utilizes the renewable energy; accordingly saves the energy and provides the uninterruptable power supply to critical/sensitive load, through the PV array/battery bank during both day time and night time. An experimental model was established and results were obtained, which indicated the capability of the proposed control scheme.</p>

				<title>An adaptive image denoising method based on local parameters optimization</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0879-0900</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>In image denoising algorithms, the noise is handled by either modifying term-by-term, i.e., individual pixels or block-by-block, i.e., group of pixels, using suitable shrinkage factor and threshold function. The shrinkage factor is generally a function of threshold and some other characteristics of the neighbouring pixels of the pixel to be thresholded (denoised). The threshold is determined in terms of the noise variance present in the image and its size. The VisuShrink, SureShrink, and NeighShrink methods are important denoising methods that provide good results. The first two, i.e., VisuShrink and SureShrink methods follow term-by-term approach, i.e., modify the individual pixel and the third one, i.e., NeighShrink and its variants: ModiNeighShrink, IIDMWD, and IAWDMBMC, follow block-by-block approach, i.e., modify the pixels in groups, in order to remove the noise. The VisuShrink, SureShrink, and NeighShrink methods however do not give very good visual quality because they remove too many coefficients due to their high threshold values. In this paper, we propose an image denoising method that uses the local parameters of the neighbouring coefficients of the pixel to be denoised in the noisy image. In our method, we propose two new shrinkage factors and the threshold at each decomposition level, which lead to better visual quality. We also establish the relationship between both the shrinkage factors. We compare the performance of our method with that of the VisuShrink and NeighShrink including various variants. Simulation results show that our proposed method has high peak signal-to-noise ratio and good visual quality of the image as compared to the traditional methods:Weiner filter, VisuShrink, SureShrink, NeighBlock, NeighShrink, ModiNeighShrink, LAWML, IIDMWT, and IAWDMBNC methods.</p>

                    <p>A high power (2 kW, CW) magnetron-based microwave system operating at 2.45 GHz has been designed, tested, characterized, and used to produce plasma. The system consists of a microwave source, an isolator, a directional coupler, a threestub tuner, a high voltage break, a microwave vacuum window, and a microwave launcher. These microwave components were simulated using microwave studio software. The low power and full term characterization of the microwave system has been done using vector network analyzer. The system was tested for 2 kW continuous wave of microwave power using glass-water load. The microwave system has been developed to study the microwave interaction with plasma at different operation regimes (Gases: Nitrogen, argon and hydrogen; Gas pressure : $10^{−5}–10^{−3}$ mbar; Microwave power : 300–1000W; Magnetic field: 875–1000 G) and to extract the proton beam current with hydrogen produced plasma. A plasma density $\sim$5×10${}^{11}$ cm${}^{−3}$ and average electron temperature of $\sim$13 eV was obtained. This article describes various aspects of the microwave system including design, fabrication, characterization and performance studies of the microwave components.</p>

				<title>Electrocardiogram de-noising based on forward wavelet transform translation invariant application in bionic wavelet domain</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0921-0937</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>In this paper, we propose a new technique of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal de-noising based on thresholding of the coefficients obtained from the application of the Forward Wavelet Transform Translation Invariant (FWT_TI) to each Bionic Wavelet coefficient. The De-noise De-noised ECG is obtained from the application of the inverse of $BWT$ ($BWT^{−1}$) to the de-noise de-noised bionic wavelet coefficients. For evaluating this new proposed de-noising technique, we have compared it to a thresholding technique in the FWT_TI domain. Preliminary tests of the application of the two de-noising techniques were constructed on a number of ECG signals taken from MIT-BIH database. The obtained results from Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) computations showed that our proposed de-noising technique outperforms the second technique. We have also compared the proposed technique to the thresholding technique in the bionic wavelet domain and this comparison was performed by SNR improvement computing. The obtained results from this evaluation showed that the proposed technique also outperforms the de-noising technique based on bionic wavelet coefficients thresholding.</p>

The proposed scheme fundamentally is concerned about the frequency of occurrence of the image brightness values of the cover image for the data embedding procedures. The proposed scheme effectively realizes both perceptual invisibility and statistical invisibility so that obtained covered images are highly robust against common perceptual and statistical steganalysis techniques. The scheme provides reasonably higher payload values than its counterparts, as well as providing comparatively improved PSNR results.</p>

				<title>Correlation between optical emission spectra and the process parameters of a 915 MHz microwave plasma CVD reactor used for depositing polycrystalline diamond coatings</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0957-0970</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>In this paper, the hydrogen and hydrogen-methane mixed plasma have been generated inside a 33 cm diameter quartz bell jar with a low power (9 KW) and lower frequency 915 MHz microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition system. The reactor is being used for growing polycrystalline diamond (PCD) over large area (100 mm). The generated plasma is diagnosed by $in$ $situ$ optical emission spectroscopy method with wave length ranging from 200 to 900 nm. The effects of microwave power, chamber pressure and gas concentration on plasma characteristics have been studied in this work. Within the optical range, Balmer $H_{\alpha}$, $H_{\beta}$, $C_2$swan band and CH lines have been detected at the wavelengths of 655.95, 485.7, 515.82 and 430.17 nm, respectively. It has been observed that for hydrogen plasma, the amount of transition from hydrogen atom inner shell 3 to 2 $(H_{\alpha})$ is almost constant with increasing microwave (MW) power (from 2000 to 2800 W) and pressure (from 15 to 30 Torr) initially, after that it increases with further increase of MW power and pressure, whereas, the transition from 4 to 2 $(H_{\beta})$ is slowly increased with increasing MW power and pressure. For hydrogen-methane plasma, intensities of $C_2$ swan band, i.e., the transitions from $D^3\Pi_g$ to $A^3\Pi_{\mu}$ energy levels, are also increased with the increasing microwave power and reactor pressure. It has been observed that the radicals present in the plasma are affected by variation of different reactor parameters like pressure, MW power, $CH_4$ concentration, etc.</p>

				<title>An improved adaptive wavelet shrinkage for ultrasound despeckling</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0971-0988</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Ultrasound imaging is the most widely used medical diagnostic technique for clinical decision making, due to its ability to make real time imaging for moving structures, low cost and safety. However, its usefulness is degraded by the presence of signal dependent speckle noise. Several wavelet-based denoising schemes have been reported in the literature for the removal of speckle noise. This study proposes a new and improved adaptive wavelet shrinkage in the translational invariant domain. It exploits the knowledge of the correlation of the wavelet coefficients within and across the resolution scales. A preliminary coefficient classification representing useful image information and noise is performed with a novel inter-scale dependency measure. The spatial context adaptation of the wavelet coefficients within a subband is achieved by a local spatial adaptivity indicator, determined by using a truncation threshold. A weighted signal variance is estimated based on this measure and used in the determination of a subband adaptive threshold. The proposed thresholding function aims to reduce the fixed bias of the soft thresholding approach. Experiments conducted with the proposed filter are compared with the existing filtering algorithms in terms of Peak-Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), Structural Similarity IndexMeasure (SSIM), Equivalent Number of Looks (ENL) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI). A comparison of the results shows that the proposed filter achieves an improvement in terms of quantitative measures and in terms of visual quality of the images.</p>

				<title>Applicability of Doppler weather radar based rainfall data for runoff estimation in Indian watersheds – A case study of Chennai basin</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0989-0997</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Traditionally, India has been vulnerable to various hazards such as floods, droughts and cyclones. About 8% of the total Indian landmass is prone to cyclones. A number of Doppler weather radars are installed in India and their products are utilized for weather predictions and detection of cyclones approaching the Indian coast. Radar-based hydrological studies in various countries have proven that computation of runoff using radar rainfall data could outperform rain gauge network measurements. There are no reported studies on their utilization for hydrological modelling and/or flood-related studies in Indian river basins. A comparison study between Doppler weather radar (DWR) derived rainfall data and the conventional rain gauge data was carried out with hourly inputs at one of the watersheds of Chennai basin, Tamil Nadu, India using HEC-HMS model. The model calibration and validation were performed by comparing the simulated outflow with the observed daily outflow data. The calibrated model was used to predict runoff from two post-monsoon cyclonic storm events with hourly inputs. It was noticed that the discrepancy in the runoff volume was small, but the difference in the peak flow was substantial. Additionally, there was a variation at the time to peak flow using daily and hourly inputs. The results show that the use of radar data may be optional for runoff volume estimation for the watersheds with sufficient rain gauge density, but highly desirable for peak flow and time to peak estimation. Therefore, the DWR derived rainfall data is a promising input for runoff estimation, especially in urban flood modelling.</p>

The salt used for the study is Lithium perchlorate ($LiClO_4$). The morphology and percentage of crystallinity data were obtained through X-ray Diffraction and Differential Scanning Caloriemetry. The ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolytes was studied by impedance spectroscopy. The addition of MMT resulted in an increase in conductivity over the temperature range of 25–60$^\circ $C. The ionic conductivity of a composite polymer electrolyte containing 1.2 wt% MMT was 1 $\times$ 10$^{−5}$ S cm${}^{−1}$ at 25$^\circ $C, which is at least one order of magnitude higher than that of the polymer electrolyte (4 $\times$ 10$^{−7}$S cm${}^{−1}$). The increase in ionic conductivity is explained on the basis of crystallinity of the polymer electrolyte.</p>

The structure under consideration is immersed in water and subjected to longitudinal ultrasonic waves at specific angles of incidence using a cylindrical piezoelectric transducer using the surrounding water as coupling medium. Suitable ultrasonic guided wave modes with optimum scanning capabilities have been generated and identified in submerged plate system. Finally, the propagation of selected modes through submerged notched plates is investigated. Sensitivity of leaky waves to the notches has been studied.

				<page>1035-1053</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>This paper investigates the effect of different cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) on surface integrity defined in terms of surface roughness and microhardness in dry hard turning process. The workpiece material used was hardened alloy steel AISI 52100 and it was machined on a CNC lathe with coated carbide tool under different settings of cutting parameters. Three cutting parameters each at three levels were considered in the study. Central composite design (CCD) of experiment was used to collect experimental data for surface roughness and microhardness. Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine significance of the cutting parameters. The results were analysed using an effective procedure of response surface methodology (RSM) to determine optimal values of cutting parameters. Several diagnostic tests were also performed to check the validity of assumptions. The results indicated that feed rate is the dominant factor affecting the surface roughness whereas the cutting speed is found to be the dominant factor affecting the microhardness. Results also revealed that within the range investigated, good surface integrity is achieved when feed rate and depth of cut are near their low levels and cutting speed is at high level. Finally, the optimal cutting parameters and model equations to predict the surface roughness and microhardness are proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>In this paper, an optimization study was carried out for the cutting force ($F_c$) acting on circular diamond sawblades in rock sawing. The peripheral speed, traverse speed, cut depth and flow rate of cooling fluid were considered as operating variables and optimized by using Taguchi approach for the $F_c$. $L_{16}$($4^4$) orthogonal array was chosen for the experimental trials based on the operating variables and their levels. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed to determine optimum cutting conditions and significant operating variables, respectively. The $F_c$ was also modelled based on the operating variables using regression analysis. The developed model was then verified using various statistical approaches. The results revealed that the operating variables of circular diamond sawblades can be precisely optimized by Taguchi approach for the $F_c$ in rock sawing. The cut depth and peripheral speed were statistically determined as the significant operating variables affecting $F_c$. Furthermore, the modelling results showed that the proposed model can be effectively used for the prediction of $F_c$ in practical applications.</p>

Both linear and bi-linear reconstruction techniques are tested for extrapolation of velocity near a complex boundary. The present method is tested for vortical flow in an inclined cavity, flow past circular and inclined square cylinder. Both homogeneous and non-homogeneous Dirichlet forcing problems are tested.

				<abstract>
                    <p>The work presented in this paper is related to symbols and toponym understanding with application to scanned Indian topographic maps. The proposed algorithm deals with colour layer separation of enhanced topographic map using kmeans colour segmentation followed by outline detection and chaining, respectively. Outline detection is performed through linear filtering using canny edge detector. Outline is then encoded in a Freeman way, the x-y offsets have been used to obtain a complex representation of outlines. Final matching of shapes is done by computing Fourier descriptors from the chain-codes; comparison of descriptors having same colour index is embedded in a normalized scalar product of descriptors. As this matching process is not rotation invariant (starting point selection), an interrelation function has been proposed to make the method shifting invariant. The recognition rates of symbols, letters and numbers are 84.68, 91.73 and 92.19%, respectively. The core contribution is dedicated to a shape analysis method based on contouring and Fourier descriptors. To improve recognition rate, obtaining most optimal segmentation solution for complex topographic map will be the future scope of work.</p>

				<title>Mathematical modelling on transport of petroleum hydrocarbons in saturated fractured rocks</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1119-1139</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The present paper addresses critical issues that describe the dissolution mass transfer of petroleum hydrocarbons in a saturated subsurface system. The field procedure associated with the estimation of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (LNAPL) thickness in site monitor wells is revisited. A brief theory has been included on the composition and transport of petroleum hydrocarbons following an onshore oil spill in order to demonstrate the level of complexity associated with the LNAPL dissolution mass transfer even in a classical porous medium. However, such studies in saturated fractured rocks are highly complex and limited, and hence, deserve a special attention as the fate and transport of the petroleum hydrocarbons are not uncommon in saturated fractured rocks. In this context, an improved mathematical model has been proposed that will better describe the dissolution kinetics of petroleum hydrocarbons in saturated fractured rocks at the scale of a single fracture using dual-porosity concept. The lumped mass transfer coefficient in a classical porous medium proposed depends on mean grain size, while the same parameter has been replaced by an equivalent average thickness of fracture aperture that better describes the LNAPL dissolution rate in a coupled fracture-matrix system. A set of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations is deduced for a coupled fracture-matrix system in analogy with the differential equations of a classical porous medium. The proposed mathematical model may work well for the fracture aperture thicknesses varying between 100 and 500 microns with a relatively low Reynolds Number and initial NAPL saturation.</p>

The objective of this article is to reveal the effectiveness of texture feature analysis for detecting the abnormalities in digitized mammograms using Self Adaptive Resource Allocation Network (SRAN) classifier. Thus, we proposed a feature set based on Gabor filters, fractal analysis, multiscale surrounding region dependence method (MSRDM) to identify the most common appearance of breast cancer namely microcalcification, masses and architectural distortion. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed features with SRAN classifier can improve the classification performance. The SRAN classifier produces the classification accuracy of 98.44% for the proposed features with 192 images from MIAS dataset.</p>

                    <p>In this paper, we consider the optimal sensors placement problem for faults detection and isolation using a novel structural and qualitative approach. This approach is based on the conversion of Bond Graph to Digraph representation of a structural system. When the fault detection and isolation of an existing system’s sensors are impossible or uncertain, a reconfiguration sensor placement of this system should be reconsidered. This paper proposes how this reconfiguration takes place by recovering all missing or redundant parts of the system. This novel approach is illustrated over a thermo-fluid application.</p>

                    <p>Live bed scour experiments were conducted using four types of noncohesive bed sediments with median diameters $d_{50}$ $=$ 0.26 mm, 0.42 mm, 1.06 mm and 1.92 mm and five $45^\circ$ wing-wall abutments of lengths l = 0.04 m, 0.06 m, 0.08 m, 0.10 m and 0.12 m. The tests were conducted in the range of flow velocity varies from 0.71 to 5 times of the critical velocity. The plotting of non-dimensional scour depths (scour depths/abutment lengths) vs non-dimensional flow intensity (flow intensity/critical velocity) show one peak value of scour depth close to the threshold velocity and thereafter, it reduces and again attain a live-bed maximum in the range of flow intensity 3 to 5 times of the critical velocity. It is also observed that the scour depth increases with the increase in sediment sizes up to threshold value of flow for all sediment sizes and abutment lengths. Further, the scour depth decreases with the increase of non-uniformity under all flow conditions. A design equation is proposed for estimating maximum scour depth at $45^\circ$wing-wall abutment under live-bed condition. The calculated values of scour depths using proposed equation, and also with three different live-bed local scour equations, are compared with the measured values of scour depths.</p>

				<title>Exterior beam-column joint study with non-conventional reinforcement detailing using mechanical anchorage under reversal loading</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1185-1200</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Reinforced concrete structures beam-column joints are the most critical regions in seismic prone areas. Proper reinforcement anchorage is essential to enhance the performance of the joints. An attempt has been made to appraise the performance of the anchorages and joints. The anchorages are detailed as per ACI-352 (mechanical anchorages), ACI-318 (conventional bent hooks) and IS-456 (conventional full anchorage). The joints are detailed without confinement in group-I and with additional X-cross bar in group-II. To assess the seismic performance, the specimens are assembled into two groups of three specimens each and were tested under reversal loading, The specimen with T-type mechanical anchorage (Headed bar) and T-type mechanical anchorage combination with X-cross bar exhibited significant improvement in seismic performance: load-displacement capacity, displacement ductility, stiffness degradation, controlled crack capacity in the joint shear panel and also reduced congestion of reinforcement in joint core.</p>

				<title>Vortices in dam reservoir: A case study of Karun III dam</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1201-1209</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The present study focuses on the effect of vortex formation on plane velocities in a reservoir. Velocity measurements are performed in the hydraulic model of Karun III dam and hydropower plant. Different vortices were produced at the horizontal intake by changing the submerged depth. Tangential velocities were measured on a rectangular mesh in the reservoir. The results were then processed to plot the contour lines of the plane velocities and study the effect of vortex formation on the flow condition in the reservoir. Contour lines in different submerged depths show that circulation zones are formed in different potential locations over the intakes causing vortex formation. These results were correlated with the location of the appearing vortices observed in the experiments. Experimental data of this study could be useful for numerical modelling of vortex in the reservoirs.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>In this paper Spalding’s formulation for the law of the wall with constants modified by Persen is used to describe the inner region (viscous sub-layer and certain portion of logarithmic layer) and a wake law due to Persen is used to describe the wake region (outer region). These two laws are examined in the light of measured data by Marušić and Perry for non-equilibrium adverse pressure gradient layers. It is observed that structure of turbulence for this flow is well-described by these two laws. From the known structure of turbulence eddy viscosity for the flow under consideration is calculated. Self similarity in eddy viscosity is observed in the wall region.</p>

				<title>Impact of pipes networks simplification on water hammer phenomenon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1227-1244</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Simplification of water supply networks is an indispensible design step to make the original network easier to be analysed. The impact of networks’ simplification on water hammer phenomenon is investigated. This study uses two loops network with different diameters, thicknesses, and roughness coefficients. The network is fed from a boundary head reservoir and loaded by either distributed or concentrated boundary water demands. According to both hydraulic and hydraulic plus water quality equivalence, three simplification levels are performed. The effect of demands’ concentration on the transient flow is checked. The transient flow is initialized by either concentrated or distributed boundary demands which are suddenly shut-off or released. WHAMO software is used for simulation. All scenarios showed that both hydraulic equivalence and demands’ concentration simplifications increase the transient pressure and flow rate. However, hydraulic plus water quality equivalence simplification produces an adverse effect. Therefore, simplifications of the networks should be done carefully. Also, it was found that pump shut-off gives the same trend of valve shut-off or release.</p>

				<title>Experimental studies of local scour in the pressurized OCF below a wooden log across the flow</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1245-1257</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The proposed study examined and reviewed the published experimental results related to clear water scour below a cylinder across the flow. It also highlighted the limitations of existing methods for estimating the scour depth below a submerged cylinder. In the present study, experiments were performed for 50% and 75% submergences of a 70 mm diameter cylinder in the free surface flow over a uniform sand bed with $d_{50}$ $=$ 0.98 mm downstream of an apron. Based on the experimental results, an empirical equation was proposed to estimate the amount of gap flow between the cylinder and the bed for an equilibrium scour for a given flow depth and sediment properties. Measured scour profile consisted of a scour hole and immediately followed by a dune. However, no general sediment transport was occurring away from the cylinder due to the undisturbed bed shear stress less than or equal to the critical shear stress required for the sediment entrainment. Different submergence ratios of the cylinder resulted in different longitudinal and vertical extensions of the scour hole and the dune. The maximum equilibrium scour depth occurred when the cylinder is fully submerged in the unidirectional flow with water depth equals to the cylinder diameter. The non-dimensional measured scour profiles were found to be similar. The characteristic lengths of the scour hole and the dune were computed analytically by approximating the measured scour profile by third degree polynomials. The computed non-dimensional scour profiles compared satisfactorily with the measured profiles. It was found that analytical non-dimensional scour profiles were identical for a given diameter of a cylinder with different submergences for the same flow conditions.</p>
