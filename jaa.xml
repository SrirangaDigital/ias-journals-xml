				<title>A Measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature at 1280MHz</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The absolute temperature of the cosmic microwave back-ground (CMB) has been measured at a frequency of 1280 MHz. The observation was made with a modified version of the L-band receiver used in the Giant Metre wavelength Radio Telescope (GMRT): the feed horn was replaced by a corrugated plate and the receiver was placed on the ground, directed at zenith, and shielded from ground radiation by an aluminium screen with corrugated edges. Novel techniques have been adopted for</p>
					<ul>
						<li>reducing and cancelling unwanted contributions to the system temperature of the receiver and</li>
						<li>calibrating the contributions from the feed assembly and receiver.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The thermodynamic temperature of the CMB is estimated to be $3.45 \pm 0.78$ K.</p>

				<title>Nature of the Background Ultraviolet Radiation Field at High Redshifts</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0019-0027</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have tried to determine the flux of the ultraviolet background radiation field from the column density ratios of various ions in several absorption systems observed in the spectra of QSOs. We find that in most cases the flux is considerably higher than what has been estimated to be contributed by the AGNs. The excess flux could originate locally in hot stars. In a few cases we have been able to show that such galactic flux can only contribute a part of the total required flux. The results suggest that the background gets a significant contribution from an unseen QSO population.</p>

				<title>X-ray Observation of XTE J2012+381 during the 1998 Outburst</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0029-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The outburst of X-ray transient source XTE J2012+381 was detected by the RXTE All-Sky Monitor on 1998 May 24th. Following the outburst, X-ray observations of the source were made in the 2-18keV energy band with the Pointed Proportional Counters of the Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment (IXAE) on-board the Indian satellite IRS-P3 during 1998 June 2nd-10th. The X-ray flux of the source in the main outburst decreased exponentially during the period of observation. No large amplitude short-term variability in the intensity is detected from the source. The power density spectrum obtained from the timing analysis of the data shows no indication of any quasi-periodic oscillations in 0.002-0.5 Hz band. The hardness ratio i.e. the ratio of counts in 6-18 keV to 2-6 keV band, indicates that the X-ray spectrum is soft with spectral index $\gt$ 2. From the similarities of the X-ray properties with those of other black hole transients, we conclude that the X-ray transient XTE J2012+381 is likely to be a black hole.</p>

These new near-infrared data provide insight into the structure of the thin disk of our Galaxy, The interpretation of star counts and color distributions of stars in the near-infrared with the synthetic stellar population model, gives strong evidence that the Galactic thin disk density scale length, $h_{R}$, is rather short ($2.7 \pm 0.1$ kpc).</p>

				<title>Stellar Sources in the ISOGAL Inner Galactic Bulge Field $(l=0^{0},b=-1^{0})$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0077-0090</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>ISOGAL is a survey at 7 and 15 μm with ISOCAM of the inner galactic disk and bulge of our Galaxy. The survey covers $\sim 22$ deg$^{2}$ in selected areas of the central $l=\pm 30$ degree of the inner Galaxy. In this paper, we report the study of a small ISOGAL field in the inner galactic bulge ($l = 0^{0},b = -1^{0}$, area = 0.033deg$^{2}$). Using the multicolor near-infrared data (IJK$_{s}$) of DENIS (DEep Near Infrared Southern Sky Survey) and mid-infrared ISOGAL data, we discuss the nature of the ISOGAL sources. The various color-color and color-magnitude diagrams are discussed in the paper. While most of the detected sources are red giants (RGB tip stars), a few of them show an excess in J-K$_{s}$ and K$_{s}$-[15] colors with respect to the red giant sequence. Most of them are probably AGB stars with large mass-loss rates.</p>

				<title>Porous and Fluffy Grains in the Regions of Anomalous Extinction</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0091-0099</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has long been established that the ratio of total to selective extinction is anomalously large (³ 5) in certain regions of the interstellar medium. In these regions of anomalous extinction the dust grains are likely to be irregular in shape and fluffy in structure. Using discrete dipole approximation (DDA) we calculate the extinction for porous and fluffy grains. We apply DDA first to solid spheroidal particles assumed to be made of a certain (large) number of dipoles. Then we systematically reduce the number of dipoles to model the porous grains. The aggregates of these particles are suggested to form the fluffy grains. We study the extinction for these particles as a function of grain size, porosity and wavelength. We apply these calculations to interpret the observed extinction data in the regions of star formation (e.g. the Orion complex).</p>

				<title>Results from Kodaikanal Synoptic Observations</title>
				<feature>Session II – Synoptic Observations</feature>
				<page>0149-0153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The synoptic observations of Kodaikanal form one of the longest unbroken solar data from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day, and consists of the white light and monochromatic images of the sun. In this review, I shall discuss the results of the investigations in two areas using these data:</p> 
					<ol type="roman">
						<li>Tilt angles of the magnetic axes of bipolar spot groups, and</li> 
						<li>structure and dynamics of large scale unipolar magnetic regions on the solar surface.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The observed properties and patterns of behaviour of the tilt angles can be used as effective diagnostics to infer the physical conditions in the subsurface layers of the sun, and thus get an insight into the physical effects that act on the rising magnetic flux tubes during their journey through the convection zone to the surface.</p>
					<p>The second topic of discussion here, namely, the studies of the dynamics of unipolar regions over several solar cycles, show that the global solar activity has a high latitude component which manifests in the form of polar faculae, in addition to the well known sunspot activity at the middle and low latitudes. This raises the question about the origin of this high latitude component.</p>

				<title>22-Year Periodicity in the Solar Differential Rotation</title>
				<feature>Session III – Sunspots &amp; Solar Cycle</feature>
				<page>0167-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the data on sunspot groups compiled during 1879-1975, we determined variations in the differential rotation coefficients $A$ and $Β$ during the solar cycle. The variation in the equatorial rotation rate $A$ is found to be significant only in the odd numbered cycles, with an amplitude $\sim 0.01$ $\mu$rads$^{-1}$. There exists a good anticorrelation between the variations of the differential rotation rate $Β$ derived from the odd and even numbered cycles, suggesting existence of a '22-year' periodicity in $B$. The amplitude of the variation of $Β$ is $\sim 0.05$ $\mu$ rad s$^{-1}$.</p>

					<p>We report here a study of various solar activity phenomena occurring in both north and south hemispheres of the Sun during solar cycles 8-23. In the study we have used sunspot data for the period 1832—1976, flare index data for the period 1936-1993, H$\alpha$ flare data 1993-1998 and solar active prominences data for the period 1957-1998. Earlier Verma reported long-term cyclic period in N-S asymmetry and also that the N-S asymmetry of solar activity phenomena during solar cycles 21, 22, 23 and 24 will be south dominated and the N-S asymmetry will shift to north hemisphere in solar cycle 25. The present study shows that the N-S asymmetry during solar cycles 22 and 23 are southern dominated as suggested by Verma.</p>

				<title>Solar Filaments as Tracers of Subsurface Processes</title>
				<feature>Session IV – Filaments &amp; Coronal Structures</feature>
				<page>0177-0183</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solar filaments are discussed in terms of two contrasting paradigms. The standard paradigm is that filaments are formed by condensation of coronal plasma into magnetic fields that are twisted or dimpled as a consequence of motions of the fields' sources in the photo-sphere. According to a new paradigm, filaments form in rising, twisted flux ropes and are a necessary intermediate stage in the transfer to interplanetary space of dynamo-generated magnetic flux. It is argued that the accumulation of magnetic helicity in filaments and their coronal surroundings leads to filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections. These ejections relieve the Sun of the flux generated by the dynamo and make way for the flux of the next cycle.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The solar corona - one of the most spectacular celestial shows and yet one of the most challenging puzzles - exhibits a spectrum of structures related to both the quiet Sun and active regions. In spite of dramatic differences in appearance and physical processes, all these structures share a common origin: they are all related to the solar magnetic field. The origin of the field is beneath the turbulent convection zone, where the magnetic field is not a master but a slave, and one can wonder how much the coronal magnetic field "remembers" its dynamo origin. Surprisingly, it does. We will describe several observational phenomena that indicate a close relationship between coronal and sub-photospheric processes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present an analysis of short time-scale intensity variations in the coronal green line as obtained with high time resolution observations. The observed data can be divided into two groups. The first one shows periodic intensity variations with a period of 5 min. the second one does not show any significant intensity variations. We studied the relation between regions of coronal intensity oscillations and the shape of whitelight coronal structures. We found that the coronal green-line oscillations occur mainly in regions where open white-light coronal structures are located.</p>

				<feature>Session IV – Filaments &amp; Coronal Structures</feature>
				<page>0201-0204</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Long-term cyclic variations in the distribution of prominences and intensities of green (530.3 nm) and red (637.4 nm) coronal emission lines over solar cycles 18-23 are presented. Polar prominence branches will reach the poles at different epochs in cycle 23: the north branch at the beginning in 2002 and the south branch a year later (2003), respectively. The local maxima of intensities in the green line show both poleward- and equatorward-migrating branches. The poleward branches will reach the poles around' cycle maxima like prominences, while the equatorward branches show a duration of 18 years and will end in cycle minima (2007). The red corona shows mostly equatorward branches. The possibility that these branches begin to develop at high latitudes in the preceding cycles cannot be excluded.</p>

					<p>Precise measurements of heliographic position of solar filaments were used for determination of the proper motion of solar filaments on the time-scale of days. The filaments have a tendency to make a shaking or waving of the external structure and to make a general movement of whole filament body, coinciding with the transport of the magnetic flux in the photosphere. The velocity scatter of individual measured points is about one order higher than the accuracy of measurements.</p>

					<p>A comparison is made of observational data on the mean magnetic field of the Sun from several observatories (a selection of published information and new measurements). Results of correlation and regression analyses of observations of background magnetic fields at the STOP telescope of the Sayan solar observatory in different spectral lines are also presented. Results obtained furnish an opportunity to obtain more unbiased information about large-scale magnetic fields of the Sun and, in particular, about manifestations of strong (kilogauss) magnetic fields in them.</p>

				<page>0213-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Observations of the strength and spatial distribution of vector magnetic fields in active regions have revealed several fundamental properties of the twist of their magnetic fields. First, the handedness of this twist obeys a hemispheric rule: left-handed in the northern hemisphere, right-handed in the southern. Second, the rule is weak; active regions often disobey it. It is statistically valid only in a large ensemble. Third, the rule itself, and the amplitude of the scatter about the rule, are quantitatively consistent with twisting of fields by turbulence as flux tubes buoy up through the convection zone. Fourth, there is considerable spatial variation of twist within active regions. However, relaxation to a linear force-free state, which has been documented amply in laboratory plasmas, is not observed.</p>

					<p>Solar flares, prominences and CMEs are well known manifestations of solar activity. For many years, qualitative studies were made about the cyclical behaviour of such phenomena. Nowadays, more quantitative studies have been undertaken with the aim to understand the solar cycle dependence of such phenomena as well as peculiar behaviour, such as asymmetries and periodicities, occurring within the solar cycle. Here, we plan to review the more recent research concerning all these topics.</p>

				<page>0233-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The active region NOAA 8032 of April 15, 1997 was observed to evolve rapidly. The GOES X-ray data showed a number of sub-flares and two C-class flares during the 8-9 hours of its evolution. The magnetic evolution of this region is studied to ascertain its role in flare production. Large changes were observed in magnetic field configuration due to the emergence of new magnetic flux regions (EFR). Most of the new emergence occured very close to the existing magnetic regions, which resulted in strong magnetic field gradients in this region. EFR driven reconnection of the field lines and subsequent flux cancellation might be the reason for the continuous occurrence of sub-flares and other related activities.</p>

				<title>On the Possibility of Radio Emission from Quasi-parallel and Quasi-perpendicular Propagation of Shocks</title>
				<feature>Session V – Vector Magnetic Fields, Prominences, CMEs &amp; Flares</feature>
				<page>0259-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A set of 21 solar type II radio bursts observed using Hiraiso radio spectrograph have been analysed to study the direction of propagation of coronal shocks. Α simple analysis is carried out to find the approximate angle between the shock normal and magnetic field by solving the Rankine-Hugoniot MHD relation with assumption of Alfven speed and plasma beta. From this analysis, it is suggested that both quasi-parallel shocks (favourable) and quasi-perpendicular shocks can generate type II bursts depending upon the circumstances of the corona.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A gradient based algorithm which divides arbitrary images into non-overlapping surface filling tiles of opposite polarity is used to study the flux and size distributions of large scale magnetic flux concentrations in solar and heliospheric observatory (SoHO) magnetograms. The mean absolute flux and size of the concentrations at the considered scale is found to be about $1.7 \times 10^{18}$Mx and 5.2Mm for both polarities. The form of the flux distribution is characterized by a skewness of $\alpha_{3} = 4.9$ and a kurtosis of $\alpha_{4}$, = 42.8. The fall in the distribution in the range $6.5 \times 10^{17}$Mx to $5 \times 10^{18}$Mx is described by an exponential fit, in agreement with a model for the sustenance of quiet region flux.</p>

				<page>0275-0282</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At the solar surface the magnetic field is bundled into discrete elements of concentrated flux, often referred to as magnetic flux tubes, which cover only a small fraction of the solar surface. Flux tubes span a whole spectrum of sizes, ranging from sunspots to features well below the best currently obtainable spatial resolution.</p>
					<p>Whereas sunspots have been well studied, our knowledge of the true brightness of small-scale magnetic features is hampered by the insufficient spatial resolution of the observations. A better understanding of the thermal and magnetic properties of these small-scale features, however, is crucial for an understanding of (climate-relevant) long-term solar irradiance variations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We model the dynamical interaction between magnetic flux tubes and granules in the solar photosphere which leads to the excitation of transverse (kink) and longitudinal (sausage) tube waves. The investigation is motivated by the interpretation of network oscillations in terms of flux tube waves. The calculations show that for magnetic field strengths typical of the network, the energy flux in transverse waves is higher than in longitudinal waves by an order of magnitude. But for weaker fields, such as those that might be found in internetwork regions, the energy fluxes in the two modes are comparable. Using observations of footpoint motions, the energy flux in transverse waves is calculated and the implications for chromospheric heating are pointed out.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Simultaneous time series of broad-band images of two active regions close to the disk center were acquired at the maximum (0.80 $\mu$m) and minimum (1.55 $\mu$m) continuum opacities. Dark faculae are detected in images obtained as weighted intensity differences between both wave-length bands. The elements of quiet regions can be clearly distinguished from those of faculae and pores in scatter plots of brightness temperatures. There is a smooth transition between faculae and pores in the scatter plots. These facts are interpreted in terms of the balance between the inhibition of convective energy transport and the lateral radiative heating.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>To identify and understand the underlying physical mechanisms of total solar and UV irradiance variability and to estimate the contribution of various chromospheric features to UV irradiance, detailed analysis of spatially resolved data is required. The various chromospheric features have been segregated and different parameters have been derived from CaII Κ Spectroheliograms of NSO/Sac Peak and Kodaikanal Observatory and compared with UV irradiance flux measured in MgII h and k lines by NOAA 9 satellite. The important results of this detailed analysis of CaII Κ Images of 1992 together with UV irradiance data will be discussed in this paper.</p>

The constraints of conservation of mass, energy, angular momentum, cross-helicity and relative magnetic helicity are imposed. Equilibria corresponding to the energy extrema while conserving these invariants for parallel flows yield three classes of solutions and one of them with an increasing radial density profile, relevant to solar flux tubes is presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We compute the signs of two different current helicity parameters (i.e., $\alpha_{\text{best}}$ and $H_{c}$) for 87 active regions during the rise of cycle 23. The results indicate that 59\%\ of the active regions in the northern hemisphere have negative $\alpha_{\text{best}}$ and 65\%\ in the southern hemisphere have positive. This is consistent with that of the cycle 22. However, the helicity parameter $H_{c}$ shows a weaker opposite hemispheric preference in the new solar cycle. Possible reasons are discussed.</p>

					<p>Horizontal large-scale velocity field describes horizontal displacement of the photospheric magnetic flux in zonal and meridian directions. The flow systems of solar plasma, constructed according to the velocity field, create the large-scale cellular-like patterns with up-flow in the center and the down-flow on the boundaries. Distribution of the large-scale horizontal eddies (with characteristic scale length from 350 to 490 Mm) was found in the broad equatorial zone, limited by $60^{\circ}$ latitude circles on both hemispheres. The zonal averages of the zonal and meridian velocities, and the total horizontal velocity for each Carrington rotation during the activity cycles no. 21 and 22 varies during the 11-yr activity cycle. Plot of RMS values of total horizontal velocity is shifted about 1·6 years before the similarly shaped variation of the magnetic flux.</p>

				<feature>Session VIII – Helioseismology</feature>
				<page>0323-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The inversion of helioseismic modes leads to the sound velocity inside the Sun with a precision of about 0.1 per cent. Comparisons of solar models with the "seismic sun" represent powerful tools to test the physics: depth of the convection zone, equation of state, opacities, element diffusion processes and mixing inside the radiative zone. We now have evidence that microscopic diffusion (element segregation) does occur below the convection zone, leading to a mild helium depletion in the solar outer layers. Meanwhile this process must be slowed down by some macroscopic effect, presumably rotation-induced mixing. The same mixing is also responsible for the observed lithium depletion. On the other hand, the observations of beryllium and helium 3 impose specific constraints on the depth of this mildly mixed zone. Helioseismology also gives information on the internal solar rotation: while differential rotation exists in the convection zone, solid rotation prevails in the radiative zone, and the transition layer (the so-called "tachocline") is very small. These effects are discussed, together with the astrophysical constraints on the solar neutrino fluxes.</p>

					<p>The interior of the Sun is not directly accessible to observations. Nonetheless, it is possible to infer the physical conditions inside the Sun with the help of structure equations governing its equilibrium and with the powerful observational tools provided by the neutrino fluxes and oscillation frequencies. The helioseismic data show that the internal constitution of the Sun can be adequately represented by a standard solar model. It turns out that a cooler solar core is not a viable solution for the measured deficit of neutrino fluxes, and the resolution of the solar neutrino puzzle should be sought in the realm of particle physics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using intermediate degree p-mode frequency data sets for solar cycle 22, we find that the frequency shifts and magnetic activity indicators show a "hysteresis" phenomenon. It is observed that the magnetic indices follow different paths for the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle while for radiative indices, the separation between the paths are well within the error limits.</p>

				<title>Non-Radial Oscillations in an Axisymmetric MHD Incompressible Fluid</title>
				<feature>Session VIII – Helioseismology</feature>
				<page>0361-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well known from Helioseismology that the Sun exhibits oscillations on a global scale, most of which are non-radial in nature. These oscillations help us to get a clear picture of the internal structure of the Sun as has been demonstrated by the theoretical and observational (such as GONG) studies. In this study we formulate the linearised equations of motion for non-radial oscillations by perturbing the MHD equilibrium solution for an axisymmetric incompressible fluid. The fluid motion and the magnetic field are expressed as scalars $U$, $V$, $Ρ$ and $T$, respectively. In deriving the exact solution for the equilibrium state, we neglect the contribution due to meridional circulation. The perturbed quantities $U_{\ast}$, $V_{\ast}$, $Ρ_{\ast}$, $T_{\ast}$ are written in terms of orthogonal polynomials. A special case of the above formulation and its stability is discussed.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of Cyclically Polarity Reversing Solar Magnetic Cycle as a Cosmic Dynamo</title>
				<feature>Session IX – Dynamo Mechanisms </feature>
				<page>0365-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We briefly describe historical development of the concept of solar dynamo mechanism that generates electric current and magnetic field by plasma flows inside the solar convection zone. The dynamo is the driver of the cyclically polarity reversing solar magnetic cycle. The reversal process can easily and visually be understood in terms of magnetic field line stretching and twisting and folding in three-dimensional space by plasma flows of differential rotation and global convection under influence of Coriolis force. This process gives rise to formation of a series of huge magnetic flux tubes that propagate along iso-rotation surfaces inside the convection zone. Each of these flux tubes produces one solar cycle. We discuss general characteristics of any plasma flows that can generate magnetic field and reverse the polarity of the magnetic field in a rotating body in the Universe. We also mention a list of problems which are currently being disputed concerning the solar dynamo mechanism together with observational evidences that are to be constraints as well as verifications of any solar cycle dynamo theories of short and long term behaviors of the Sun, particularly time variations of its magnetic field, plasma flows, and luminosity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This review provides a historical overview of how research in kinematic solar dynamo modeling evolved during the last few decades and assesses the present state of research. The early pioneering papers assumed the dynamo to operate in the convection zone. It was suggested in the 1980s that the dynamo operates in a thin layer at the bottom of the convection zone. Some researchers in recent years are arguing that the poloidal field is produced near the surface—an idea that goes back to Babcock (1961) and Leighton (1969).</p>

				<page>0423-0429</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The cyclic evolution of the heliospheric plasma parameters is related to the time-dependent boundary conditions in the solar corona. "Minimal" coronal configurations correspond to the regular appearance of the tenuous, but hot and fast plasma streams from the large polar coronal holes. The denser, but cooler and slower solar wind is adjacent to coronal streamers. Irregular dynamic manifestations are present in the corona and the solar wind everywhere and always. They follow the solar activity cycle rather well. Because of this, the direct and indirect solar wind measurements demonstrate clear variations in space and time according to the minimal, intermediate and maximal conditions of the cycles. The average solar wind density, velocity and temperature measured at the Earth's orbit show specific decadal variations and trends, which are of the order of the first tens per cent during the last three solar cycles. Statistical, spectral and correlation characteristics of the solar wind are reviewed with the emphasis on the cycles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The heliosphere is the region filled with magnetized plasma of mainly solar origin. It extends from the solar corona to well beyond the planets, and is separated from the interstellar medium by the heliopause. The latter is embedded in a complex and still unexplored boundary region. The characteristics of heliospheric plasma, fields, and energetic particles depend on highly variable internal boundary conditions, and also on quasi-stationary external ones. Both galactic cosmic rays and energetic particles of solar and heliospheric origin are subject to intensity variations over individual solar cycles and also from cycle to cycle. Particle propagation is controlled by spatially and temporally varying interplanetary magnetic fields, frozen into the solar wind. An overview is presented of the main heliospheric components and processes, and also of the relevant missions and data sets. Particular attention is given to flux variations over the last few solar cycles, and to extrapolated effects on the terrestrial environment.</p>

				<title>Remote Sensing of the Heliospheric Solar Wind using Radio Astronomy Methods and Numerical Simulations</title>
				<feature>Session XI – Solar Wind &amp; Interplanetary Magnetic Fields</feature>
				<page>0439-0444</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ground-based radio astronomy method of interplanetary scintillations (IPS) and spacecraft observations have shown, in the past 25 years, that while coronal holes give rise to stable, recurring high speed solar wind streams during the minimum of the solar activity cycle, the slow speed wind seen more during the solar maximum activity is better associated with the closed field regions, which also give rise to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME's). The latter events increase significantly, as the cycle maximum takes place. We have recently shown that in the case of energetic flares one may be able to track the associated disturbances almost on a one to one basis from a distance of 0.2 to 1 AU using IPS methods. Time dependent 3D MHD models which are constrained by IPS observations are being developed. These models are able to simulate general features of the solar-generated disturbances. Advances in this direction may lead to prediction of heliospheric propagation of these disturbances throughout the solar system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Ulysses Unified Radio and Plasma Wave Experiment (URAP) has observed Langmuir, ion-acoustic and associated solar type III radio emissions in the interplanetary medium. Bursts of 50-300 Hz (in the spacecraft frame) electric field signals, corresponding to long-wavelength ion-acoustic waves are often observed coincident in time with the most intense Langmuir wave spikes, providing evidence for the electrostatic decay instability. Langmuir waves often occur as envelope solitons, suggesting that strong turbulence processes, such as modulational instability and soliton formation, often coexist with weak turbulence processes, such as electrostatic decay, in a few type III burst source regions.</p>

					<p>This summary lecture makes no attempt to summarize what was actually said at the meeting, since this is well covered by the other contributors. Instead I have structured my presentation in three parts: First I try to demonstrate why the Sun is unique by comparing it with laboratory plasmas. This is followed by some personal reminiscences that go back a significant fraction of the century. I conclude in the form of a poem about this memorable conference in honor of the centennial anniversary of the Kodaikanal Observatory.</p>

				<title>Hard X-ray Spectrum of Mkn 421 during the Active Phase</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0145-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spectral measurement of Mkn 421 were made in the hard X-ray energy band of 20–200 keV using a high sensitivity, large area scintillation counter telescope on November 21, 2000 and these coincided with the onset of an active X-ray phase as seen in the ASM counting rates on board RXTE. The observed spectrum can not be fitted to a single power law similar to the PDS data of BeppoSAX. The data can be fitted both by a two component power-law function or a combination of an exponential function with a power law component at the high energies above 80 keV. We identify these components with those arising from the synchrotron self compton and the high energy power-law tail arising from the upgrading of the thermal photons due to multiple Compton scattering a la Cyg X-1. A comparison with the earlier data clearly suggests a spectral variability in the hard X-ray spectrum of the source. We propose a continuously flaring geometry for the source as the underlying mechanism for energy release.</p>

				<page>0155-0172</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present broad band $R$ and narrow band H$\alpha$ emission line images of a sample of optically selected starburst galaxies from the Markarian lists. The emission line morphology is studied and global properties like luminosities, equivalent widths and star formation rates are derived. The radial distribution of H$\alpha$ flux and the EW are determined using concentric aperture photometry on the emission line and the continuum images. H$\alpha$ flux is generally found to peak in the nuclear region and fall off outwards. The EW is found to peak off-center in most of the cases implying that though the intensity of emission is maximum at the nucleus, the star formation activity relative to the underlying continuum often peaks away from the center in Markarian starburst galaxies.</p>

				<page>0173-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three Galactic star forming regions associated with W3(OH), S209 and S187 have been simultaneously mapped in two trans-IRAS far infrared (FIR) bands centered at $\sim 140$ and 200$\mu$m using the TIFR 100 cm balloon borne FIR telescope. These maps showextended FIR emission with structures. The HIRES processed IRAS maps of these regions at 12, 25, 60 &amp; 100 $\mu$m have also been presented for comparison. Point-like sources have been extracted from the longest waveband TIFR maps and searched for associations in the other five bands. The diffuse emission from these regions have been quantified, which turns out to be a significant fraction of the total emission. The spatial distribution of cold dust (T $\lt$ 30 K) for two of these sources (W3(OH) &amp; S209), has been determined reliably from the maps in TIFR bands. The dust temperature and optical depth maps show complex morphology. In general the dust around S209 has been found to be warmer than that in W3(OH) region.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The four stars treated in this paper have been under observation with photoelectric radial-velocity spectrometers for many years. They have proved to be binaries with periods of 30, 1828, 1514 and 822 days respectively; the orbits are of modest eccentricity apart from that of HD 110743 which is indistinguishable from a circle. The mass functions are small, and no companion has been observed for any of the stars. HD 110743, a K dwarf, is much the nearest of the four, and its orbit is of short enough period for the photocentric motion to have been recognized by <i>Hipparcos</i>. An eleventh-magnitude star rather more than $1'$ away from HD 106104 is shown to be a genuine physical companion, with practically identical radial velocity, proper motion and distance modulus, although the projected separation is about 13,000 AU.</p>

				<title>Detection, Excision and Statistics of Interference at the Mauritius Radio Telescope</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0213-0227</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A technique to detect man-made interference in the visibility data of the Mauritius Radio Telescope (MRT) has been developed. This technique is based on the understanding that the interference is generally ‘spiky’ in nature and has Fourier components beyond the maximum frequency which can arise from the radio sky and can therefore be identified. We take the sum of magnitudes of visibilities on all the baselines measured at a given time to improve detectability. This is then high-pass filtered to get a time series from which the contribution of the sky is removed. Interference is detected in the high-pass data using an iterative scheme. In each iteration, interference with amplitudes beyond a certain threshold is detected. These points are then removed from the original time series and the resulting data are high-pass filtered and the process repeated. We have also studied the statistics of the strength, numbers, time of occurrence and duration of the interference at the MRT. The statistics indicate that most often the interference excision can be carried out while post-integrating the visibilities by giving a zero weight to the interference points.</p>

				<title>Variability of Extragalactic Objects in Relation to Redshift, Color, Radio Spectral Index and Absorption Lines</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0263-0282</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optical variability of extragalactic objects, viz., QSOs, BL Lacs and Seyfert galaxies has been monitored systematically over an appreciable period of time and a large amount of data have accumulated. The present work reports results of investigations involving statistical analysis of updated data on relationships between variability and various observed properties of the objects, viz., redshift, color indices, radio spectral index and absorption lines. It is found that at high frequencies (rest frame) radio spectral index does not change significantly with the degree of variability. However, the degree of variability depends on redshifts. On the other hand, presence or absence of absorption lines is significantly associated with variability for QSOs with larger redshifts ($z \gt 1.0$), while no such relationship exists for QSOs at smaller redshifts ($z \lt 1.0$ or other objects. Correlation between color indices and redshifts depends on the degree of variability and the sample chosen for the color index.</p>

					<p>We present the results from ROSAT observations of 3C273 in the soft X-ray band. The light variation of 3C273 was investigated for three different energy bands of soft, medium, and hard. The maximum variability with a factor of 2 for 551 dayswas confirmed at all three different bands. This appears to be a periodic variation within the period of roughly 6 months. However, the short-term or micro variation was not so distinct and the light variation of each band did not show any correlation between them. The hardness ratio for hard and soft bands shows irregular variation but there was no correlation between them. There is no distinct variation of the photon index in the case of simple power law model fitting. For power law + free absorption model fitting, the average photon index $(\Gamma)$ is 2.08.</p>

				<title>HI Fluctuations at Large Redshifts: I–Visibility correlation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0293-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the possibility of probing the large scale structure in the universe at large redshifts by studying fluctuations in the redshifted 1420 MHz emission from the neutral hydrogen (HI) at early epochs. The neutral hydrogen content of the universe is knownfrom absorption studies for $z \lesssim 4.5$. The HI distribution is expected to be inhomogeneous in the gravitational instability picture and this inhomogeneity leads to anisotropy in the redshifted HI emission. The best hope of detecting this anisotropy is by using a large low-frequency interferometric instrument like the Giant Meter-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We calculate the visibility correlation function $\langle V_{v}(\mathbf{U})V_{v'}(\mathbf{U})\rangle$ at two frequencies $v$ and $v'$ of the redshifted HI emission for an interferometric observation. In particular we give numerical results for the two GMRT channels centered around $v=325$ MHz and $v=610$ MHz from density inhomogeneity and peculiar velocity of the HI distribution. The visibility correlation is $\simeq 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ Jy$^{2}$. We calculate the signal-to-noise for detecting the correlation signal in the presence of system noise and show that the GMRT might detect the signal for integration times $\simeq 100$ hrs. We argue that the measurement of visibility correlation allows optimal use of the uncorrelated nature of the system noise across baselines and frequency channels.</p>

				<title>A Map for a Group of Resonant Cases in a Quartic Galactic Hamiltonian</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0309-0319</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a map for the study of resonant motion in a potential made up of two harmonic oscillators with quartic perturbing terms. This potential can be considered to describe motion in the central parts of non-rotating elliptical galaxies. The map is based on the averaged Hamiltonian. Adding on a semi-empirical basis suitable terms in the unperturbed averaged Hamiltonian, corresponding to the $1:1$ resonant case, we are able to construct a map describing motion in several resonant cases. The map is used in order to find the $x- p_{x}$ Poincare phase plane for each resonance. Comparing the results of the map, with those obtained by numerical integration of the equation of motion, we observe, that the map describes satisfactorily the broad features of orbits in all studied cases for regular motion. There are cases where the map describes satisfactorily the properties of the chaotic orbits as well.</p>

				<title>Real-Time Signal Processor for Pulsar Studies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0321-0342</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the design, tests and preliminary results of a real-time parallel signal processor built to aid a wide variety of pulsar observations. The signal processor reduces the distortions caused by the effects of dispersion, Faraday rotation, doppler acceleration and parallactic angle variations, at a sustained data rate of 32 Msamples/sec. It also folds the pulses coherently over the period and integrates adjacent samples in time and frequency to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting data are recorded for further off-line analysis of the characteristics of pulsars and the intervening medium. The signal processing for analysis of pulsar signals is quite complex, imposing the need for a high computational throughput, typically of the order of a Giga operations per second (GOPS). Conventionally, the high computational demand restricts the flexibility to handle only a few types of pulsar observations. This instrument is designed to handle a wide variety of Pulsar observations with the Giant Metre Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT), and is flexible enough to be used in many other high-speed, signal processing applications. The technology used includes field-programmable-gate-array(FPGA) based data/code routing interfaces, PC-AT based control, diagnostics and data acquisition, digital signal processor (DSP) chip based parallel processing nodes and C language based control software and DSP-assembly programs for signal processing. The architecture and the software implementation of the parallel processor are fine-tuned to realize about 60 MOPS per DSP node and a multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) capability.</p>

				<title>Seismic View of the Solar Interior</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interior of the Sun is not directly observable to us. Nevertheless, it is possible to infer the physical conditions prevailing in the solar interior with the help of theoretical models coupled with observational input provided by measured frequencies of solar oscillations. The frequencies of these solar oscillations depend on the internal structure and dynamics of the Sun and from the knowledge of these frequencies it is possible to infer the internal structure as well as the large scale flows inside the Sun, in the same way as the observations of seismic waves on the surface of Earth help us in the study of its interior. With the accumulation of seismic data over the last six years it has also become possible to study temporal variations in the solar interior. Some of these seismic inferences would be described.</p>

				<title>Photometric Variability of Four Coronally Active Stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0009-0014</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present photometric observations of four stars that are optical counterparts of soft X-ray/EUV sources, namely 1ES 0829+15.9, 1ES0920-13.6, 2RE J110159+223509 and 1ES 1737+61.2. We have discovered periodic variability in two of the stars, viz., MCC 527 (1ES 0829+15.9; Period = 0$^{d}$.828 $\pm$ 0.0047) and HD 81032 (1ES 0920-13.6; Period = $\sim 57.02 \pm 0.560$ days). HD 95559 (2RE J110159+223509) is found to show a period of 3$^{d}$. HD 160934 (1ES1737+61.2) also shows photometric variability but needs to be monitored further for finding its period. These stars most likely belong to the class of chromospherically active stars.</p>

				<title>The Investigation of Nova-like Variable MV Lyr during the 1999–2001 Years</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0015-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A peculiar nova-like MV Lyr was investigated. The CCD-observations ofMVLyr were continued in Crimea during the outbursts and quiescent states. Last year its behavior became non-typical for “anti-dwarf novae”. The length of its first deep minimum was 10 years. A modern state is characterized by very strong outbursts and very often changes of the stages. The periods 0.$^{d}$d128 and 0.$^{d}$d136 were obtained for 1998 and 1999 years accordingly. Possibly, a relation between the photometric period and the brightness exists.</p>

				<title>High Energy Phenomena in Eta Carinae</title>

				<page>0019-0022</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated with BeppoSAX the long term behaviour of the harder X-ray component of the supposed supermassive binary system $\eta$ Car along its 5.52 year cycle. We have found that in March 1998 during egress from the last December 1997 eclipse, this component was the same as outside eclipse, but for a large $(\times 3.5)$ increase of NH$_{h}$, that can be attributed to the presence or formation of opaque matter in front of the source near periastron. Unexpectedly, at that time the iron 6.7 keV emission line was 40\%\ stronger. BeppoSAX has for the first time found a <i>hard X-ray tail</i> extending to at least 50 keV, that cannot be adequately fitted with an additional hotter thermal component. The 2–100 keV spectrum of $\eta$ Car is instead well fitted with an absorbed powerlaw spectrum with photon index 2.53, suggesting non-thermal emission as an alternative model for the core source.</p>

				<title>Upper Limits on O VI Emission from Voyager Observations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0023-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have examined 426 <i>Voyager</i> fields distributed across the sky for O VI ($\gamma\gamma$ 1032/1038 Å) emission from the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium. No such emission was detected in any of our observed fields. Our most constraining limit was a 90\%\ confidence upper limit of 2600 photons cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ on the doublet emission in the direction (l, b) = (117.3, 50.6). Combining this with an absorption line measurement in nearly the same direction allows us to place an upper limit of 0.01 cm$^{-3}$ on the electron density of the hot gas in this direction. We have placed 90\%\ confidence upper limits of less than or equal to 10,000 photons cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ on the O VI emission in 16 of our 426 observations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present spectral variations of the binary X-ray pulsar LMC X-4 observed with the RXTE/PCA during different phases of its 30.5 day long third period. Only out-of-eclipse data were used for this study. The 3–25 keV spectrum, modeled with high energy cut-off power-law and iron line emission is found to show strong dependence on the intensity state. Correlations between the Fe line emission flux and different parameters of the continuum are presented here.</p>

					<p>We report the discovery of a decay in the superorbital period of the binary X-ray pulsar LMC X-4. Combining archival data and published long term X-ray light curves, we have found a decay in the third period in this system ($P \sim 30.3$ day, $\dot{P}\sim -2\times 10^{-5}$ s s$^{-1}$). Along with this result, a comparison of the superorbital intensity variations in LMC X-4, Her X-1 and SMC X-1 is also presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The field of Very High Energy (VHE) gamma ray astronomy using the Atmospheric Cerenkov Technique has entered an interesting phase with detection of various galactic and extragalactic sources. Among galactic sources, only the Crab nebula has been established as a standard candle. Most observations on pulsars are in agreement as to the necessity for the GeV spectra to steepen at $\lt$ 200 GeV. While the Imaging method for increase of sensitivity has been successful with many results, an alternate technique – <i>Wavefront Sampling Technique</i> – is also being used by an increasing number of experiments. The recently commissioned experiment at Pachmarhi (PACT) in India is presented as an example of this technique. Preliminary results from this experiment show detection of VHE $\gamma$-ray emission from</p>

					<p>The on-going Parkes multibeam survey has been astoundingly successful (Manchester <i>et al.</i> 2001), and its discovery of over 600 pulsars has opened up new avenues for probing the Galaxy’s electron content and magnetic field. Here we report on recent observations made with the Arecibo 305-m telescope, where 80 distant, high dispersion measure pulsars (of which 35 are from the multibeam survey) were studied at multiple frequency bands in the range 0.4–2.4 GHz, in order to determine their scattering properties, rotation measures and spectral indices. The results will be used to meet a variety of science goals; viz., creating an improved model of the electron density, mapping out the Galactic magnetic field, and modeling the pulsar population.</p>

					<p>Several new features of X-ray binary pulsars are revealed from recent observations with ASCA, RXTE, BeppoSAX and other X-ray observatories. Among these, I will review in this paper some recent progress in spectroscopic studies of accreting X-ray pulsars in binary systems (XBPs). First, I will discuss soft excess features observed in the energy spectra of XBPs and propose that it is a common feature for various subclasses of XBPs. Next I will present some recent results of high resolution spectroscopy with ASCA and Chandra.</p>

					<p>This paper reviews the current status of the theoretical models of the evolution of the magnetic fields of neutron stars other than magnetars. It appears that the magnetic fields of neutron stars decay significantly only if they are in binary systems. Three major physical models for this, namely spindown-induced flux expulsion, ohmic evolution of crustal field and diamagnetic screening of the field by accreted plasma, are reviewed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The GRB monitor (GRBM) on board the Indian SROSS C-2 satellite has detected 53 classical gamma ray bursts since its launch in May, 1994 till its re-entry in July, 2001. For a subset of 26 events, locations were obtained from simultaneous observations by other gamma-ray detectors in space. The sky distribution of these 26 SROSS C-2 bursts is consistent with isotropy. The distribution of event durations shows evidence for bimodality. There is an evidence for a moderate hardness ratio-intensity (HIC) correlation in the data. The SROSS C-2 GRBM has also detected three episodes of emission from the SGR 1627-41.</p>

Multicolor X-ray imaging reveals new details of the outer shock and ejecta. At energies between 4 and 6 keV, the outline of the outer shock is clearly revealed in X-rays for the first time. The distribution of the emission from lines of Si and Fe are confirmed to have a different morphology from each other, and the Si ejecta are shown to extend to the blast shock at several locations. Characteristic spectra of the outer shock and ejecta are also presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study the possibility of quasar outflows in clusters and groups of galaxies heating the intracluster gas in order to explain the recent observation of excess entropy in this gas. We show that radio galaxies alone cannot provide the energy required to explain the observations but the inclusion of Broad Absorption Line (BAL) outflows can do so, and that in this scenario most of the heating takes place at $z\sim$ 1–4, the “preheating” epoch being at a lower redshift for lower mass clusters.</p>

				<title>CLASS B 1359 + 154: Modelling Lensing by a Group of Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0115-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The recently discovered gravitationally lensed system CLASS B1359+154 appears to have six detectable images of a single background source at a redshift of 3.235. A group of galaxies acts as the lens, at a redshift of $\sim 1$. The present work identifies two distinct, physically plausible image configurations, a 7-image one and a 9-image one. Mass models are constructed corresponding to realizations of these two configurations. Both models call for, in addition to non-singular galaxy-type lenses, a larger scale mass component that resembles the extended dark matter distributions seen in relatively low-redshift galaxy groups. It is presently observationally impossible to study the extended X-ray emission from a group at such a high redshift, hence lensing studies are of some interest. A lensed system with a high image multiplicity does not necessarily admit of a unique lensing interpretation; discrimination is possible with additional observable details (e.g., the image parities, which are uncommon among even the simpler systems).</p>

					<p>We have obtained $K$-band imaging observations of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) host galaxies with the near-infrared spectro-imager ISAAC installed on the Very Large Telescope at Paranal (Chile). The derived $K$ magnitudes, combined with other photometric data taken from the literature, are used to investigate the $R$–$K$ colors of GRB hosts. We do not find any extremely reddened starbursts in our sample, despite the capability of GRBs to trace star formation even in dusty regions. The observed $R$–$K$ colors are on the contrary typical of irregular and spiral blue galaxies at high redshift.</p>

					<p>This talk focuses on the various aspects we learnt from multiband observations of GRBs both, before and during the afterglow era. A statistical analysis to estimate the probable redshifts of host galaxies using the luminosity function of GRBs compatible with both the afterglow redshift data as well as the overall population of GRBs is discussed. We then address the question whether the observed fields of GRBs with precise localizations from third Inter-Planetary Network (IPN$^{3}$) contain suitable candidates for their host galaxies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Matter accreting onto black holes suffers a standing or oscillating shock wave in much of the parameter space. The post-shock region is hot, puffed up and reprocesses soft photons from a Keplerian disc to produce the characteristic hard tail of the spectrum of accretion discs. The post-shock torus is also the base of the bipolar jets. We study the interaction of these jets with the hard photons emitted from the disc. We show that radiative force can accelerate outflows but the drag can limit the terminal speed. We introduce an equilibrium speed $v_{eq}$ as a function of distance, above which the flow will experience radiative deceleration.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The structures of faint high redshift galaxies cannot be observed directly. But if a luminous quasar is located farther along their line of sight, high resolution absorption lines offer a valuable and reliable probe to their structure. GMRT is suited to monitor the absorption spectra, if the redshifted neutral hydrogen or OH doublet fall in one of the windows of the telescope. We present the OH doublet absorption spectra for the system B0218+357, taken at GMRT this year at resolution of approx. 9.5 km/sec with an rms noise of the order of 1 mJy. Based on our study of the OH doublet and 21cm neutral hydrogen line we infer that, in the lensing spiral galaxy of B0218+57, neutral hydrogen and OH coexist in tenous clouds and there is possibly a hole in the central part of the galaxy. In contrast, the gas is seen in high density clouds in the lens in an otherwise similar system PKS1830-211.</p>

					<p>We present connections between global and local parameters in a realistic dynamical model, describing motion in a barred galaxy. Expanding the global model in the vicinity of a stable Lagrange point, we find the potential of a two-dimensional perturbed harmonic oscillator, which describes local motion near the centre of the global model. The frequencies of oscillations and the coefficients of the perturbing terms are not arbitrary but are connected to the mass, the angular rotation velocity, the scale length and the strength of the galactic bar. The local energy is also connected to the global energy. A comparison of the properties of orbits in the global and local potential is also made.</p>

It combines the automatic inclusion of periodic boundary conditions of PM simulations with the high resolution of tree codes. This is done by splitting the gravitational force into a short range and a long range component.

				<title>Spectral Measurements of Cyg X-3: A Thermal Source Embedded in Hot Plasma within a Cold Shell</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0197-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The attempts at unified model fitting to explain the spectral variations in Cyg X-3 suggest equally probable fits with a combination of an absorbed blackbody and a separately absorbed power law with an exponential cut-off or a composite of absorbed free-free emission with a power law hard X-ray component apart from the iron emission line. These seemingly ordinary but ad hoc mixtures of simple X-ray emission mechanisms have a profound implication about the geometry of the X-ray source. While the first set suggests a black-hole nature of the compact object, the second combination is consistent with a neutron star binary picture. The spectral variability at hard X-ray energies above 30 keV can provide crucial input for the unified picture. In this paper, we present spectral observations of Cyg X-3, made in our on-going survey of galactic and extragalactic X-ray sources in the 20–200 keV energy region, using Large Area Scintillation counter Experiment. The data show a clear power-law photon spectrum of the form $\frac{{\rm d}N}{{\rm d}E}\sim E^{-2.8}$ in the 20 to 130 keVenergy range. Acomparison with earlier data suggests that the total number of X-ray photons in the entire 2–500 keV energy band is conserved at all time for a given luminosity level irrespective of the state. We propose that this behaviour can be explained by a simple geometry in which a thermal X-ray source is embedded in a hot plasma formed by winds from the accretion disk within a cold shell. The high/soft and low/hard X-ray states of the source are simply the manifestation of the extent of the surrounding scattering medium in which the seed photons are Comptonized and hot plasma can be maintained by either the X-ray driven winds or the magneto-centrifugal winds.</p>

				<title>Fast Transition between High-soft and Low-soft States in GRS 1915 + 105: Evidence for a Critically Viscous Accretion Flow</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0213-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results of a detailed analysis of RXTE observations of class $\omega$ (Klein-Wolt <i>et al.</i> 2002) which show an unusual state transition between high-soft and low-soft states in the Galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105. Out of about 600 pointed RXTE observations, the source was found to exhibit such state transition only on 16 occasions. An examination of the RXTE/ASM data in conjunction with the pointed observations reveals that these events appeared as a series of quasi-regular dips in two stretches of long duration (about 20 days during each occasion) when hard X-ray and radio flux were very low. The X-ray light curve and colour-colour diagram of the source during these observations are found to be different from any reported so far. The duration of these dips is found to be of the order of a few tens of seconds with a repetition time of a few hundred seconds. The transition between these dips and non-dips which differ in intensity by a factor of $\sim 3.5$, is observed to be very fast ($\sim$ a few seconds). It is observed that the low-frequency narrow QPOs are absent in the power density spectrum (PDS) of the dip and non-dip regions of class $\omega$ and the PDS is a power law in the 0.1 – 10 Hz frequency range. There is a remarkable similarity in the spectral and timing properties of the source during the dip and non-dip regions in this set of observations. These properties of the source are distinctly different from those seen in the observations of other classes. This indicates that the basic accretion disk structure during both dip and non-dip regions of class $\omega$ is similar, but differ only in intensity. To explain these observations, we invoke a model in which the viscosity is very close to critical viscosity and the shock wave is weak or absent.</p>

				<title>On the Relativistic Beaming and Orientation Effects in Core-Dominated Quasars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0235-0242</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we investigate the relativistic beaming effects in a well-defined sample of core-dominated quasars using the correlation between the relative prominence of the core with respect to the extended emission (defined as the ratio of core- to lobe- flux density measured in the rest frame of the source) and the projected linear size as an indicator of relativistic beaming and source orientation. Based on the orientation-dependent relativistic beaming and unification paradigm for high luminosity sources in which the Fanaroff-Riley class-II radio galaxies form the unbeamed parent population of both the lobe- and core-dominated quasars which are expected to lie at successively smaller angles to the line of sight, we find that the flows in the cores of these core-dominated quasars are highly relativistic, with optimum bulk Lorentz factor, $\gamma_{opt}\sim 6$&#8212;16, and also highly anisotropic, with an average viewing angle, $\sim 9^{\circ}-16^{\circ}$. Furthermore, the largest boosting occurs within a critical cone angle of $\approx 4^{\circ}-10^{\circ}$.</p>

				<title>Spectral Variability in Hard X-rays and the Evidence for a 13.5 Years Period in the Bright Quasar 3C273</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0243-0258</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the observation of nearest quasar 3C273 made with LASE instrument on November 20th, 1998 as a part of our continuing programme of balloon borne hard X-ray observations in the 20–200 keV band using high sensitivity Large Area Scintillation counter Experiment. Our data clearly show a steep spectrum in the 20–200 keV with power law spectral index $\alpha = 226\pm 0.07$. This is in complete contrast to the reported data from OSSE and BeppoSAX which suggest the value of 1.3 to 1.6 for the power law index in the X-ray energy band, but is quite consistent with the value derived for the high energy gamma ray data. A single power law fit in the X-ray and gamma ray energy bands points to a common origin of these photons and the absence of spectral break around 1 MeV as suggested in literature. We have reanalyzed the available data to study the temporal variability of the spectrum in the hard X-ray band. Our analysis reveals that 50 keV flux from the source, shows a strong modulation with a period of about 13.5 years. The analysis of the optical light curve of the source also supports the 5000 day period.We discuss the emission mechanism and the possible sites for X-ray photons along with the implications of the long term periodicity with respect to source geometry.</p>

				<title>The Hubble Relation for a Comprehensive Sample of QSOs</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0011-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A correlation between redshifts $(z)$ and apparent magnitudes $(V)$ (Hubble relation) of Quasi Stellar Objects (QSOs) has long been sought. Such a correlation exists for galaxies whose redshifts are of cosmological origin. However, a plot of the two quantities representing the Hubble diagram for QSOs exhibits, in general, a wild scatter. This raises the question whether redshifts of QSOs are cosmological. On the other hand, most luminous QSOs in groups, and subsamples with particular properties, have been reported to show the Hubble relation. In the present paper, we analyse all optically non-variable QSOs in a comprehensive sample. In our analysis we grouped the objects into certain intervals of apparent magnitudes. Correlations obtained between redshifts and magnitudes are all statistically robust. Also, the Hubble relation in the usual form $V=5\log z+C$ is obeyed very convincingly for QSOs with $V\lt 19.5$.</p>

				<title>HI Fluctuations at Large Redshifts: II – the Signal Expected for the GMRT</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0023-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For the GMRT, we calculate the expected signal from redshifted HI emission at two frequency bands centered at 610 and 325MHz. The study focuses on the visibility-visibility cross-correlations, proposed earlier as the optimal statistical estimator for detecting and analyzing this signal. These correlations directly probe the power spectrum of density fluctuations at the redshift where the radiation originated, and thereby provide a method for studying the large scale structures at large redshifts. We present detailed estimates of the correlations expected between the visibilities measured at different baselines and frequencies. Analytic fitting formulas representing the salient features of the expected signal are also provided. These will be useful in planning observations and deciding an optimal strategy for detecting this signal.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0043</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the GMRT detection of associated HI 21 cm-line absorption in the $z = 1.1946$ red quasar 3C 190. Most of the absorption is blue-shifted with respect to the systemic redshift. The absorption, at $\sim 647.7$MHz, is broad and complex, spanning a velocity width of $\sim 600$ kms$^{-1}$. Since the core is self-absorbed at this frequency, the absorption is most likely towards the hotspots. Comparison of the radio and deep optical images reveal linear filaments in the optical which overlap with the brighter radio jet towards the south-west.We therefore suggest that most of the HI 21 cm-line absorption could be occurring in the atomic gas shocked by the south-west jet.</p>

				<title>Large Scale Magnetic Fields: Density Power Spectrum in Redshift Space</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0051-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We compute the density redshift-space power spectrum in the presence of tangled magnetic fields and compare it with existing observations. Our analysis shows that if these magnetic fields originated in the early universe then it is possible to construct models for which the shape of the power spectrum agrees with the large scale slope of the observed power spectrum. However requiring compatibility with observed CMBR anisotropies, the normalization of the power spectrum is too low for magnetic fields to have significant impact on the large scale structure at present. Magnetic fields of a more recent origin generically give density power spectrum $\propto k^{4}$ which doesn’t agree with the shape of the observed power spectrum at any scale. Magnetic fields generate curl modes of the velocity field which increase both the quadrupole and hexadecapole of the redshift space power spectrum. For curl modes, the hexadecapole dominates over quadrupole. So the presence of curl modes could be indicated by an anomalously large hexadecapole, which has not yet been computed from observation.</p>
					<p>It appears difficult to construct models in which tangled magnetic fields could have played a major role in shaping the large scale structure in the present epoch. However if they did, one of the best ways to infer their presence would be from the redshift space effects in the density power spectrum.</p>

				<title>Studies of Clump Structure of Photodissociation Regions at Millimeter and Sub-millimeterWavelengths</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0069-0083</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To interpret the millimeter and sub-millimeter line emissions of atomic and molecular species from galactic and extragalactic photodissociation regions, warm gas components and molecular clouds, generally, escape probability formalism of Tielens &amp; Hollenbach (herein referred as TH) are employed which is based on the assumption of plane parallel geometry of infinite slab allowing photons to escape only from the front. Contrary to the assumption observationally it is found that these lines are optically thin except OI(63$\mu$m) and low rotational transitions of CO and some other molecules. This observational evidence led us to assume that emitting regions are finite parallel plane slab in which photons are allowed to escape from both the surfaces (back and front). Therefore, in the present study escape of radiations from both sides of the homogeneous and also clumpy PDR/molecular clouds are taken into consideration for calculating the line intensities at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths (hereinafter referred as QA). Results are compared with that of the TH model. It is found that thermal and chemical structures of the regions are almost similar in both the formalisms. But line intensities are modified by differing factors. Particularly at lowdensity and lowkinetic temperature and also for optically thin lines line intensities calculated from TH and QA model differ substantially. But at density higher than the critical density and also for optically thick lines TH and QA models converge to almost same values. An attempt has been made to study the physical conditions of the M17 region employing the present formalism.</p>

					<p>We obtain the $x - p_{x}$ Poincare phase plane for a two dimensional, resonant, galactic type Hamiltonian using conventional numerical integration, a second order symplectic integrator and a map based on the averaged Hamiltonian. It is found that all three methods give good results, for small values of the perturbation parameter, while the symplectic integrator does a better job than the mapping, for large perturbations. The dynamical spectra are used to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion.</p>

				<page>0099-0109</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A research that we conducted in 1963 on the evolution of the binaries based on the available orbital data to obtain a philosophical degree, led to the establishment of an interesting and new diagram between the logarithm of the total mass and a particular parameter $X$, bound to the areal constant. This appeared to have a real physical significance but the basic observational material was insufficiently extended to assure its undeniable existence. In 1981, a new research based on a more extended orbital material, has confirmed this diagram. Presently, another important increase in the orbital material and the availability of highly accurate trigonometric parallaxes produced by the Hipparcos satellite, gave us the opportunity to confirm once more the stability of this diagram. This last research is here described.</p>

				<title>Optical Variability Properties of High Luminosity AGN Classes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results of a comparative study of the intra-night optical variability (INOV) characteristics of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, which involves a systematic intra-night optical monitoring of seven sets of high luminosity AGNs covering the redshift range $z\simeq 0.2$ to $z\simeq 2.2$. The sample, matched in the optical luminosity – redshift $(M_{B}-z)$ plane, consists of seven radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), eight radio lobe-dominated quasars (LDQs), five radio core-dominated quasars (CDQs) and six BL Lac objects (BLs). Systematic CCD observations, aided by a careful data analysis procedure, have allowed us to detect INOV with amplitudes as low as about 1\%\. Present observations cover a total of 113 nights (720 hours) with only a single qusar monitored as continuously as possible on a given night. Considering the cases of only unambiguous detections of INOV we have estimated duty cycles (DCs) of 17\%, 12\%, 20\%\ and 61\%\ for RQQs, LDQs, CDQs, and BLs, respectively. The much lower amplitude and DC of INOV shown by RQQs compared to BLs may be understood in terms of their having optical synchrotron jets which are modestly misdirected from us. From our fairly extensive dataset, no general trend of a correlation between the INOVamplitude and the apparent optical brightness of the quasar is noticed. This suggests that the physical mechanisms of INOV and long term optical variability (LTOV) do not have a one-to-one relationship and different factors are involved. Also, the absence of a clear negative correlation between the INOV and LTOV characteristics of blazars of our sample points toward an inconspicuous contribution of accretion disk fluctuations to the observed INOV. The INOV duty cycle of the AGNs observed in this program suggests that INOV is associated predominantly with the highly polarized optical emission components. We also report new VLA imaging of two RQQs (1029 + 329 &amp; 1252 + 020) in our sample which has yielded a 5 GHz detection in one of them (1252 + 020; $S_{5\text{\,GHz}}\simeq 1$ mJy)</p>

A weak broad absorption feature reported by de Bruyn (1996) has not been detected in our observations. We also place an upper limit of 4 mJy $(2\sigma)$ on emission line strength at the position where Uson <i>et al.</i> (1991) claimed to have found a narrow emission line.</p>

				<title>HI Fluctuations at Large Redshifts: III – Simulating the Signal Expected at GMRT</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0067-0080</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We simulate the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) at the redshifts $z = 1.3$ and 3.4 using a cosmological N-body simulation along with a prescription for assigning HI masses to the particles. The HI is distributed in clouds whose properties are consistent with those of the damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption systems (DLAs) seen in quasar spectra. The clustering properties of these clouds are identical to those of the dark matter. We use this to simulate the redshifted HI emission expected at 610 MHz and 325 MHz, two of the observing bands at the GMRT. These are used to predict the correlations expected between the complex visibilities measured at different baselines and frequencies in radio-interferometric observations with the GMRT. The visibility correlations directly probe the power spectrum of HI fluctuations at the epoch when the HI emission originated, and this holds the possibility of using HI observations to study large-scale structures at high $z$.</p>

				<title>Angular Momentum Transport in Quasi-Keplerian Accretion Disks</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0081-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We reexamine arguments advanced by Hayashi &amp; Matsuda (2001), who claim that several simple, physically motivated derivations based on mean free path theory for calculating the viscous torque in a quasi-Keplerian accretion disk yield results that are inconsistent with the generally accepted model. If correct, the ideas proposed by Hayashi &amp; Matsuda would radically alter our understanding of the nature of the angular momentum transport in the disk, which is a central feature of accretion disk theory. However, in this paper we point out several fallacies in their arguments and show that there indeed exists a simple derivation based on mean free path theory that yields an expression for the viscous torque that is proportional to the radial derivative of the angular velocity in the accretion disk, as expected. The derivation is based on the analysis of the epicyclic motion of gas parcels in adjacent eddies in the disk.</p>

					<p>Radial dipole matrix elements having astrophysical importance have been computed for highly excited states of hydrogen atom. Computation is based on Heisenberg’s form of correspondence principle for Coulomb potential. Particular attention has been paid to the choice of classical analogue $(n_{c})$ of principal quantum number $(n)$. The computed radial matrix elements are in good agreement with quantum mechanical results. Further, radial matrix elements for few transitions involving high $n$ neighboring states of hydrogen atom are presented.</p>

					<p>We describe the two-dimensional TreePM method in this paper. The 2d TreePM code is an accurate and efficient technique to carry out large two-dimensional N-body simulations in cosmology. This hybrid code combines the 2d Barnes and Hut Tree method and the 2d Particle–Mesh method. We describe the splitting of force between the PM and the Tree parts. We also estimate error in force for a realistic configuration. Finally, we discuss some tests of the code.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>$\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$-drifting jets have been generally ignored for the past 25 years even though they may well describe all the astrophysical jet sources, both on galactic and stellar scales. Here we present closed-form solutions for their joint field-and-particle distribution, argue that the observed jets are near equipartition, with extremely relativistic, monoenergetic $e^{\pm}$-pairs of bulk Lorentz factor $\gamma  \lesssim 10^{4}$, and are first-order stable. We describe plausible mechanisms for the jets’ (i) formation, (ii) propagation, and (iii) termination. Wherever a beam meets with resistance, its frozen-in Poynting flux transforms the delta-shaped energy distribution of the pairs into an almost white power law, $E^{2}N_{E}\sim E^{-\epsilon}$ with $\epsilon\gtrsim 0$, via single-step falls through the huge convected potential.</p>

				<title>On the Origin of the Wide HI Absorption Line towards Sgr A$^{\ast}$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0129-0141</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have imaged a region of $\sim 5'$ extent surrounding Sgr A$^{\ast}$ in the HI 21 cm-line absorption using the Very Large Array. A Gaussian decomposition of the optical depth spectra at positions within $\sim 2'$ ($\sim 5$ pc at 8.5 kpc) of Sgr A$^{\ast}$ detects a wide line underlying the many narrow absorption lines. The wide line has a mean peak optical depth of 0.32 $\pm$ 0.12 centered at a mean velocity of $V_{\text{lsr}} = -4\pm 15$ km s$^{-1}$. The mean full width at half maximum is 119$\pm$42 km s$^{-1}$. Such a wide line is absent in the spectra at positions beyond $\sim 2'$ from Sgr A$^{\ast}$. The position-velocity diagrams in optical depth reveal that the wide line originates in various components of the circumnuclear disk (radius $\sim 1.3'$) surrounding Sgr A$^{\ast}$. These components contribute to the optical depth of the wide line in different velocity ranges. The position-velocity diagrams do not reveal any diffuse feature which could be attributed to a large number of HI clouds along the line of sight to Sgr A$^{\ast}$. Consequently, the wide line has no implications either to a global population of shocked HI clouds in the Galaxy or to the energetics of the interstellar medium as was earlier thought.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have used the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to measure the Galactic HI 21-cm line absorption towards 102 extragalactic radio continuum sources, located at high $(|b| \gt 15^{\circ})$ Galactic latitudes. The Declination coverage of the present survey is $\delta \grtsim -45^{\circ}$. With a mean rms optical depth of $\sim 0.003$, this is the most sensitive Galactic HI 21-cm line absorption survey to date. To supplement the absorption data, we have extracted the HI 21-cm line emission profiles towards these 102 lines of sight from the Leiden Dwingeloo Survey of Galactic neutral hydrogen. We have carried out a Gaussian fitting analysis to identify the discrete absorption and emission components in these profiles. In this paper, we present the spectra and the components. A subsequent paper will discuss the interpretation of these results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have carried out a sensitive high-latitude $(|b| \gt 15^{\circ})$ HI 21 cm-line absorption survey towards 102 sources using the GMRT. With a $3\sigma$ detection limit in optical depth of $\sim 0.01$, this is the most sensitive HI absorption survey. We detected 126 absorption features most of which also have corresponding HI emission features in the Leiden Dwingeloo Survey of Galactic neutral Hydrogen. The histogram of random velocities of the absorption features is well-fit by two Gaussians centered at $V_{\text{lsr}} \sim 0$ km s$^{−1}$ with velocity dispersions of $7.6 \pm 0.3$ km s$^{-1}$ and $21\pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$ respectively. About 20\%\ of the HI absorption features form the larger velocity dispersion component. The HI absorption features forming the narrow Gaussian have a mean optical depth of $0.20\pm 0.19$, a mean HI column density of $(1.46 \pm 1.03) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a mean spin temperature of $121\pm 69$ K. These HI concentrations can be identified with the standard HI clouds in the cold neutral medium of the Galaxy. The HI absorption features forming the wider Gaussian have a mean optical depth of $0.04\pm 0.02$, a mean HI column density of $(4.3\pm 3.4)\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a mean spin temperature of $125\pm 82$ K. The HI column densities of these fast clouds decrease with their increasing random velocities. These fast clouds can be identified with a population of clouds detected so far only in optical absorption and in HI emission lines with a similar velocity dispersion. This population of fast clouds is likely to be in the lower Galactic Halo.</p>

				<title>An Apparent Descriptive Method for Judging the Synchronization of Rotation of Binary Stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0203-0211</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of the synchronous rotation of binary stars is judged by using a synchronous parameter $Q$ introduced in an apparent descriptive method. The synchronous parameter $Q$ is defined as the ratio of the rotational period to the orbital period. The author suggests several apparent phenomenal descriptive methods for judging the synchronization of rotation of binary stars. The first method is applicable when the orbital inclination is well-known. The synchronous parameter is defined by using the orbital inclination $i$ and the observable rotational velocity $(V_{1,2} \sin i)_{M}$. The method is mainly suitable for eclipsing binary stars. Several others are suggested for the cases when the orbital inclination $i$ is unknown. The synchronous parameters are defined by using $a_{1,2} \sin i$, $m_{1,2} \sin^{3} i$, the mass function $f(m)$ and semi-amplitudes of the velocity curve, $K_{1,2}$ given in catalogue of parameters of spectroscopic binary systems and $(V_{1,2}\sin i)_{M}$. These methods are suitable for spectroscopic binary stars including those that show eclipses and visual binary stars concurrently. The synchronous parameters for fifty-five components in thirty binary systems are calculated by using several methods. The numerical results are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The statistical results are listed in Table 3. In addition, several apparent descriptive methods are discussed.</p>

				<title>GMRT HI Observations of the Eridanus Group of Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The GMRT HI 21cm-line observations of galaxies in the Eridanus group are presented. The Eridanus group, at a distance of $\sim 23$ Mpc, is a loose group of $\sim 200$ galaxies. The group extends to more than 10 Mpc in projection. The velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the group is $\sim 240$ km s$^{-1}$. The galaxies are clustered into different sub-groups. The overall population mix of the group is 30\%\ (E + S0) and 70\%\ (Sp + Irr). The observations of 57 Eridanus galaxies were carried out with the GMRT for $\sim 200$ h. HI emission was detected from 31 galaxies. The channel rms of $\sim 1$ mJy beam$^{-1}$ was achieved for most of the image-cubes made with 4 h of data. The corresponding HI column density sensitivity $(3\sigma)$ is $\sim 1\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ for a velocity-width of $\sim 13.4$ km s$^{-1}$. The $3\sigma$ detection limit of HI mass is $\sim 1.2\times 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ for a line-width of 50 km s$^{-1}$. Total HI images, HI velocity fields, global HI line profiles, HI mass surface densities, HI disk parameters and HI rotation curves are presented. The velocity fields are analysed separately for the approaching and the receding sides of the galaxies. These data will be used to study the HI and the radio continuum properties, the Tully–Fisher relations, the dark matter halos, and the kinematical and HI lopsidedness in galaxies.</p>

				<title>The HI Content of the Eridanus Group of Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0071-0087</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The HI content of galaxies in the Eridanus group is studied using the GMRT observations and the HIPASS data. A significant HI deficiency up to a factor of 2–3 is observed in galaxies in the high galaxy density regions. The HI deficiency in galaxies is observed to be directly correlated to the local projected galaxy density, and inversely correlated to the line-of-sight radial velocity. Furthermore, galaxies with larger optical diameters are predominantly in the lower galaxy density regions. It is suggested that the HI deficiency in Eridanus is due to tidal interactions. In some galaxies, evidences of tidal interactions are seen. An important implication is that significant evolution of galaxies can take place in the group environment. In the hierarchical way of formation of clusters via mergers of groups, a fraction of the observed HI deficiency in clusters could have originated in groups. The co-existence of S0s and severely HI deficient galaxies in the Eridanus group suggests that tidal interaction is likely to be an effective mechanism for transforming spirals to S0s.</p>

				<title>Radio Continuum and Far-infrared Emission from the Galaxies in the Eridanus Group</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0089-0102</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Eridanus galaxies follow the well-known radio–FIR correlation. The majority (70\%) of these galaxies have their star formation rates below that of the Milky Way. The galaxies that have a significant excess of radio emission are identified as low luminosity AGNs based on their radio morphologies obtained from the GMRT observations. There are no powerful AGNs ($L_{20 \text{\,cm}}\gt 10^{23}$W Hz$^{-1}$) in the group. The two most far-infrared and radio luminous galaxies in the group have optical and HI morphologies suggestive of recent tidal interactions. The Eridanus group also has two far-infrared luminous but radio-deficient galaxies. It is believed that these galaxies are observed within a few Myr of the onset of an intense star formation episode after being quiescent for at least a 100 Myr. The upper end of the radio luminosity distribution of the Eridanus galaxies ($L_{20 \text{\,cm}}\sim 10^{22}$W Hz$^{-1}$) is consistent with that of the field galaxies, other groups, and late-type galaxies in nearby clusters.</p>

				<title>Parametric Identification of Solar Series based on an Adaptive Parallel Methodology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0103-0115</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work we present an adaptive parallel methodology to optimize the identification of time series through parametric models, applying it to the case of sunspot series. We employ high precision computation of system identification algorithms, and use recursive least squares processing and ARMAX (Autoregressive Moving Average Extensive) parametric modelling. This methodology could be very useful when the high precision mathematical modelling of dynamic complex systems is required. After explaining the proposed heuristics and the tuning of its parameters, we showthe results we have found for several solar series using different implementations. Thus, we demonstrate how the result precision improves.</p>

				<title>Asteroseismology: Past, Present and Future</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0123-0138</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Asteroseismology studies stars with a wide variety of interior and surface conditions. For two decades asteroseismic techniques have been applied to many pulsating stars across the HR diagram. Asteroseismology is now a booming field of research with stunning new discoveries; I highlight a personal selection of these in this review, many of which are discussed in more detail elsewhere in these proceedings. For many years the Nainital–Cape Survey for northern roAp stars has been running at ARIES, so I emphasise new spectroscopic results for roAp stars and point out the outstanding prospects for the planned ARIES 3-m telescope at Devastal. High precision spectroscopy has revolutionised the asteroseismic study of some types of stars – particularly solar-like oscillators and roAp stars – while photometry is still the best way to study the frequency spectra that are the basic data of asteroseismology. New telescopes, new photometers and space missions are revolutionising asteroseismic photometry. In addition to the ground-based potential of asteroseismic spectroscopy, India has the knowledge and capability for space-based asteroseismic photometry. The future for asteroseismology is bright indeed, especially for Indian astronomers.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The sun being the nearest star, seismic observations with high spatial resolution are possible, thus providing accurate measurement of frequencies of about half million modes of solar oscillations covering a wide range of degree. With these data helioseismology has enabled us to study the solar interior in sufficient detail to infer the large-scale structure and rotation of the solar interior. With the availability of high quality helioseismic data over a good fraction of a solar cycle it is also possible to study temporal variations in solar structure and dynamics. Some of these problems and recent results will be discussed.</p>

				<page>0171-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The amplitude of solar-like oscillations results from a balance between excitation and damping. As in the sun, the excitation is attributed to turbulent motions that stochastically excite the $p$ modes in the uppermost part of the convective zone. We present here a model for the excitation mechanism. Comparisons between modeled amplitudes and helio and stellar seismic constraints are presented and the discrepancies discussed. Finally the possibility and the interest of detecting such stochastically excited modes in pre-main sequence stars are also discussed.</p>

				<title>HD 101065, the Most Peculiar Star: First Results from Precise Radial Velocity Study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0185-0191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we discuss the prospects for asteroseismology with spatial resolution and motivate studies of the most chemically peculiar roAp star HD 101065. We present the first results from a high-precision radial velocity (RV) study of HD 101065 based on data spanning four nights that were acquired using the HARPS echelle-spectrometer at the ESO 3.6 m telescope. The analysis of individual nights showed the amplitude and phase modulation of the dominant mode. The analysis of the whole data set showed the presence of multi-periodic oscillations with two groups of equally-spaced modes. We find $\Delta v = 65.2 \mu$Hz and $\delta v = 7.3\mu$Hz for the large and the small spacing, respectively. HD 101065 is the only roAp star to show the existence of two groups of $l = 0$, 2 and $l = 1$, 3 excited modes.</p>

					<p>Nainital;Cape Survey was started with an aim to search for new rapidly oscillating Ap stars in the northern hemisphere.We discovered one new mono-periodic roAp star HD 12098. The frequency separation of HD 12098 suggests a rotation period of 5.5 days for the star. We summarize here the observations of HD 12098 and briefly discuss the results of the multi-site observation campaign organized to resolve the ambiguity in the determination of the rotation period of HD 12098. Other interesting results like non-oscillating Ap stars discovered and two candidate stars in which roAp periodicity is seen but not confirmed are also discussed.</p>

				<title>Using the Seismology of Non-magnetic Chemically Peculiar Stars as a Probe of Dynamical Processes in Stellar Interiors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0231-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chemical composition is a good tracer of the hydrodynamical processes that occur in stars as they often lead to mixing and particle transport. By comparing abundances predicted by models and those observed in stars we can infer some constraints on those mixing processes. As pulsations in the stars are often very sensitive to chemical composition, we can use asteroseismology to probe the internal chemical composition of stars where no direct observations are possible. In this paper I focus on main sequence stars Am, $\gamma$ Bootis, and HgMn stars and discuss what we can learn of mixing processes in these stars from seismology.</p>

					<p>We give an overview of past and present efforts to make seismology of $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus stars possible. Previous work has not led to the observational detection and identification of a sufficient number of pulsation modes for these pulsators for the construction of unique seismic models. However, recent efforts including large ground-based observational campaigns, work on pre-main sequence pulsators, asteroseismic satellite missions, theoretical advances on mode identification methods, and the discovery of a star showing simultaneous self-excited $\delta$ Scuti and $\gama$ Doradus oscillations suggest that we may be able to explore the interiors of these pulsators in the very near future.</p>

				<page>0261-0271</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Subdwarf B stars play a significant role in close binary evolution and in the hot star content of old stellar populations, in particular in giant elliptical galaxies. While the question of their origin poses several problems for stellar evolution theory, one of their most fascinating properties is the presence of multi-periodic 2–3 minute oscillations. Interpreting these oscillations optimally requires the correct identification of the modes. Partial identifications can be obtained using high-speed observations of radial velocity and colour variations. We review some of the several attempts to make such observations, most recently with the Multi-Site Spectroscopic Telescope campaign and with ULTRACAM.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The interpretation of pulsation data for sun-like stars is currently facing challenges quite similar to those faced by white dwarf modelers ten years ago. The observational requirements for uninterrupted long-term monitoring are beginning to be satisfied by successful multi-site campaigns and dedicated satellite missions. But exploration of the most important physical parameters in theoretical models has been fairly limited, making it difficult to establish a detailed best-fit model for a particular set of oscillation frequencies. I review the past development and the current state of white dwarf asteroseismology, with an emphasis on what this can tell us about the road to success for asteroseismology of other types of stars.</p>

The main pitfalls and ambiguities occurring in Fourier analysis are summarized and illustrated. Someclassical, Least Squares (LS) based methods for spectrum analysis are analyzed and commented on from the point of view of ill-posed problems. The insight that can be gained from such analyses is discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Preliminary results on observations of open clusters are presented. The project has been initiated in the framework of the Uzbek–Taiwan and Taiwan–Baltic collaboration, mainly to upgrade and make use of facilities at Maidanak Observatory. We present detailed, multiwavelength studies of the young cluster NGC 6823 and the associated complex nebulosity, to diagnose the young stellar population and star formation history in the region. In addition, 7 compact open clusters have been monitored for stellar variability. We show how observations like these could feasibly be used to look for exoplanet transit events. We also expect to join the Whole-Earth Telescope effort in future campaigns for asteroseismology.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian team at ISRO has been part of the Whole Earth Telescope (WET) team since 1988 when we first participated in the campaign on V471 Tau.We have been part of many other observing campaigns over the last decade. This presentation traces the circumstances leading to our joining the WET team and how useful the coverage from the Indian longitude has been. The results of several pulsators from the WET runs during which we participated are also described. These include PG1159-035 the prototype of the GW Vir type of stars, RE J 0751+14 a cataclysmic variable, PG 1336-018 a binary with an sdB pulsator and finally HR 1217 a roAp star. The paper concludes with what the limitations are in our observations and how we can overcome them in the future.</p>

					<p>The Maidanak One-meter Telescope (MOT) is a Ritchey-Chretien telescope by Carl Zeiss, located atop Maidanak in Uzbekistan, where site parameters indicate excellent atmospheric seeing conditions. An effort to computerize the MOT, jointly made by an Uzbek, Taiwanese and Baltic consortium, is expected to complete in 2005. Monitoring the variability of star clusters will be among the first scientific projects to be carried out. Equipped with sensitive CCD cameras, the MOT, with its middle-Asia geographic location, will be a desirable addition to the Whole Earth Telescope (WET) network.We describe the upgrade engineering and instrumentation of the telescope and how the system can be used in future campaigns.</p>

				<title>Argos: An Optimized Time-Series Photometer</title>

				<page>0321-0330</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We designed a prime focus CCD photometer, Argos, optimized for high speed time-series measurements of blue variables (Nather &amp; Mukadam 2004) for the 2.1 m telescope at McDonald Observatory. Lack of any intervening optics between the primary mirror and the CCD makes the instrument highly efficient.We measure an improvement in sensitivity by a factor of nine over the 3-channel PMT photometers used on the same telescope and for the same exposure time. The CCD frame transfer operation triggered by GPS synchronized pulses serves as an electronic shutter for the photometer. This minimizes the dead time between exposures, but more importantly, allows a precise control of the start and duration of the exposure. We expect the uncertainty in our timing to be less than 100 $\mu$s.</p>

				<title>Facilities at ARIES for the Nainital–Cape Survey</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0339-0347</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A collaborative programme searching for mmag pulsations in chemically peculiar stars in the northern hemisphere was initiated in 1997 between Nainital, India, and Cape Town, South Africa. It was therefore named as the \textbf{Nainital–Cape Survey} programme. The detection limits imposed by the observing conditions (including atmospheric noise and telescope size) at both Manora Peak and Devasthal sites are described. The scintillation noise on the best photometric nights is $\approx 0.1$ to 0.2 mmag for these sites. Both places allow one to detect few mmag variation in bright stars ($B \leq 12$ mag), and are therefore particularly well-suited for carrying out the proposed surveywork. The main characteristics of the three-channel photometer developed at ARIES for carrying out the observations are also presented. This excellent instrument has been used extensively since 1999 at the f/13 Cassegrain focus of ARIES’ 104 cm telescope. In particular, it allowed the survey to result in the discovery of $\delta$ Scuti like pulsations in four Am stars, in one rapidly oscillating Ap star, and in a number of probable variables so far. The future prospects are then presented, which regard the acquisition of a high speed time series CCD photometer, a project to build a 3-metre class telescope at Devasthal, and collaborative observations with Indian and foreign astronomical sites.</p>

				<title>Unravelling the Nature of HD 81032 – A New RS CVn Binary</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0359-0376</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>BVR photometric and quasi-simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations of the star HD 81032 have been carried out during the years 2000–2004. A photometric period of 18.802 $\pm$ 0.07d has been detected for this star. A large group of spots with a migration period of 7.43 $\pm$ 0.07 years is inferred from the first three years of the data. H$\alpha$ and CaII H and K emissions from the star indicate high chromospheric activity. The available photometry in the BVRIJHK bands is consistent with the spectral type of K0IV previously found for this star.We have also examined the spectral energy distribution of HD 81032 for the presence of an infrared colour excess using the 2MASS JHK and IRAS photometry, but found no significant excess in any band above the normal values expected for a star with this spectral type. We have also analyzed the X-ray emission properties of this star using data obtained by the ROSAT X-ray observatory during its All-Sky Survey phase. An X-ray flare of about 12 hours duration was detected during the two days of X-ray coverage obtained for this star. Its X-ray spectrum, while only containing 345 counts, is inconsistent with a single-temperature component solar-abundance coronal plasma model, but implies either the presence of two or more plasma components, non-solar abundances, or a combination of both of these properties. All of the above properties of HD 81032 suggest that it is a newly identified, evolved RS CVn binary.</p>

					<p>This paper presents an analysis of a series of spectra in the Red Rectangle nebula. Only the reddest part of the spectra can safely be attributed to light from the nebula, and indicates Rayleigh scattering by the gas, in conformity with the large angles of scattering involved and the proximity of the star. In the blue, light from HD 44179, refracted or scattered in the atmosphere, dominates the spectra. This paper questions the reliability of ground-based broad-band spectra of extended objects in the blue.</p>

				<title>Average Anisotropy Characteristics of High Energy Cosmic Ray Particles and Geomagnetic Disturbance Index Ap</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0429-0434</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The average characteristics of the diurnal and semi-diurnal anisotropy of cosmic ray intensity at relativistic energies have been obtained by using data from the worldwide grid of neutron monitor for the period 1989 to 1996. The complex behaviour of the diurnal amplitudes and time of maxima (phase) and its association with the Ap index on a long-term and day-to-day basis have been studied. Even though the general characteristics, on a yearly average basis, have not changed significantly during this period, both the diurnal and semi-diurnal amplitudes and phases vary significantly, besides significant changes being observed for different interplanetary conditions on a short-term basis. It is found that the relationship between the Ap index and the diurnal vector is out of phase during the period 1991 to 1995. On a long-term basis, the correlation of diurnal variation with Ap index has been found to vary during the solar cycle. On a short-term basis, it has been observed that the high Ap days are usually associated with higher amplitudes with phase shifted to earlier hours.</p>

				<title>Small-scale Magnetic Field Diagnostics outside Sunspots: Comparison of Different Methods</title>

				<page>0435-0445</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyse different observational data related to the problem of intrinsic magnetic field strength in small-scale fluxtubes outside sunspots. We conclude that the kG range of fluxtube fields follows from not only classical line ratio method, but also from other old and new techniques. For the quiet regions on the Sun, the most probable mode of such fields has a magnetic field strength of 1.2–1.5 kG assuming the rectangular field profile. To best interpret the observations, a weak background field between fluxtubes should be assumed, and its magnetic field strength is expected to increase with the filling factor of fluxtubes. The alternative point of view about subkilogauss fluxtube fields is critically examined, and possible sources of different conclusions are presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reviving a calculation made by Eddington in the 1920s, and using the most recent and comprehensive databases available on stars and galaxies, including more than 2,500,000 stars and around 20,000 galaxies we have computed their total radiation received at the Earth just outside its atmosphere. This radiation density, if thermalized, would be equivalent to a temperature of 4.212 K. The comparability of this temperature to that of the cosmic microwave background (2.723 K) may either be a pure coincidence or may hold a key to some as yet unknown, aspect of the universe.</p>

				<title>The Tully–Fisher Relations of the Eridanus Group of Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0007-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Tully–Fisher (TF) or the luminosity–linewidth relations of the galaxies in the Eridanus group are constructed using the HI rotation curves and the luminosities in the optical and in the near-infrared bands. The slopes of the TF relations (absolute magnitude $vs$ $\log 2V_{\text{flat}}$) are $-8.6 \pm 1.1$, $-10.0\pm 1.5$, $-10.7 \pm 2.1$, and $-9.7 \pm 1.3$ in the R, J, H, and K bands respectively for galaxies having flat HI rotation curves. These values of the slopes are consistent with those obtained from studies of other groups and clusters. The scatter in the TF relations is in the range 0.5–1.1 mag in different bands. This scatter is considerably larger compared to those observed in other groups and clusters. It is suggested that the larger scatter in the TF relations for the Eridanus group is related to the loose structure of the group. If the TF relations are constructed using the baryonic mass (stellar + HI + Helium mass) instead of the stellar luminosity, nearly identical slopes are obtained in the R and in the near-infrared bands. The baryonic TF (baryonic mass $vs$ $\log 2V_{\text{flat}}$) slope is in the range 3.5–4.1.</p>

				<title>Variable Quasi Periodic Oscillations during an Outburst of the Transient X-ray Pulsar XTE J1858 + 034</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0025-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated the Quasi Periodic Oscillation (QPO) properties of the transient accreting X-ray pulsar XTE J1858 + 034 during the second outburst of this source in April–May 2004. We have used observations made with the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) during May 14–18, 2004, in the declining phase of the outburst. We detected the presence of low frequency QPOs in the frequency range of 140–185 mHz in all the RXTE-PCA observations. We report evolution of the QPO parameters with the time, X-ray flux, and X-ray photon energy. Though a correlation between the QPO centroid frequency and the instantaneous X-ray flux is not very clear from the data, we point out that the QPO frequency and the one day averaged X-ray flux decreased with time during these observations. We have obtained a clear energy dependence of the RMS variation in the QPOs, increasing from about 3\%\ at 3 keV to 6\%\ at 25 keV. The X-ray pulse profile is a single peaked sinusoidal, with pulse fraction increasing from 20\%\ at 3 keV to 45\%\ at 30 keV. We found that, similar to the previous outburst, the energy spectrum is well fitted with amodel consisting of a cut-off power law along with an iron emission line.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Here we report the spectral characteristics of the high and low states of the pulsar 4U 0114+65 and examine the change in the parameters of the spectral model. A power lawand a photoelectric absorption by material along the line of sight together with a high energy cut-off suffice to describe the continuum spectrum in both the states. A fluorescence iron line at $\sim 6.4$ keV is present in the high as well as in the low state, though it is less intense in the latter. The photon index, cut-off energy and e-folding energy values hardly show any discernible change over the states. We compare these spectral characteristics as observed with ASCA with those of other satellites. We also compare the spectral characteristics of 4U 0114 + 650 with other X-ray sources which show intensity variation at different time scales.</p>

				<title>Photometric Modelling of Close Binary Star CN And</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0047-0056</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The results of two color photometry of active close binary CN And are presented and analyzed. The light curves of the system are obviously asymmetric, with the primary maximum brighter than the secondary maximum, which is known as the O’Conell effect. The most plausible explanation of the asymmetry is expected to be due to spot activity of the primary component. For the determination of physical and geometrical parameters, the most new version of W–D code was used, but the presence of asymmetry prevented the convergence of the method when the whole light curves were used. The solutions were obtained by applying mode 3 of W–D code to the first half of the light curves, assuming synchronous rotation and zero eccentricity. Absolute parameters of the system were obtained from combining the photometric solution with spectroscopic data obtained from radial velocity curve analysis. The results indicate the poor thermal contact of the components and transit primary minimum. Finally the O–C diagram was analyzed. It was found that the orbital period of the system is changing with a rate of $dP/dt = -2.2(6) \times 10^{-10}$ which corresponds to mass transfer from more massive component to less massive with the rate of $dM/dt \sim 4.82 \times 10^{-8}8M_{\text{sun}}$/year.</p>

				<title>Why Study the Sun?</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0059-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this presentation we briefly describe the Sun through large number of illustrations and pictures of the Sun taken from early times to the present day space missions. The importance of the study of the Sun is emphasized as it is the nearest star which presents unparallelled views of surface details and numerous phenomena. Our Sun offers a unique celestial laboratory where a large variety of phenomena take place, ranging in temporal domain from a few milliseconds to several decades, in spatial domain from a few hundred kilometers to thousands of kilometers, and in the temperature domain from a few thousand degrees to several million degrees. Its mass motion ranges from thousandths to thousands of kilometers per second. Such an object provides us with a unique laboratory to study the state of matter in the Universe.</p>
					<p>The existing solar ground-based and space missions have already revealed several mysteries of the outer environment of our Sun and much more is going to come in the near future from planned new sophisticated ground-based solar telescopes and Space missions.</p>
					<p>The new technique of helioseismology has unravelled many secrets of the solar interior and has put the Standard Solar Model (SSM) on firm footing. The long-standing problem of solar neutrinos has been recently sorted out, and even the ‘back side’ view of the Sun can be seen using the technique of holographic helioseismology.</p>

				<title>Some Recent Developments in Solar Dynamo Theory</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0079-0085</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the current status of solar dynamo theory and describe the dynamo model developed by our group. The toroidal magnetic field is generated in the tachocline by the strong differential rotation and rises to the solar surface due to magnetic buoyancy to create active regions. The decay of these active regions at the surface gives rise to the poloidal magnetic field by the Babcock–Leighton mechanism. This poloidal field is advected by the meridional circulation first to high latitudes and then down below to the tachocline. Dynamo models based on these ideas match different aspects of observational data reasonably well.</p>

				<title>Nanoflares and Heating of the Solar Corona</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0093-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coronal heating by nanoflares is presented by using observational, analytical, numerical simulation and statistical results. Numerical simulations show the formation of numerous current sheets if the magnetic field is sheared and bipoles have unequal pole strengths. This fact supports the generation of nanoflares and heating by them. The occurrence frequency of transients such as flares, nano/microflares, on the Sun exhibits a power-law distribution with exponent α varying between 1.4 and 3.3. For nanoflares heating $\alpha$ must be greater than 2. It is likely that the nanoflare heating can be reproduced by dissipating Alfv´en waves. Only observations from future space missions such as Solar-B, to be launched in 2006, can shed further light on whether Alfvén waves or nanoflares, heat the solar corona.</p>

				<title>Evolving Coronal Holes and Interplanetary Erupting Stream Disturbances</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0101-0112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coronal holes and interplanetary disturbances are important aspects of the physics of the Sun and heliosphere. Interplanetary disturbances are identified as an increase in the density turbulence compared with the ambient solar wind. Erupting stream disturbances are transient large-scale structures of enhanced density turbulence in the interplanetary medium driven by the high-speed flows of low-density plasma trailing behind for several days. Here, an attempt has been made to investigate the solar cause of erupting stream disturbances, mapped by Hewish &amp; Bravo (1986) from interplanetary scintillation (IPS) measurements made between August 1978 and August 1979 at 81.5 MHz. The position of the sources of 68 erupting stream disturbances on the solar disk has been compared with the locations of newborn coronal holes and/or the areas that have been coronal holes previously. It is found that the occurrence of erupting stream disturbances is linked to the emergence of newcoronal holes at the eruption site on the solar disk.</p>
					<p>A coronal hole is indicative of a radial magnetic field of a predominant magnetic polarity. The newborn coronal hole emerges on the Sun, owing to the changes in magnetic field configuration leading to the opening of closed magnetic structure into the corona. The fundamental activity for the onset of an erupting stream seems to be a transient opening of pre-existing closed magnetic structures into a new coronal hole, which can support high-speed flow trailing behind the compression zone of the erupting stream for several days.</p>

				<title>Spectroscopic Studies of Solar Corona VI: Trend in Line-width Variation of Coronal Emission Lines with Height Independent of the Structure of Coronal Loops</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0115-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have obtained spectroscopic observations in coronal emission lines by choosing two lines simultaneously, one [Fe X] 6374 Å and the other [Fe XI] 7892 Å or [Fe XIII] 10747 Å or [Fe XIV] 5303 Å. We found that in 95 per cent of the coronal loops observed in 6374 Å, the FWHM of the emission line increases with height above the limb irrespective of the size, shape and orientation of the loop and that in case of 5303 Å line decreases with height in about 89 per cent of the coronal loops. The FWHM of 7892 Å and 10747 Å emission lines show intermediate behavior. The increase in the FWHM of 6374 Å line with height is the steepest among these four lines.We have also studied the intensity ratio and ratio of FWHM of these lines with respect to those of 6374 Å as a function height above the limb. We found that the intensity ratio of 7892 Å and 10747 Å lines with respect to 6374 Å line increases with height and that of 5303 Å to 6374 Å decreases with height above the limb. This implies that temperature in coronal loops will appear to increase with height in the intensity ratio plots of 7892 Å and 6374 Å; and 10747 Å and 6374 Å whereas it will appear to decrease with height in intensity ratio of 5303 Å to 6374 Å line <i>versus</i> height plot. These findings are up to a height of about 200 arcsec above the limb. The varying ratios with height indicate that relatively hotter and colder plasma in coronal loops interact with each other. Therefore, the observed increase in FWHM with height above the limb of coronal emission lines associated with plasma at about 1 MK may not be due to increase in non-thermal motions caused by coronal waves but due to interaction with the relatively hotter plasma. These findings also do not support the existing coronal loop models, which predict an increase in temperature of the loop with height above the limb.</p>

				<title>Magnetic Source Regions of Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0139-0149</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The majority of flare activity arises in active regions which contain sunspots, while Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) activity can also originate from decaying active regions and even so-called quiet solar regions which contain a filament. Two classes of CME, namely flare-related CME events and CMEs associated with filament eruption are well reflected in the evolution of active regions. The presence of significant magnetic stresses in the source region is a necessary condition for CME. In young active regions magnetic stresses are increased mainly by twisted magnetic flux emergence and the resulting magnetic footpoint motions. In old, decayed active regions twist can be redistributed through cancellation events. All the CMEs are, nevertheless, caused by loss of equilibrium of the magnetic structure. With observational examples we show that the association of CME, flare and filament eruption depends on the characteristics of the source regions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the strength of the magnetic field, the amount of possible free energy storage,</li>
						<li>the small- and large-scale magnetic topology of the source region as well as its evolution (new flux emergence, photospheric motions, cancelling flux), and</li>
						<li>the mass loading of the configuration (effect of gravity).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These examples are discussed in the framework of theoretical models.</p>

				<title>North–South Distribution of Solar Flares during Cycle 23</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0151-0157</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we investigate the spatial distribution of solar flares in the northern and southern hemispheres of the Sun that occurred during the period 1996 to 2003. This period of investigation includes the ascending phase, the maximum and part of the descending phase of solar cycle 23. It is revealed that the flare activity during this cycle is low compared to the previous solar cycle, indicating the violation of Gnevyshev–Ohl rule. The distribution of flares with respect to heliographic latitudes shows a significant asymmetry between northern and southern hemisphere which is maximum during the minimum phase of the solar cycle. The present study indicates that the activity dominates the northern hemisphere in general during the rising phase of the cycle (1997–2000). The dominance of northern hemisphere shifted towards the southern hemisphere after the solar maximum in 2000 and remained there in the successive years. Although the annual variations in the asymmetry time series during cycle 23 are quite different from cycle 22, they are comparable to cycle 21.</p>

				<title>Initiation of CMEs by Magnetic Flux Emergence</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0159-0166</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The initiation of solar Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is studied in the framework of numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The initial CME model includes a magnetic flux rope in spherical, axisymmetric geometry. The initial configuration consists of a magnetic flux rope embedded in a gravitationally stratified solar atmosphere with a background dipole magnetic field. The flux rope is in equilibrium due to an image current below the photosphere. An emerging flux triggering mechanism is used to make this equilibrium system unstable. When the magnetic flux emerges within the filament below the flux rope, this results in a catastrophic behavior similar to previous models. As a result, the flux rope rises and a current sheet forms below it. It is shown that the magnetic reconnection in the current sheet below the flux rope in combination with the outward curvature forces results in a fast ejection of the flux rope as observed for solar CMEs.We have done a parametric study of the emerging flux rate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report a detailed examination about the relationship between the evolution of the H$\alpha$ flare ribbons and the released magnetic energy during the April 10 2001 flare. In the H$\alpha$ images, several bright kernels are observed in the flare ribbons. We identified the conjugated footpoints, by analyzing the lightcurves at each H$\alpha$ kernels, and showed their connectivities during the flare. Then, based on the magnetic reconnection model, we calculated quantitatively the released energy by using the photospheric magnetic field strengths and separation speeds of the H$\alpha$ flare  ribbons. Finally, we examined the downward motions which are observed at the H$\alpha$ kernels. We found that the stronger the red-asymmetry tends to be associated with the brighter the H$\alpha$ kernel.</p>

				<title>Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS) Mission – Low Energy Payload – First Results</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0175-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the first results from the ‘Low Energy Detector’ payload of ‘Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS)’ mission, which was launched onboard GSAT-2 Indian spacecraft on 08 May 2003 by GSLV-D2 rocket to study the solar flares. The SOXS Low Energy Detector (SLD) payload was designed, developed and fabricated by Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in collaboration with Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC), Bangalore of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The SLD payload employs the state-of-the-art solid state detectors viz., Si PIN and Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) devices that operate at near room temperature ($-20^{\circ}$C). The dynamic energy range of Si PIN and CZT detectors are 4–25 keV and 4–56 keV respectively. The Si PIN provides sub-keV energy resolution while CZT reveals $\sim 1.7$ keV energy resolution throughout the dynamic range. The high sensitivity and sub-keV energy resolution of Si PIN detector allows the measuring of the intensity, peak energy and equivalent width of the Fe-line complex at approximately 6.7 keV as a function of time in all 8 M-class flares studied in this investigation. The peak energy ($E_{p}$) of Fe-line feature varies between 6.4 and 6.8 keV with increase in temperature from 9 to 34 MK. We found that the equivalent width ($w$) of Fe-line feature increases exponentially with temperature up to 20 MK but later it increases very slowly up to 28 MK and then it remains uniform around 1.55 keV up to 34 MK. We compare our measurements of $w$ with calculations made earlier by various investigators and propose that these measurements may improve theoretical models. We interpret the variation of both $E_{p}$ and $w$ with temperature as the changes in the ionization and recombination conditions in the plasma during the flare interval and as a consequence the contribution from different ionic emission lines also varies.</p>

				<title>Enigmatic Solar Wind Disappearance Events – Do We Understand Them?</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0201-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At the Sun–Earth distance of one astronomical unit (1 AU), the solar wind is known to be strongly supersonic and super Alfvénic with Mach and Alfvén numbers being on average 12 and 9 respectively. Also, solar wind densities (average $\sim 10$ cm$^{-3}$) and velocities (average $\sim 450$ km s$^{-1}$) at 1 AU, are known to be inversely correlated with low velocities having higher than average densities and <i>vice versa</i>. However, on May 11 and 12 1999 the Earth was engulfed by an unusually low density ($\lt 0.1$ cm$^{-3}$) and low velocity ($\lt 350$ km s$^{-1}$) solar wind with an Alfvén Mach number significantly less than 1. This was a unique low-velocity, low-density, sub-Alfvénic solar wind flow which spacecraft observations have shown lasted more than 24 hours. One consequence of this extremely tenuous solar wind was a spectacular expansion of the Earth’s magnetosphere and bow shock. The expanding bow shock was observed by several spacecraft and reached record upstream distances of nearly 60 Earth radii, the lunar orbit. The event was so dramatic that it has come to be known as <i>the solar wind disappearance event</i>. Though extensive studies of this event were made by many authors in the past, it has only been recently shown that the unusual solar wind flows characterizing this event originated from a small coronal hole in the vicinity of a large active region on the Sun. These recent results have put to rest speculation that such events are associated with global phenomenon like the periodic solar polar field reversal that occurs at the maximum of each solar cycle. In this paper we revisit the 11 May 1999 event, look at other disappearance events that have ocurred in the past, examine the reasons why speculations about the association of such events with global phenomena like solar polar field reversals were made and also examine the role of transient coronal holes as a possible solar source for such events.</p>

				<title>Transient Perturbations and their Effects in the Heliosphere, the Geo-magnetosphere, and the Earth’s Atmosphere: Space Weather Perspective</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0209-0217</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the effects of certain dynamic features of space environment in the heliosphere, the geo-magnetosphere, and the earth’s atmosphere. In particular, transient perturbations in solar wind plasma, interplanetary magnetic field, and energetic charged particle (cosmic ray) fluxes near 1 AU in the heliosphere have been discussed. Transient variations in magnetic activity in geo-magnetosphere and solar modulation effects in the heliosphere have also been studied. Emphasis is on certain features of transient perturbations related to space weather effects. Relationships between geomagnetic storms and transient modulations in cosmic ray intensity (Forbush decreases), especially those caused by shock-associated interplanetary disturbances, have been studied in detail. We have analysed the cosmic ray, geomagnetic and interplanetary plasma/field data to understand the physical mechanisms of two phenomena namely, Forbush decrease and geomagnetic storms, and to search for precursors to Forbush decrease (and geomagnetic storms) that can be used as a signature to forecast space weather. It is shown that the use of cosmic ray records has practical application for space weather predictions. Enhanced diurnal anisotropy and intensity deficit of cosmic rays have been identified as precursors to Forbush decreases in cosmic ray intensity. It is found that precursor to smaller (less than 5\%) amplitude Forbush decrease due to weaker interplanetary shock is enhanced diurnal anisotropy. However, larger amplitude (greater than 5\%) Forbush decrease due to stronger interplanetary shock shows loss cone type intensity deficit as precursor in ground based intensity record. These precursors can be used as inputs for space weather forecast.</p>

				<title>Geo-effectiveness of Solar Wind Extremes</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0227-0235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Examples of extreme events of solar wind and their effect on geomagnetic conditions are discussed here. It is found that there are two regimes of high speed solar wind streams with a threshold of $\sim 850$ km s$^{-1}$. Geomagnetic activity enhancement rate (GAER) is defined as an average increase in Ap value per unit average increase in the peak solar wind velocity (Vp) during the stream. GAER was found to be different in the two regimes of high speed streams with +ve and $-$ve IMF. GAER is 0.73 and 0.53 for solar wind streams with +ve and $-$ve IMF respectively for the extremely high speed streams ($\lt 850$ km s$^{-1}$). This indicates that streams above the threshold speed with +ve IMF are 1.4 times more effective in enhancing geomagnetic activity than those with $-$ve IMF. However, the high speed streams below the threshold with $-$ve IMF are 1.1 times more effective in enhancing geomagnetic activity than those with +ve IMF. The violent solar activity period (October–November 2003) of cycle 23 presents a very special case during which many severe and strong effects were seen in the environment of the Earth and other planets; however, the z-component of IMF (Bz) is mostly positive during this period. The most severe geomagnetic storm of this cycle occurred when Bz was positive.</p>

				<title>The Challenge of Predicting the Occurrence of Intense Storms</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0237-0242</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geomagnetic super-storms of October and November 2003 are compared in order to identify solar and interplanetary variables that influence the magnitude of geomagnetic storms. Although these super-storms (${\rm D}_{\text{ST}} \lt -300$ nT) are associated with high speed CMEs, their ${\rm D}_{\text{ST}}$ indices show large variation. The most intense storm of November 20, 2003 (${\rm D}_{\text{ST}}\sim -472$ nT) had its source in a comparatively small active region and was associated with a relatively weaker, M-class flare, while the others had their origins in large active regions and were associated with strong X-class flares. An attempt has been made to implement a logistic regression model for the prediction of the occurrence of intense/super-intense geomagnetic storms. The model parameters (regression coefficients) were estimated from a training data-set extracted from a data-set of 64 geo-effective CMEs observed during 1996–2002. The results indicate that logistic regression models can be effectively used for predicting the occurrence of major geomagnetic storms from a set of solar and interplanetary factors. The model validation shows that 100\%\ of the intense storms ($-200$ nT $\lt {\rm D}_{\text{ST}} \lt -100$ nT) and only 50\%\ of the super-intense (${\rm D}_{\text{ST}} \lt -200$ nT) storms could be correctly predicted.</p>

					<p>NOAA 10486 produced several powerful flares, including the 4B/X17.2 superflare of October 28, 2003/11:10 UT. This flare was extensively covered by the H$_{\alpha}$ and GONG instruments operated at the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO). The central location of the active region on October 28, 2003was well-suited for the ring diagram analysis to obtain the 3-D power spectra and search for helioseismic response of this large flare on the amplitude, frequency and width of the p-modes. Further, using USO observations, we have identified the sites of new flux emergences, large proper motions and line-of-sight velocity flows in the active region and their relationship with the flare.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We observed 4B/X17.2 flare in H$\alpha$ from super-active region NOAA 10486 at ARIES, Nainital. This is one of the largest flares of current solar cycle 23, which occurred near the Sun’s center and produced extremely energetic emission almost at allwavelengths from $\gamma$-ray to radio-waves. The flare is associated with a bright/fast full-halo earth directed CME, strong type II, type III and type IV radio bursts, an intense proton event and GLE. This flare is well observed by SOHO, RHESSI and TRACE. Our H$\alpha$ observations show the stretching/de-twisting and eruption of helically twisted S shaped (sigmoid) filament in the south–west direction of the active region with bright shock front followed by rapid increase in intensity and area of the gigantic flare. The flare shows almost similar evolution in H$\alpha$, EUV and UV. We measure the speed of H$\alpha$ ribbon separation and the mean value is $\sim 70$ km s$^{-1}$. This is used together with photospheric magnetic field to infer a magnetic reconnection rate at three HXR sources at the flare maximum. In this paper, we also discuss the energetics of active region filament, flare and associated CME.</p>

				<title>The Flares Associated with the Dynamics of the Sunspots</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0277-0284</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we consider six years data of spot groups that have well developed leading and following spots obtained from the Kodaikanal Observatory white light pictures and occurrence of H$\alpha$ flares. From the daily observations, we compute the variations in rotation rates, meridional velocity, the areas and longitudinal separations. We find that among all these variations, the occurrence of abnormal rotation rates (the rotation rates that have greater than $1\sigma$) and longitudinal minimum separation during the course of their evolution eventually lead to triggering of flares. We also find that the events of abnormal rotation rates, longitudinal minimum separation and the flares occur mainly during the 50–80\%\ of the sunspots’ life span indicating magnetic reconnection probably below (0.935 $R_{\odot}$) the solar surface. Relevance of these results with the conventional theory of magnetic reconnection is briefly discussed.</p>

				<title>Design and Status of Solar Vector Magnetograph (SVM-I) at Udaipur Solar Observatory</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0285-0292</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the status of the instrument called Solar Vector Magnetograph Phase-I (SVM-I) currently being developed at Udaipur Solar Observatory. SVM-I is an instrument which aims to determine the magnetic field vector in the solar atmosphere by measuring Zeeman induced polarization across the spectral line. The instrument is currently in a preliminary development stage, with all components under an evaluation process. The integration of components is being done. The integrated performance of the system on a tracking mount and its control software is being tested. Some test observations of sunspots has been carried out. In this paper we give a technical description of the hardware and software elements of the instrument and present the polarized images obtained during test observations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The solar observational facilities at ARIES (erstwhile U.P. State Observatory, UPSO), Nainital, began in the sixties with the acquisition of two moderate sized (25 cm, f/66 off-axis Skew Cassegrain and 15 cm, f/15 refractor) telescopes. Both these systems receive sunlight through a 45 cm and 25 cm coelostat respectively. The backend instruments to these systems comprised of a single pass grating spectrograph for spectroscopic study of the Sun and a Bernhard–Halle $H\alpha$ filter, coupled with a Robot recorder camera for solar patrolling in $H\alpha$ respectively. With the advancement in solar observing techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution in $H\alpha$ and other wavelengths, it became inevitable to acquire sophisticated instrumentation for data acquisition. In view of that, the above facilities were upgraded, owing to which the conventional photographic techniques were replaced by the CCD camera systems attached with two 15 cm, f/15 Coude refractor telescopes. These CCD systems include the Peltier cooled CCD camera and photometrics PXL high speed modular CCD camera which provide high temporal and spatial resolution of $\sim 25$ ms and $\sim 1.3$ arcsec respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS) mission onboard GSAT-2 Indian Spacecraft was launched on 08 May 2003 using GSLV–D2 rocket by Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). SOXS aims to study solar flares, which are the most violent and energetic phenomena in the solar system, in the energy range of 4–56 keV with high spectral and temporal resolution. SOXS employs state-of-the-art semiconductor devices, viz., Si-Pin and CZT detectors to achieve sub-keV energy resolution requirements. In this paper, we present an overview of data acquisition, control, communication and computation of low energy payload of the SOXS mission.</p>

				<page>0315-0320</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The index of scintillation measurement is a good parameter to compare different sites for image quality or ‘seeing’.We have developed a scintillometer, which is deployed on the high resolution SPAR telescope in the island site of Udaipur Solar Observatory, for the site characterization to specify the proposed MAST (Multi Application Solar Telescope).</p>
					<p>The scintillometer consists of a miniature telescope, termed as micro telescope (4mm aperture, 15mm focal length) mounted on a drive which tracks the Sun continuously, associated amplifiers and a data acquisition system. A photodiode is used as the detector. The telescope along with detector was obtained from National Solar Observatory (NSO), and is similar to the one used for Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) site survey. At USO we developed the amplifier and data acquisition system for the scintillometer. A 24-bit analog to digital converter based system was designed, assembled, tested and used as the data acquisition system (DAS). In this paper, we discuss the instrumentation and present the initial results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study the spatial damping of magnetoacoustic waves in an unbounded quiescent prominence invoking the technique of MHD seismology. We consider Newtonian radiation in the energy equation and derive a fourth order general dispersion relation in terms of wavenumber $k$. Numerical solution of dispersion relation suggests that slow mode is more affected by radiation. The high frequency waves have been found to be highly damped. The uncertainty in the radiative relaxation time, however, does not allow us to conclude if the radiation is a dominant damping mechanism in quiescent prominence.</p>

				<title>Observational Searches for Chromospheric $g$-Mode Oscillations from CaII H-Line Observations</title>
				<feature>Poster Papers</feature>
				<page>0327-0331</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have used a high spatial and temporal resolution of long time sequence of spectra in CaII H-line obtained at the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) of the Sacramento Peak Observatory on a quiet region at the center of the solar disk over a large number of bright points and network elements to search for atmospheric (chromospheric) $g$-mode oscillations. An important parameter of the H-line profile, intensity at H$_{\text{2V}}$(I$_{\text{H2V}}$), has been derived from a large number of line profiles. We derived the light curves of all the bright points and network elements. The light curves represent the main pulse with large intensity amplitude and followed by several follower pulses with lower intensity amplitudes. The light curves of these bright points would give an impression that one can as well draw curves towards and away from the highest peak (main pulse) showing an exponential growth and decay of the amplitudes. An exponential decaying function has been fitted for all the light curves of the bright points to determine the damping time of the modes that are more or less the same, and one value of the coefficient of exponent can represent reasonably well the decay for all the cases. The FFT analysis of temporal variation of both the bright points and the network elements indicates around 10-min periodicity. We speculate that this longer period of oscillation may be related to chromospheric $g$-mode oscillations.</p>

					<p>The positional measurements of sunspots from the Kodaikanal Observatory and Solar Geophysical data are used to study the association between occurrence of the abnormal activities of big sunspot groups that were observed during the period of October–November 2003 and occurrence of the flares.

				<title>Study of Microflares through SOXS Mission</title>
				<feature>Poster Papers</feature>
				<page>0339-0346</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a study of 10 microflares observed in 4–30 keV by SOXS mission simultaneously with H$\alpha$ observations made at NAOJ, Japan during the interval between February and August 2004. The X-ray and H$\alpha$ light curves showed that the lifetime of microflares varies between 4 and 25 min. We found that the X-ray emission in all microflares under study in the dynamic energy range of 4–30 keV can be fitted by thermal plus non-thermal components. The thermal spectrum appeared to start from almost 4 keV, low level discriminator (LLD) of both Si and CZT detectors, however it ends below 8 keV. We also observed the Fe line complex features at 6.7 keV in some microflares and attempted to fit this line by isothermal temperature assumption. The temperature of isothermal plasma of microflares varies in the range between 8.6 and 10.1 MK while emission measure between 0.5 and $2\times 10^{49}$ cm$^{-3}$. Non-thermal (NT) emission appeared in the energy range 7–15 keV with exponent $-6.8 \leq \gamma \leq -4.8$. Our study of microflares that had occurred on 25 February 2004 showed that sometimes a given active region produces recurrent microflare activity of a similar nature.We concluded from X-ray and simultaneous H$\alpha$ observations that the microflares are perhaps the result of the interaction of low lying loops. It appears that the electrons that accelerated during reconnection heat the ambient coronal plasma as well as interact with material while moving down along the loops and thereby produce H$\alpha$ bright kernels.</p>

We have tried to study the morphology of the event, energy budget of the prominence and associated CMEs.

				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of solar wind–magnetosphere coupling is investigated for intense geomagnetic storms ($D_{\text{st}} \leq -100$ nT) that occurred during solar cycle 23. For this purpose interplanetary plasma and field data during some intensely geo-effective transient solar/interplanetary disturbances have been analysed. A geomagnetic index that represents the intensity of planetary magnetic activity at subauroral latitude and the other that measures the ring current magnetic field, together with solar plasma and field parameters (V, B, B$_{\text{z}}$, $\sigma_{\text{B}}$, N, and T) and their various derivatives (BV, $-$BVz, BV$^{2}$, $-$BzV$^{2}$, B$^{2}$V, Bz$^{2}$V, NV$^{2}$) have been analysed in an attempt to study mechanism and the cause of geo-effectiveness of interplanetary manifestations of transient solar events. Several functions of solar wind plasma and field parameters are tested for their ability to predict the magnitude of geomagnetic storm.</p>

				<title>Gravitational Clustering of Galaxies in an Expanding Universe</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0373-0379</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We inquire the phenomena of clustering of galaxies in an expanding universe from a theoretical point of view on the basis of thermodynamics and correlation functions. The partial differential equation is developed both for the point mass and extended mass structures of a two-point correlation function by using thermodynamic equations in combination with the equation of state taking gravitational interaction between particles into consideration. The unique solution physically satisfies a set of boundary conditions for correlated systems and provides a new insight into the gravitational clustering problem.</p>

				<title>QSO Pairs <i>across</i> Active Galaxies: Evidence of Blueshifts?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0381-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several QSO pairs have been reported and their redshifts determined, where the two objects in each pair are located <i>across</i> an active galaxy. The usually accepted explanation of such occurrences is that the pair is ejected from the parent galaxy. Currently interpreted redshifted spectra for both the QSOs imply that both the objects are receding from the observer. However, ejection can occur towards and away from the observer with equal probability. We argue that for a system with two QSOs lying across the parent galaxy, ejection should have occurred in opposite directions, whereby one object will be approaching us and the other will be receding from us. The former would exhibit a blueshifted spectrum. We analyse here a sample of four such pairs and show that the observed spectrum of one QSO in each pair can be interpreted as blueshifted. The other exhibits the usual redshifted spectrum. A scenario based on the ‘sling-shot’ mechanism of ejection is presented to explain the occurrences of the pairs in opposite sides of the active galaxies moving in opposite directions.</p>

				<title>Report on the Dynamical Evolution of an Axially Symmetric Quasar Model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0389-0397</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The role of the angular momentum in the regular or chaotic character of motion in an axially symmetric quasar model is examined. It is found that, for a given value of the critical angular momentum $L_{zc}$, there are two values of the mass of the nucleus $M_{n}$ for which transition from regular to chaotic motion occurs. The $[L_{zc}-M_{n}]$ relationship shows a linear dependence for the time independent model and an exponential dependence for the evolving model. Both cases are explained using theoretical arguments together with some numerical evidence. The evolution of the orbits is studied, as mass is transported from the disk to the nucleus. The results are compared with the outcomes derived for galactic models with massive nuclei.</p>

					<p>We have constructed two gas-phase models to study the chemistry of circumstellar envelope surrounding the carbon-rich variable star IRAS 15194–5115. The network used consists of 3893 reactions involving 397 gas-phase species. The derived fractional abundances for many molecules are in excellent agreement with values obtained from observations. The predicted column densities from the two models go well with the observed values of carbon star IRC + 10216.

				<title>Orbital Evolution and Orbital Phase Resolved Spectroscopy of the HMXB Pulsar 4U 1538–52 with RXTE-PCA and BeppoSAX</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0411-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here results from detailed timing and spectral studies of the high mass X-ray binary pulsar 4U 1538–52 over several binary periods using observations made with the Rossi X-rayTiming Explorer (RXTE) and BeppoSAX satellites. Pulse timing analysis with the 2003 RXTE data over two binary orbits confirms an eccentric orbit of the system. Combining the orbitial parameters determined from this observation with the earlier measurements we did not find any evidence of orbital decay in this X-ray binary. We have carried out orbital phase resolved spectroscopy to measure changes in the spectral parameters with orbital phase, particularly the absorption column density and the iron line flux. The RXTE-PCA spectra in the 3–20 keV energy range were fitted with a power law and a high energy cut-off alongwith a Gaussian line at $\sim 6.4$ keV, whereas the BeppoSAX spectra needed only a power law and Gaussian emission line at $\sim 6.4$ keV in the restricted energy range of 0.3–10.0 keV. An absorption along the line of sight was included for both the RXTE and BeppoSAX data. The variation of the free spectral parameters over the binary orbit was investigated and we found that the variation of the column density of absorbing material in the line of sight with orbital phase is in reasonable agreement with a simple model of a spherically symmetric stellar wind from the companion star.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Solar flares are known to release a large amount of energy. It is believed that the flares can excite velocity oscillations in active regions. We report here the changes in velocity signals in three active regions which have produced large X-class flares. The enhanced velocity signals appeared during the rise time of the GOES soft X-ray flux. These signals are located close to the vicinity of the hard X-ray source regions as observed with RHESSI. The power maps of the active region show enhancement in the frequency regime 5–6.5 mHz, while there is feeble or no enhancement of these signals in 2–4 mHz frequency band. High energy particles with sufficient momentum seem to be the cause for these observed enhanced velocity signals.</p>

				<title>Interpretation of the Global Anisotropy in the Radio Polarizations of Cosmologically Distant Sources</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0443-0454</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a detailed statistical study of the observed anisotropy in radio polarizations from distant extragalactic objects. This anisotropy was earlier found by Birch (1982) and reconfirmed by Jain and Ralston (1999) in a larger data set. A very strong signal was seen after imposing the cut $|RM-\overline{RM}| \gt 6$ rad/m$^{2}$, where $RM$ is the rotation measure and $\overline{RM}$ its mean value. In this paper, we show that there are several indications that this anisotropy cannot be attributed to bias in the data. We also find that a generalized statistic shows a very strong signal in the entire data without imposing the $RM$ dependent cut. Finally we argue that an anisotropic background pseudoscalar field can explain the observations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed correlative analysis between sunspot numbers (SSN) and tilt angle (TA) with cosmic ray intensity (CRI) in the neutron monitor energy range has been performed for the solar cycles 21, 22 and 23. It is found that solar activity parameters (SSN and TA) are highly (positive) correlated with each other and have inverse correlation with cosmic ray intensity (CRI). The ‘running cross correlation coefficient’ between cosmic ray intensity and tilt angle has also been calculated and it is found that the correlation is positive during the maxima of odd cycles 21 and 23. Moreover, the time lag analysis between CRI and SSN, and between CRI and TA has also been performed and is supported by hysteresis curves, which are wide for odd cycles and narrow for even cycles.</p>

				<feature></feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the effect of viscosity and magnetic diffusivity on the oblique propagation and dissipation of Alfvén waves with respect to the normal outward direction, making use of MHD equations, density, temperature and magnetic field structure in coronal holes and underlying magnetic funnels. We find reduction in the damping length scale, group velocity and energy flux density as the propagation angle of Alfvén waves increases inside the coronal holes. For any propagation angle, the energy flux density and damping length scale also show a decrement in the source region of the solar wind ($\lt 1.05$ R$_{\odot}$) where these may be one of the primary energy sources, which can convert the inflow of the solar wind into the outflow. In the outer region ($\gt 1.21$ R$_{\odot}$), for any propagation angle, the energy flux density peaks match with the peaks of MgX 609.78 Å and 624.78 Å linewidths observed from the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on SOHO and the non-thermal velocity derived from these observations, justify the observed spectroscopic signature of the Alfvén wave dissipation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, an efficient iterative method of arbitrary integer order of convergence $\gt 2$ has been established for solving the hyperbolic form of Kepler’s equation. The method is of a dynamic nature in the sense that, moving from one iterative scheme to the subsequent one, only additional instruction is needed. Most importantly, the method does not need any prior knowledge of the initial guess. A property which avoids the critical situations between divergent and very slow convergent solutions that may exist in other numerical methods which depend on initial guess. Computational Package for digital implementation of the method is given and is applied to many case studies.</p>

				<title>Modeling Repulsive Gravity with Creation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0027</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is a growing interest among cosmologists for theories with negative energy scalar fields and creation, in order to model a repulsive gravity. The classical steady state cosmology proposed by Bondi, Gold &amp; Hoyle in 1948, was the first such theory which used a negative kinetic energy creation field to invoke creation of matter. We emphasize that creation plays a very crucial role in cosmology and provides a natural explanation to the various explosive phenomena occurring in local $(z \lt 0.1)$ and extra galactic universe.We exemplify this point of view by considering the resurrected version of this theory – the quasi-steady state theory, which tries to relate creation events directly to the large scale dynamics of the universe and supplies more natural explanations of the observed phenomena.</p>
					<p>Although the theory predicts a decelerating universe at the present era, it explains successfully the recent SNe Ia observations (which require an accelerating universe in the standard cosmology), as we show in this paper by performing a Bayesian analysis of the data.</p>

				<title>Kinematical Diagrams for Conical Relativistic Jets</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0029-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present diagrams depicting the expected inter-dependences of two key kinematical parameters of radio knots in the parsec-scale jets of blazars, deduced from VLBI observations. The two parameters are the apparent speed ($v_{\text{app}} = c\beta_{\text{app}}$) and the <i>effective</i> Doppler boosting factor ($\delta_{\text{eff}}$) of the relativistically moving radio knot. A novel aspect of these analytical computations of $\beta$–$\delta$ diagrams is that they are made for parsecscale jets having a <i>conical</i> shape, with modest opening angles ($\omega$ up to $10^{\circ}$), in accord with the VLBI observations of the nuclei of the nearest radio galaxies. Another motivating factor is the recent finding that consideration of a conical geometry can have important implications for the interpretation of a variety of radio observations of blazar jets. In addition to uniform jet flows (i.e., those having a uniform bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$), computational results are also presented for stratified jets where an ultra-relativistic central spine along the jet axis is surrounded by a slower moving sheath, possibly arising from a velocity shear.</p>

				<title>GMRT and VLA Observations at 49 cm and 20 cm of the HII Region near $l = 24.8^{\circ}$, $b = 0.1^{\circ}$</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report multi-frequency radio continuum and hydrogen radio recombination line observations of HII regions near $l = 24.8^{\circ}$, $b = 0.1^{\circ}$ using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope(GMRT) at 1.28 GHz $(n = 172)$, 0.61 GHz ($n = 220$) and the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.42 GHz ($n = 166$). The region consists of a large number of resolved HII regions and a few compact HII regions as seen in our continuum maps, many of which have associated infrared (IR) point sources. The largest HII region at $l = 24.83^{\circ}$ and $b = 0.1^{\circ}$ is a few arcmins in size and has a shell-type morphology. It is a massive HII region enclosing $\sim 550 M_{\odot}$ with a linear size of 7 pc and an rms electron density of $\sim 110$ cm^{-3}$ at a kinematic distance of 6 kpc. The required ionization can be provided by a single star of spectral type O5.5.</p>
					<p>We also report detection of hydrogen recombination lines from the HII region at $l = 24.83^{\circ}$ and $b = 0.1^{\circ}$ at all observed frequencies near $V_{lsr} = 100$ km s$^{-1}$. We model the observed integrated line flux density as arising in the diffuse HII region and find that the best fitting model has an electron density comparable to that derived from the continuum.We also report detection of hydrogen recombination lines from two other HII regions in the field.</p>

				<title>Evolution of the Distribution of Neutron Exposures in the Galaxy Disc: An Analytical Model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0055-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, based on the analytical model with delayed production approximation developed by Pagel &amp; Tautvaišienė (1995) for the Galaxy, the analytic solutions of the distribution of neutron exposures of the Galaxy (hereafter NEG) are obtained. The present results appear to reasonably reproduce the distribution of neutron exposures of the solar system (hereafter NES). The strong component and the main component of the NES are built up in different epochs. Firstly, the strong component is produced by the s-process nucleosynthesis in the metal-poor AGB stars, starting from [Fe/H] $\approx -1.16$ to [Fe/H] $\approx -0.66$, corresponding to the time interval $1.06 \lt t \lt 2.6$ Gyr. Secondly, the main component is produced by the s-process in the galactic disk AGB stars, starting from [Fe/H] $\approx -0.66$ to [Fe/H] $\approx 0$, corresponding to the time interval $t \gt 2.6$ Gyr. The analytic solutions have the advantage of an understanding of the structure and the properties of the NEG. The NEG is believed to be an effective tool to study the s-process element abundance distributions in the Galaxy at different epochs and the galactic chemical evolution of the neutron-capture elements.</p>

				<title>Cosmology and Cosmogony in a Cyclic Universe</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0067-0099</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we discuss the properties of the quasi-steady state cosmological model (QSSC) developed in 1993 in its role as a cyclic model of the universe driven by a negative energy scalar field. We discuss the origin of such a scalar field in the primary creation process first described by F. Hoyle &amp; J. V. Narlikar forty years ago. It is shown that the creation processes which take place in the nuclei of galaxies are closely linked to the high energy and explosive phenomena, which are commonly observed in galaxies at all redshifts.</p>
					<p>The cyclic nature of the universe provides a natural link between the places of origin of the microwave background radiation (arising in hydrogen burning in stars), and the origin of the lightest nuclei (H, D, He$^{3}$ and He$^{4}$). It also allows us to relate the large scale cyclic properties of the universe to events taking place in the nuclei of galaxies. Observational evidence shows that ejection of matter and energy from these centers in the form of compact objects, gas and relativistic particles is responsible for the population of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and gamma-ray burst sources in the universe.</p>
					<p>In the later parts of the paper we briefly discuss the major unsolved problems of this integrated cosmological and cosmogonical scheme – the understanding of the origin of the intrinsic redshifts, and the periodicities in the redshift distribution of the QSOs.</p>

				<title>Some Doubts on the Validity of the Foreground Galactic Contribution Subtraction from Microwave Anisotropies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0101-0116</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Galactic foreground contamination in CMBR anisotropies, especially from the dust component, is not easily separable from the cosmological or extragalactic component. In this paper, some doubts will be raised concerning the validity of the methods used until now to remove Galactic dust emission and will show that none of them achieves its goal.</p>
					<p>First, I review the recent bibliography on the topic and discuss critically the methods of foreground subtraction: the cross-correlation with templates, analysis assuming the spectral shape of the Galactic components, the “maximum entropy method”, “internal linear combination”, and “wavelet-based high resolution fitting of internal templates”. Second, I analyse the Galactic latitude dependence from WMAP data. The frequency dependence is discussed with data in the available literature. The result is that all methods of subtracting the Galactic contamination are inaccurate. The Galactic latitude dependence analysis or the frequency dependence of the anisotropies in the range 50–250 GHz put a constraint on the maximum Galactic contribution in the power spectrum to be less than $\sim 10\%$ (68\%\ C. L.) for an $\sim 1$ degree scale, and possibly higher for larger scales.</p>
					<p>The origin of most of the signals in the CMBR anisotropies is not Galactic. In any case, the subtraction of the galaxy is not accurate enough to allow a “precision Cosmology”; other sources of contamination (extragalactic, solar system) are also present.</p>

					<p>In this study we show how errors due to finite box size affect formation and the destruction rate for haloes in cosmological N-body simulations.

				<abstract>
					<p>In an earlier analysis it was demonstrated that general relativity gives higher values of surface tension in strange stars with quark matter than neutron stars. We generate the modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation to incorporate anisotropic matter and use this to show that pressure anisotropy provides for a wide range of behaviour in the surface tension than is the case with isotropic pressures. In particular, it is possible that anisotropy drastically decreases the value of the surface tension.</p>

				<title>Does Si Play a Role in the Formation of Extrasolar Planet Systems?</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>With the high signal-to-noise ratio spectra, we obtained Si abundances of 22 extrasolar planet host stars, and discussed some constraints on the planet formation. Using our silicon abundance results and other authors’ Si abundance studies about planets-harboring stars, we investigated the correlation between the dynamical properties and the silicon abundance. We propose a hypothesis that higher primordial metallicity in the host stars’ birth cloud with higher abundance of Si will make the cloud more sticky to bypass the time scale restriction in planet formation and easier to form the planets.</p>

				<title>Activity Cycle of Solar Filaments</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0147-0156</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Long-term variation in the distribution of the solar filaments observed at the Observatorie de Paris, Section de Meudon from March 1919 to December 1989 is presented to compare with sunspot cycle and to study the periodicity in the filament activity, namely the periods of the coronal activity with the Morlet wavelet used. It is inferred that the activity cycle of solar filaments should have the same cycle length as sunspot cycle, but the cycle behavior of solar filaments is globally similar in profile with, but different in detail from, that of sunspot cycles. The amplitude of solar magnetic activity should not keep in phase with the complexity of solar magnetic activity. The possible periods in the filament activity are about 10.44 and 19.20 years. The wavelet local power spectrum of the period 10.44 years is statistically significant during the whole consideration time. The wavelet local power spectrum of the period 19.20 years is under the 95\%\ confidence spectrum during the whole consideration time, but over the mean red-noise spectrum of $\alpha = 0.72$ before approximate Carrington rotation number 1500, and after that the filament activity does not statistically show the period. Wavelet reconstruction indicates that the early data of the filament archive (in and before cycle 16) are more noiseful than the later (in and after cycle 17).</p>

				<title>Search for Orbital Motion of the Pulsar 4U 1626-67: Candidate for a Neutron Star with a Supernova Fall-back Accretion Disk</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0175-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here results from a new search for orbital motion of the accretion powered X-ray pulsar 4U 1626-67 using two different analysis techniques. X-ray light curve obtained with the Proportional Counter Array of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer during a long observation carried out in February 1996, was used in this work. The spin period and the local period derivative were first determined from the broad 2–60 keV energy band light curve and these were used for all subsequent timing analysis. In the first technique, the orbital phase dependent pulse arrival times were determined for different trial orbital periods in the range of 500 to 10,000 s. We have determined a $3\sigma$ upper limit of 13 lt-ms on the projected semimajor axis of the orbit of the neutron star for most of the orbital period range, while in some narrow orbital period ranges, covering about 10\%\ of the total orbital period range, it is 20 lt-ms. In the second method, we have measured the pulse arrival times at intervals of 100 s over the entire duration of the observation. The pulse arrival time data were used to put an upper limit on any periodic arrival time delay using the Lomb–Scargle periodogram. We have obtained a similar upper limit of 10 lt-ms using the second method over the orbital period range of 500–10,000 s. This puts very stringent upper limits for the mass of the compact object except for the unlikely case of a complete face-on orientation of the binary system with respect to our line-of-sight. In the light of this measurement and the earlier reports, we discuss the possibility of this system being a neutron star with a supernovae fall-back accretion disk.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report here results from a study of X-ray bursts from 3 magnetar candidates (SGR 1806–20, SGR 1900+14 and AXP 1E 2259+586). We have searched for a pulse phase dependence of the X-ray burst rate from these sources. X-ray light curves were obtained with the Proportional Counter Array on-board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer during the periods of intense burst activity in these sources. On detailed analysis of the three sources, we found a very significant burst rate for all pulsar phases. However, some locations appear to produce bursts slightly more often, rendering the non-isotropic distribution.

				<title>Orbital Evolution Measurement of the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar SAX J1808.4–3658</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0197-0206</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present results from a pulse timing analysis of the accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4–3658 using X-ray data obtained during four outbursts of this source. Extensive observations were made with the proportional counter array of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) during the four outbursts that occurred in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2005. Instead of measuring the arrival times of individual pulses or the pulse arrival time delay measurement that is commonly used to determine the orbital parameters of binary pulsars, we have determined the orbital ephemeris during each observation by optimizing the pulse detection against a range of trial ephemeris values. The source exhibits a significant pulse shape variability during the outbursts. The technique used by us does not depend on the pulse profile evolution, and is therefore, different from the standard pulse timing analysis. Using 27 measurements of orbital ephemerides during the four outbursts spread over more than 7 years and more than 31,000 binary orbits, we have derived an accurate value of the orbital period of 7249.156862(5) s (MJD = 50915) and detected an orbital period derivative of $(3.14 \pm 0.21) \times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$. We have included a table of the 27 mid-eclipse time measurements of this source that will be valuable for further studies of the orbital evolution of the source, especially with ASTROSAT. We point out that the measured rate of orbital period evolution is considerably faster than the most commonly discussed mechanisms of orbital period evolution like mass transfer, mass loss from the companion star and gravitational wave radiation. The present time scale of orbital period change, 73 Myr is therefore likely to be a transient high value of period evolution and similar measurements during subsequent outbursts of SAX J1808.4–3658 will help us to resolve this.</p>

				<title>Distribution of Latitudes and Speeds of Coronal Mass Ejections in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in Cycle 23</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0207-0215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Distribution of latitudes and speeds of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) in the northern and southern hemispheres in cycle 23, from September 1996 to December 2006, have been analyzed. By calculating the actual probability of the hemispheric distribution of the activity of the CME, we find that a southern dominance of the activity of the CME is shown to occur in cycle 23 from September 1996 to December 2006. The CME activity occurs at all latitudes and is most common at low latitudes. This should furnish evidence to support that CMEs are associated with source magnetic structures on a large spatial scale, even with transequatorial source magnetic structures on a large spatial scale. The latitudinal distribution of CMEs in the northern and southern hemispheres are no different from a statistical point of view. The speed distribution in the northern and southern hemispheres are nearly identical and to a good approximation they can be fitted with a single lognormal distribution. This finding implies that, statistically, there is no physical distinction between the CME events in the southern and northern hemispheres and the same mechanism of a nonlinear nature acting in both the CME events in the northern and southern hemispheres. Our conclusions seem to suggest that the northern–southern asymmetry of the CME events is related to the northern–southern asymmetry in solar dynamo theory (Jiang <i>et al.</i> 2007).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We use the method introduced by Karami &amp; Mohebi (2007), and Karami &amp; Teimoorinia (2007) which enable us to derive the orbital parameters of the spectroscopic binary stars by the nonlinear least squares of observed $vs$. curve fitting (o–c). Using the measured experimental data for radial velocities of the four double-lined spectroscopic binary systems PV Pup, HD 141929, EE Cet and V921 Her, we find both the orbital and the combined spectroscopic elements of these systems. Our numerical results are in good agreement with those obtained using the method of Lehmann-Filhés.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Since the structuring and variability of the Sun and other stars are governed by magnetic fields, much of present-day stellar physics centers around the measurement and understanding of the magnetic fields and their interactions. The Sun, being a prototypical star, plays a unique role in astrophysics, since its proximity allows the fundamental processes to be explored in detail. The PRL anniversary gives us an opportunity to look back at past milestones and try to identify the main unsolved issues that will be addressed in the future.</p>

				<title>Global Solar Dynamo Models: Simulations and Predictions</title>

				<page>0029-0039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Flux-transport type solar dynamos have achieved considerable success in correctly simulating many solar cycle features, and are now being used for prediction of solar cycle timing and amplitude.We first define flux-transport dynamos and demonstrate how they work. The essential added ingredient in this class of models is meridional circulation, which governs the dynamo period and also plays a crucial role in determining the Sun’s memory about its past magnetic fields.We show that flux-transport dynamo models can explain many key features of solar cycles. Then we show that a predictive tool can be built from this class of dynamo that can be used to predict mean solar cycle features by assimilating magnetic field data from previous cycles.</p>

				<title>Prospects for Predicting Cycle 24</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0041-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although we have reliable data of solar polar fields only from the mid-1970s, it seems that the polar field at a minimum is well correlated with the next cycle, but the strength of the cycle is not correlated with the polar field produced at its end. We explain this by suggesting that the Babcock–Leighton mechanism of poloidal field generation from tilted active regions involves randomness, whereas the other aspects of the dynamo process are more ordered. To model actual cycles, we have to ‘correct’ our theoretical dynamo model by ‘feeding’ information about the polar field at the minima. Following this process, we find that our model fits the observed sunspot numbers of cycles 21–23 reasonably well and predicts that cycle 24 will be the weakest in a century.</p>

				<title>What Helicity Can Tell Us about Solar Magnetic Fields</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0049-0056</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Concept of magnetic/current helicity was introduced to solar physics about 15 years ago. Earlier studies led to discovery of such fundamental properties as hemispheric helicity rule, and role of helicity in magnetic reconnection and solar eruptions. Later, the concept was successfully applied in studies of different solar processes from solar dynamo to flare and CME phenomena. Although no silver bullet, helicity has proven to be a very useful “tool” in answering many still-puzzling questions about origin and evolution of solar magnetic fields. I present an overview of some helicity studies and briefly analyze their findings.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we study the evolution of vector magnetic field of AR 10656 by using the observations of Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS, China) and Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO, USA). The magnetic flux emergence and cancellation, and thus, magnetic non-potential changes, are associated with the major flares in this active region. Compared with some other super-active regions, the evolution of magnetic morphologies and non-potentialities are relatively gradual, and thus the energy transportation and release are relatively slow. This gradual process may result in the recurrent flares of AR 10656.</p>

				<title>Inductive Magnetic Footpoint Tracking by Combining the Minimum Energy Fit with the Local Correlation Tracking and Doppler Velocity</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0063-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-dependent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of active region coronal magnetic field require the underlying photospheric magnetic footpoint velocities. The minimum energy fit (MEF) is a new velocity inversion technique to infer the photospheric magnetic footpoint velocities using a pair of vector magnetograms, introduced by Longcope (2004). The MEF selects the smallest overall flow from several consistent flows by minimizing an energy functional. The inferred horizontal and vertical flow fields by the MEF can be further constrained by incorporating the partial or imperfect velocity information obtained through independent means. This hybrid method is expected to give a velocity close to the true magnetic footpoint velocity. Here, we demonstrate that a combination of the MEF, the local correlation tracking (LCT) and Doppler velocity is capable of inferring the velocity close to the photospheric flow.</p>

				<title>Prediction of Peaks inWolf Numbers in Cycle 24 according to Actual Numbers of Polar Faculae</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0069-0073</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Previous investigations by Makarov <i>et al.</i> have shown a relation between the peaks in the number of polar faculae and the peaks in the Wolf number. In cycles 20 and 22 the delay between peaks in polar faculae and Wolf number was 6.1 $\pm$ 0.1 year, north and south taken separately, as their peaks do not coincide. For the odd cycle 21, this shift was 5.6 years average. Polar faculae always <i>precede</i> the sunspots. The relevance of this for the dynamo mechanism is obvious. In cycle 23 the delay was 7.7 year (north) and 7.8 year (south). The approach of a deep minimum is probably responsible for this increased delay; thus for cycle 24 the delay between peaks of polar faculae and sunspots is expected to be at least 7.8 years and probably longer. The present polar faculae show 6 peaks above the smoothed average (north) and similarly 3 peaks south. The first peak for the sunspots will be at the earliest during the very end of 2007. As soon as one peak in the spots occurs the delay for cycle 24 can be estimated and the other peaks predicted.</p>

					<p>Magnetic field in the solar interior contributes to the even order splitting coefficients, but it is not possible to separate the effect of magnetic field from those due to other deviations from spherical symmetry. Results obtained using GONG and MDI data are discussed. Limits on possible magnetic field in the solar core and in the tachocline region are obtained. There is some signal from possible magnetic field in the convection zone, but evidence of possible temporal variation in the solar interior is only marginal.</p>

				<title>Helioseismic Effects of Energetic Transients</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0093-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photospheric and chromospheric signatures related to large, energetic transients such as flares and CMEs, have been extensively reported during the last several years. In addition, energetic solar transients are expected to cause helioseismic effects. Some of the recent results are reviewed here; in particular, the helioseismic effects of the powerful flares in superactive region, NOAA 10486, including the 4B/X17 superflare of October 28, 2003. We also examine the temporal variations of power in low-$l$ modes during the period May 1995–October 2005, and compare with daily, disk-integrated flare- and CME-indices to infer the effect of transients on the scale of whole solar disk.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study the magnetic and velocity field evolution in the two magnetically complex active regions NOAA 10486 and NOAA 10488 observed during October–November 2003.We have used the available data to examine net flux and Doppler velocity time profiles to identify changes associated with evolutionary and transient phenomena. In particular, we report detection of rapid moving features observed in NOAA 10486 during the maximum phase of the X17.2/4B superflare of October 28, 2003. The velocity of this moving feature is estimated around 40 km/s, i.e., much greater than the usual H$\alpha$ flare-ribbons’ separation speed of 3–10 km/s, but similar to the velocity of seismic waves, i.e., $\sim 45$ km/s reported earlier by Kosovichev &amp; Zharkova (1998).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS), the first space-borne solar astronomy experiment of India was designed to improve our current understanding of X-ray emission from the Sun in general and solar flares in particular. SOXS mission is composed of two solid state detectors, <i>viz</i>., Si and CZT semiconductors capable of observing the full disk Sun in X-ray energy range of 4–56 keV. The X-ray spectra of solar flares obtained by the Si detector in the 4–25 keV range show evidence of Fe and Fe/Ni line emission and multi-thermal plasma. The evolution of the break energy point that separates the thermal and non-thermal processes reveals increase with increasing flare plasma temperature. Small scale flare activities observed by both the detectors are found to be suitable to heat the active region corona; however their location appears to be in the transition region.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Regular monitoring of solar irradiance has been carried out since 1978 to show that solar total and spectral irradiance varies at different time scales. Whereas variations on time scales of minutes to hours are due to solar oscillations and granulation, variations on longer time scales are driven by the evolution of the solar surface magnetic field. Here the most recent advances in modelling of solar irradiance variations on time scales longer than a day are briefly reviewed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Sun is the primary source of energy that governs both the terrestrial climate and near-earth space environment. Variations in UV irradiances seen at earth are the sum of global (solar dynamo) to regional (active region, plage, network, bright points and background) solar magnetic activities that can be identified through spatially resolved photospheric, chromospheric and coronal features. In this research, the images of CaII K-line (NSO/Sac Peak) have been analysed to segregate the various chromospheric features.We derived the different indices and estimated their contribution from the time series data to total CaII K emission flux and UV irradiance variability. A part of the important results from this research is discussed in this paper.</p>

				<title>Wave Heating of the Solar Chromosphere</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0163-0166</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nonmagnetic interior of supergranulation cells has been thought since the 1940s to be heated by the dissipation of acoustic waves. But all attempts to measure the acoustic flux have failed to show sufficient energy for chromospheric heating. Recent space observations with TRACE, for example, have found 10\%\ or less of the necessary flux. To explain the missing energy it has been speculated that the nonmagnetic chromosphere is heated mainly by waves related to the magnetic field. If that were correct, the whole chromosphere, magnetic as well as nonmagnetic, would be heated mainly by waves related to the magnetic field. But contrary to expectation, the radiation emerging from the nonmagnetic chromosphere shows none of the signatures of magnetic waves, only those of acoustic waves. Nearly all the heating of the nonmagnetic chromosphere must therefore be due to acoustic waves. In the magnetic network on the boundary of supergranulation cells, on the other hand, the small filling factor of the magnetic field in the photosphere implies that only a small fraction of the wave flux that travels upward to heat the chromosphere can be channeled by the magnetic field. Hence, while some of the energy that is dissipated in the magnetic network is in the form of magnetic waves, most of it must be in the form of acoustic waves. Thus, the quiet solar chromosphere, instead of being heated mainly by magneticwaves throughout, must be heated mainly by acoustic waves throughout. The full wave flux heating the quiet chromosphere must travel through the photosphere. In the nonmagnetic medium, this flux is essentially all in the form of acoustic waves; TRACE registers at most 10% of it, perhaps because of limited spatial resolution.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0167-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements made with the Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory can be used to determine physical parameters in the solar corona such as hydrogen and ion kinetic temperatures, electron densities, and absolute elemental abundances. Hydrogen and ion outflow velocities can be determined by combining the UV spectroscopic measurements with white light polarized brightness measurements. These combined measurements can be used to reveal physical characteristics of coronal streamers. To date we have studied plasma properties, such as the variation of plasma outflows in quiescent streamers, primarily in classic helmet streamers at solar minimum. Outflows have not been observed in the centers of coronal streamers suggesting that these are closed magnetic field regions.We propose to study all of the coronal streamers in the UVCS synoptic dataset in order to investigate different types of streamers and their long-term evolution.</p>

					<p>We present a preliminary study of 27 microflares observed by Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS) mission during July 2003 to August 2006. We found that all 27 microflares show the Fe-line feature peaking around 6.7 keV, which is an indicator of the presence of coronal plasma temperature $\geq 9$ MK. On the other hand, the spectra of microflares showhybrid model of thermal and non-thermal emission, which further supports them as possible sources of coronal heating. Our results based on the analysis show that the energy relapsed by the microflares is good enough for heating of the active corona. We discuss our results in the light of the hybrid model of microflares production.</p>

				<title>X-ray Emission Characteristics of Flares Associated with CMEs</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0195-0205</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the study of 20 solar flares observed by “Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS)” mission during November 2003 to December 2006 and found associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) seen by LASCO/SOHO mission. In this investigation, X-ray emission characteristics of solar flares and their relationship with the dynamics of CMEs have been presented.We found that the fast moving CMEs, i.e., positive acceleration are better associated with short rise time ($\lt 150$ s) flares. However, the velocity of CMEs increases as a function of duration of the flares in both 4.1–10 and 10–20 keV bands. This indicates that the possibility of association of CMEs with larger speeds exists with long duration flare events. We observed that CMEs decelerate with increasing rise time, decay time and duration of the associated X-ray flares. A total 10 out of 20 CMEs under current investigation showed positive acceleration, and 5 of them whose speed did not exceed 589 km/s were associated with short rise time ($\lt 150$ s) and short duration ($\lt 1300$ s) flares. The other 5 CMEs were associated with long duration or large rise time flare events. The unusual feature of all these positive accelerating CMEs was their low linear speed ranging between 176 and 775 km/s. We do not find any significant correlation between X-ray peak intensity of the flares with linear speed as well as acceleration of the associated CMEs. Based on the onset time of flares and associated CMEs within the observing cadence of CMEs by LASCO, we found that in 16 cases CME preceded the flare by 23 to 1786 s, while in 4 cases flare occurred before the CME by 47 to 685 s. We argue that both events are closely associated with each other and are integral parts of one energy release system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We apply the ring diagram technique to source regions of halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to study changes in acoustic mode parameters before, during, and after the onset of CMEs.We find that CME regions associated with a low value of magnetic flux have line widths smaller than the quiet regions, implying a longer life-time for the oscillation modes. We suggest that this criterion may be used to forecast the active regions which may trigger CMEs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss needs in dielectronic recombination data motivated by recent work directed at a quantitative understanding of ion charge states of various elements observed in situ in the solar wind and CMEs. The competing processes of ionization and recombination lead to departures from collision ionization equilibrium. The use of this as a diagnostic of acceleration and heating processes of the solar wind and CMEs is sensitive to the accuracy of the atomic rates in a way that steady state ionization equilibrium plasmas are not. The most pressing need is dielectronic recombination rates for ions Fe8+$-$12+. These are among the dominant species observed in various regions of the solar wind and CMEs, and in remotely sensed EUV spectra.</p>

				<title>The Solar Wind: Our Current Understanding and How We Got Here</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0217-0237</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the original theory for the solar wind, the electron pressure gradient was the principal accelerating force. This was soon recognized to be insufficient to drive the high-speed streams. Subsequently, the discovery of Alfvén waves in the solar wind led to a long series of models in which wave pressure provided additional acceleration, but these wave-driven models ultimately failed to explain the rapid acceleration of the fast wind close to the Sun. An alternate viewwas that the pressure of hot protons close to the Sun could explain the rapid acceleration, with the proton heating coming from the cyclotron resonance. SOHO has provided remarkable data which have verified some of the predictions of this view, and given impetus to ongoing studies of the ion-cyclotron resonance in the fast wind. After a historical review, we discuss the basic ideas behind current research, emphasizing the importance of particle kinetics. We conclude with some guesses as to how work might proceed in the future.</p>

				<title>Damping of Slow Magnetoacoustic Waves in an Inhomogeneous Coronal Plasma</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0243-0248</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study the propagation and dissipation of slow magnetoacoustic waves in an inhomogeneous viscous coronal loop plasma permeated by uniform magnetic field. Only viscosity and thermal conductivity are taken into account as dissipative processes in the coronal loop. The damping length of slow-mode waves exhibit varying behaviour depending upon the physical parameters of the loop in an active region AR8270 observed by TRACE. The wave energy flux associated with slow magnetoacoustic waves turns out to be of the order of $10^{6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ which is high enough to replace the energy lost through optically thin coronal emission and the thermal conduction belowto the transition region. It is also found that only those slow-mode waves which have periods more than 240 s provide the required heating rate to balance the energy losses in the solar corona. Our calculated wave periods for slow-mode waves nearly match with the oscillation periods of loop observed by TRACE.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0253-0256</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the fundamental questions in solar physics is how the solar corona maintains its high temperature of several million Kelvin above photosphere with a temperature of 6000 K.</p>
					<p>Observations show that solar coronal heating problem is highly complex with many different facts. It is likely that different heating mechanisms are at work in the solar corona. The separate kinds of coronal loops may also be heated by different mechanisms.</p>
					<p>Using data from instruments onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and from the more recent Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) scientists have identified small regions of mixed polarity, termed magnetic carpet contributing to solar activity on a short time scale.</p>
					<p>Magnetic loops of all sizes rise into the solar corona, arising from regions of opposite magnetic polarity in the photosphere. Energy released when oppositely directed magnetic fields meet in the corona is one likely cause for coronal heating. There is enough energy coming up from the loops of the “magnetic carpet” to heat the corona to its known temperature.</p>

				<title>Multi-parametric Effect of Solar Activity on Cosmic Rays</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0257-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The long-term modulation of cosmic ray intensity (CRI) by different solar activity (SA) parameters and an inverse correlation between individual SA parameter and CRI is well known. Earlier, it has been suggested that the concept of multi-parametric modulation of CRI may play an important role in the study of long-term modulation of CRI. In the present study, we have tried to investigate the combined effect of a set of two SA parameters in the long-term modulation of CRI. For this purpose, we have used a new statistical technique called “Running multiple correlation method”, based on the “Running cross correlation method”. The running multiple correlation functions among different sets of two SA parameters (e.g., sunspot numbers and solar flux, sunspot numbers and coronal index, sunspot numbers and grouped solar flares, etc.) and CRI have been correlated separately. It is found that the strength of multiple correlation (among two SA parameters and CRI) and cross correlation (between individual SA parameter and CRI) is almost similar throughout the period of investigation (1955–2005). It is also found that the multiple correlations among various SA parameters and CRI is stronger during ascending and descending phases of the solar cycles and it becomes weaker during maxima and minima of the solar cycles, which is in accordance with the linear relationship between SA parameters and CRI. The values of multiple correlation functions among different sets of SA parameters and CRI fall well within the 95\%\ confidence interval. In the view of odd–even hypothesis of solar cycles, the strange behaviour of present cycle 23 (odd cycle), as this is characterized by many peculiarities with double peaks and many quiet periods (Gnevyshev gaps) interrupted the solar activity (for example April 2001, October–November 2003 and January 2005), leads us to speculate that the solar cycle 24 (even cycle) might be of exceptional nature.</p>

				<title>Solar and Interplanetary Disturbances causing Moderate Geomagnetic Storms</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0263-0267</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of solar and interplanetary disturbances on geomagnetospheric conditions leading to 121 moderate geomagnetic storms (MGS) have been investigated using the neutron monitor, solar geophysical and interplanetary data during the period 1978–99. Further, the duration of recovery phase has been observed to be greater than the duration of main phase in most of the cases of MGS. It has further been noted that Ap-index increases on sudden storm commencement (SSC) day than its previous day value and acquires maximum value on the day of maximum solar activity. Generally, the decrease in cosmic ray (CR) intensity and Dst begins few hours earlier than the occurrence of MGS at Earth. Furthermore, negative Bz pointing southward plays a key causal role in the occurrence of MGS and the magnitude and the duration of Bz and Bav also play a significant role in the development of MGS. The solar features H$\alpha$, X-ray solar flares and active prominences and disappearing filaments (APDFs) which have occurred within lower helio-latitudinal/helio-longitudinal zones produce larger number of MGS. Solar flares seem to be the major cause for producing MGS.</p>

				<title>Effect of Magnetic Activity on Ionospheric Time Delay at Low Latitude</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of magnetic activity on ionospheric time delay at low latitude Station Bhopal (geom. lat. 23.2$^{\circ}$N, geom. long. 77.6$^{\circ}$E) using dual frequency (1575.42 and 1227.60 MHz) GPS measurements. Data from GSV4004A GPS Ionospheric Scintillation and TEC monitor (GISTM) have been chosen to study these effects. This paper presents the results of ionospheric time delay during quiet and disturbed days for the year 2005. Results show that maximum delay is observed during quiet days in equinoxial month while the delays of disturbed period are observed during the months of winter. We also study the ionospheric time delay during magnetic storm conditions for the same period. Results do not show any clear relationship either with the magnitude of the geomagnetic storm or with the main phase onset (MPO) of the storm. But most of the maximum ionospheric time delay variations are observed before the main phase onset (MPO) or sudden storm commencement (SSC) as compared to storm days.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the effect of geomagnetic storm on geomagnetic field components at Southern (Maitri) and Northern (Kiruna) Hemispheres. The Indian Antarctic Station Maitri is located at geom. long. $66.03^{\circ}$ S; $53.21^{\circ}$ E whereas Kiruna is located at geom. long. $67.52^{\circ}$ N; $23.38^{\circ}$ E. We have studied all the geomagnetic storms that occurred during winter season of the year 2004–2005. We observed that at Southern Hemisphere the variation is large as compared to the Northern Hemisphere. Geomagnetic field components vary when the interplanetary magnetic field is oriented in southward direction. Geomagnetic field components vary in the main phase of the ring current. Due to southward orientation of vertical component of IMF reconnection takes place all across the dayside that transports plasma and magnetic flux which create the geomagnetic field variation.</p>

					<p>A fluxgate digital magnetometer is used to study the variation of magnitude of H component during geomagnetic storm events of April, July and November 2004 at southern subauroral localized region at “MAITRI” (geom. lat. $62^{\circ}$S, long. $52.8^{\circ}$E). We also study the effect of vertical component of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) on the variation of the magnitude of H component during storm time of April, July and November 2004. Results show that before sudden storm commencement (SSC) time magnitude ofHcomponent and IMF showsmooth variation but after SSC of first storm of 22 July 2004, the magnitude of the H component shows fluctuations and at 09:00 UT it increases, but during second storm of 24 July 2004, the magnitude of H component indicates large fluctuations and it increases rapidly at 04:00 UT.</p>

				<title>Geo-effectiveness of CMEs</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0287-0291</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are important phenomena in coronal dynamics causing interplanetary signatures (ICMEs). They eject large amounts of mass and magnetic fields into the heliosphere, causing major geomagnetic storms and interplanetary shocks. Geomagnetic storms are often characterized by abrupt increases in the northward component of the earth’s field, called sudden commencements (SSC) followed by large decreases of the magnetic field and slow recovery to normal values. The SSCs are well correlated with IP shocks. Here a case study of 10–15 February 2000 and also the statistical study of CME events observed by IPS array, Rajkot, during the years 2000 to 2003 and Radio Astronomy Center, Ooty are described. The geomagnetic storm index Dst, which is a measure of geo-effectiveness, is shown to be well correlated with normalized scintillation index ‘g’, derived from Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) observations.</p>

				<title>Relationship between Interplanetary (IP) Parameters and Geomagnetic Indices during IP Shock Events of 2005</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0293-0302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we investigate the possible relationship of IP parameters of solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field with ground-based geomagnetic indices. To carry out the study, we take all the IP shock events listed by Proton Monitor onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) during 2005, and plot the time variations of all the IP parameters and geomagnetic parameters ($\pm$5 days), centered at the shock arrival time. Next, we obtain scatter plots of absolute values of solar wind parameters such as Vsw, Nsw and Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) components Bx, By, Bz and total B with the values of geomagnetic parameters such as Dst, Kp indices, dayside Magnetopause (MP) distance and Cosmic-Ray Neutron Monitor count (CRNM). The scatter plots show that before the IP shock, the pattern is random with no clear relationship. Following the shock, a clear pattern emerges with a type of relationship being seen – clear for SHARP shocks and less clear for DIFFUSE shocks. A total of 10 shock events for 2005 have been studied. Typical examples of this behaviour are the shock events of January 21, 2005 and May 15, 2005.</p>
					<p>Our study suggests a definite correlation between changes in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters and ground-based geomagnetic response. We are trying to obtain quantitative relationships between these for shock events of 2005.</p>

				<title>Multipoint Observations of Low Latitude ULF Pc3 Waves in South-East Australia</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0303-0311</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geomagnetic pulsations recorded on the ground are the signatures of the integrated signals from the magnetosphere. Pc3 geomagnetic pulsations are quasi-sinusoidal variations in the earth’s magnetic field in the period range 10–45 seconds. The magnitude of these pulsations ranges from fraction of a nT (nano Tesla) to several nT. These pulsations can be observed in a number of ways. However, the application of ground-based magnetometer arrays has proven to be one of the most successful methods of studying the spatial structure of hydromagnetic waves in the earth’s magnetosphere. The solar wind provides the energy for the earth’s magnetospheric processes. Pc3-5 geomagnetic pulsations can be generated either externally or internally with respect to the magnetosphere. The Pc3 studies undertaken in the past have been confined to middle and high latitudes. The spatial and temporal variations observed in Pc3 occurrence are of vital importance because they provide evidence which can be directly related to wave generation mechanisms both inside and external to the magnetosphere. At low latitudes (L $\lt$ 3) wave energy predominates in the Pc3 band and the spatial characteristics of these pulsations have received little attention in the past. An array of four low latitude induction coil magnetometers were established in south-east Australia over a longitudinal range of 17 degrees at L = 1.8 to 2.7 for carrying out the study of the effect of the solar wind velocity on these pulsations. Digital dynamic spectra showing Pc3 pulsation activity over a period of about six months have been used to evaluate Pc3 pulsation occurrence. Pc3 occurrence probability at low latitudes has been found to be dominant for the solar wind velocity in the range 400–700 km/s. The results suggest that solar wind controls Pc3 occurrence through a mechanism in which Pc3 wave energy is convected through the magnetosheath and coupled to the standing oscillations of magnetospheric field lines.</p>

				<title>Energy Dependence of Near-relativistic Electron Spectrum at Geostationary Orbit during the SEP Events of 2005</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0313-0317</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In view of the renewed interest in the study of energetic particles in the outer radiation belt of the earth, we feel it will be helpful in looking for the energy dependence of the electron energy spectrum at geostationary orbit. This may give us some insight into how we can safeguard geostationary satellites from functional anomalies of the deep dielectric charging type, which are caused by charge accumulation and subsequent discharge of relativistic electrons. In this study we examine whether there is any energy dependence in relativistic electron enhancements at geosynchronous altitudes during solar energetic proton events of 2005.</p>

				<title>Next Generation UV Coronagraph Instrumentation for Solar Cycle-24</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0321-0327</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ultraviolet coronagraph observations of the extended solar corona (defined here as 1.5 to 10 solar radii from Sun-center) have become a powerful tool for obtaining detailed empirical descriptions of coronal holes, streamers, and coronal mass ejections. The empirical models resulting from ultraviolet coronagraph observations provide the constraints needed to test and guide theoretical models aimed at determining the physical processes that control solar wind acceleration, CME heating and acceleration, and solar energetic particle (SEP) acceleration. Measurements to date from sounding rockets, the shuttle deployed Spartan 201 satellite and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) have utilized high resolution spectroscopy over a very limited instantaneous field of view. New concepts for next generation instrumentation include imaging ultraviolet spectrocoronagraphs and large aperture ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometers. An imaging instrument would be the first to obtain absolute spectral line intensities of the extended corona over a wide field of view. Such images would provide the absolute intensities of spectral lines that can be used to determine densities and outflow velocities of specific coronal ions. Measurements from several charge states of a given element will allow electron temperatures to be determined. These measurements combined with observations of H I Ly$\alpha$ provide absolute chemical abundances (relative to hydrogen) for observed elements. Ultraviolet imaging would be highly complementary to a large-aperture ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer designed for high spectral resolution observations over a small instantaneous field of view. The images would be used to select targets for more detailed spectroscopic studies with the large aperture UV coronagraph spectrometer and to provide time dependent empirical descriptions of the regions surrounding the narrow instantaneous field of view of the large aperture instrument. Descriptions of both the imaging ultraviolet spectrocoronagraph and the large aperture ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer are provided. Recommended co-observing instruments are described.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sun’s atmosphere is an ideal place to study and test many magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes controlling turbulent plasma. We wish to resolve some of the finest solar features (which remain unresolved presently) and study their dynamics. Indian Institute of Astrophysics has proposed to design, fabricate and install a 2-meter class solar telescope at a suitable site in India to resolve features on the Sun of the size of about 0.1 arcsec. The focal plane instruments will include a high resolution polarimeteric package to measure polarization with an accuracy of 0.01 per cent; a high spectral resolution spectrograph to obtain spectra in 5 widely separated absorption lines simultaneously and high spatial resolution narrow band imagers in various lines. The Himalayan region appears to be a good choice keeping in view the prevailing dry and clear weather conditions. We have started detailed analysis of the weather conditions in the area and at some other locations in India. The site characterization will be done using the Sun-photometer, S-DIMM and SHABAR techniques to determine the seeing conditions.</p>

					<p>A low-order Adaptive Optics (AO) system is being developed at the Udaipur Solar Observatory and we present in this paper the status of the project, which includes the image stabilization system and calibration of wavefront sensor and deformable mirror. The image stabilization system comprises of a piezo driven tip-tilt mirror, a high speed camera (955 fps), a frame grabber system for sensing the overall tilt and a Linux based Intel Pentium 4 control computer with Red Hat Linux OS. The system operates under PID control. In the closed loop, an rms image motion of 0.1–0.2 arcsec was observed with the improvement factor varying from 10–20 depending on the external conditions. Error rejection bandwidth of the system at 0 dB is 80–100 Hz. In addition to that, we report the on-going efforts in the calibration of lenslet array and deformable mirror for sensing and correcting the local tilt of the wavefront.</p>

				<title>CONCEPTUAL PAPER : Utilization of GPS Satellites for Precise Irradiation Measurement and Monitoring</title>
				<feature>Special Issue : Proceedings of the International Conference on "Challenges for Solar - 24"</feature>
				<page>0359-0361</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Precise measurement of irradiance over the earth under various circumstances like solar flares, coronal mass ejections, over an 11-year solar cycle, etc. leads to better understanding of Sun–earth relationship. To continuously monitor the irradiance over earth-space regions several satellites at several positions are required. For that continuous and multiple satellite monitoring we can use GPS (Global Positioning System) satellites (like GLONASS, GALILEO, future satellites) installed with irradiance measuring and monitoring instruments. GPS satellite system consists of 24 constellations of satellites. Therefore usage of all the satellites leads to 24 measurements of irradiance at the top of the atmosphere (or 12 measurements of those satellites which are pointing towards the Sun) at an instant. Therefore in one day, numerous irradiance observations can be obtained for the whole globe, which will be very helpful for several applications like Albedo calculation, Earth Radiation Budget calculation, monitoring of near earth-space atmosphere, etc. Moreover, measuring irradiance both in ground (using ground instruments) and in space at the same instant of time over a same place, leads to numerous advantages. That is, for a single position we obtain irradiance at the top of the atmosphere, irradiance at ground and the difference in irradiance from over top of the atmosphere to the ground. Measurement of irradiance over the atmosphere and in ground at a precise location gives more fine details about the solar irradiance influence over the earth, path loss and interaction of irradiance with the atmosphere.</p>

				<title>Error Minimization of Polynomial Approximation of Delta $T$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0363-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The difference between Universal time (UT) and Dynamical time (TD), known as Delta $T(\Delta T)$ is tabulated for the first day of each year in the Astronomical Almanac. During the last four centuries it is found that there are large differences between its values for two consecutive years. Polynomial approximations have been developed to obtain the values of $\Delta T$ for any time of a year for the period AD 1620 to AD 2000 (Meeu 2000) as no dynamical theories describe the variations in $\Delta T$. In this work, a new set of polynomials for $\Delta T$ is obtained for the period AD 1620 to AD 2007 that is found to produce better results compared to previous attempts.</p>

				<title>Investigation of the Effects of Expectation Values for Radii on the Determination of Transition Probabilities using WBEPM Theory</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0367-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Transition probabilities for some excited s–p and p–s transition arrays of neutral nitrogen have been calculated using the weakest bound electron potential model theory (WBEPMT) for the investigation of effects of expectation values of radii.We have used both numerical non-relativistic Hartree-Fock (NRHF) wave functions and numerical Coulomb approximation (NCA) wave functions to calculate expectation values of radii. The transition probability results obtained using the parameters determined with two different wave functions agree well with each other and accepted values taken from NIST for low values of transition probability. However, the NRHF wave functions present better results for p–s transitions, while NCA wave functions are better in s–p transitions for large values of transition probability.</p>

				<title>Observational Evidences for Multi-component Magnetic Field Structure in Solar Flares</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0387-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two solar flares of 25 July 1981 and 5 November 2004 of importance $2N$ and M4.1/1B, respectively, were investigated using observational data obtained with the Echelle spectrograph of the Kyiv University Astronomical Observatory. Stokes $I$ and $V$ profiles of the FeI lines 5233, 5247.1, 5250.2, 5250.6, 5576.1 and of CrI 5247.6 Å have been analyzed. We found several evidences for the existence of spatially unresolved magnetic field structures with kG strengths. In particular, the values of the measured average longitudinal field $B_{\parallel}$ depend on the Lande factors $g$ of the lines: in general, $B_{\parallel}$ increases with increasing factor $g$. Analogously, the observed line ratio $B_{\parallel}(5250.2)/B_{\parallel}(5247.1)$ is increasing with increasing distance $\Delta \gamma$ from the line center. The observed Stokes $V$ profiles show some deviations from that of an assumed homogeneous field, presented by the Stokes $I$ gradient, $dI/d\gamma$. A comparison with the non-split line FeI 5576.1 Å shows that some of these deviations are real and indicate the presence of subtelescopic magnetic elements with discrete field strengths of several kG. The lines with large Lande factors have considerable broadenings of the Stokes $I$ profiles, indicating a strong background magnetic field of mixed polarity. On the basis of all these data we conclude that a four-component magnetic field structure is a possible explanation. The field strengths are about $\pm 1.05$ kG in the background field, and 1.3–1.5, 3.9–4.0, and 7.4–7.8 kG at level of middle photosphere ($h \approx 300$ km) in the spatially unresolved, small-scale magnetic elements.</p>

				<title>The Fate of Dwarf Galaxies in Clusters and the Origin of Intracluster Stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main goal of this paper is to compare the relative importance of destruction by tides vs. destruction by mergers, in order to assess if tidal destruction of galaxies in clusters is a viable scenario for explaining the origin of intracluster stars. We have designed a simple algorithm for simulating the evolution of isolated clusters. The distribution of galaxies in the cluster is evolved using a direct gravitational $N$-body algorithm combined with a subgrid treatment of physical processes such as mergers, tidal disruption, and galaxy harassment. Using this algorithm, we have performed a total of 148 simulations. Our main results are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>destruction of dwarf galaxies by mergers dominates over destruction by tides, and</li>
						<li>the destruction of galaxies by tides is sufficient to explain the observed intracluster light in clusters.</li>

				<title>GMRT Detection of a New Wide-Angle Tail (WAT) Radio Source Associated with the Galaxy PGC 1519010</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the serendipitous detection of a Wide-Angle Tail (WAT) radio galaxy at 240 and 610 MHz, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). This WAT is hosted by a cD galaxy PGC 1519010 whose photometric redshift given in the SDSS DR6 catalogue is close to the spectroscopic redshifts (0.105, 0.106 and 0.107) of three galaxies found within $4'$ of the cD. Using the SDSS DR6, we have identified a total of 37 galaxies within $15'$ of the cD, whose photometric redshifts are between 0.08 and 0.14. This strongly suggests that the cD is associated with a group of galaxies whose conspicuous feature is a north–south chain of galaxies (filament) extending to at least 2.6 Mpc. The <i>ROSAT</i> all-sky survey shows a faint, diffuse X-ray source in this direction, which probably marks the hot intracluster gas in the potential well of this group.</p>
					<p>We combine the radio structural information for this WAT with the galaxy clustering in that region to check its overall consistency with the models of WAT formation. The bending of the jet before and after its disruption forming the radio plume, are found to be correlated in this WAT, as seen from the contrasting morphological patterns on the two sides of the core. Probable constraints imposed by this on the models ofWAT formation are pointed out. We also briefly report on the other interesting radio sources found in the proximity of the WAT. These include a highly asymmetric double radio source and an ultra-steep spectrum radio source for which no optical counterpart is detected in the SDSS.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The propagation of a spherical shock wave in an ideal gas with heat conduction and radiation heat-flux, and with or without self-gravitational effects, is investigated. The initial density of the gas is assumed to obey a power law. The heat conduction is expressed in terms of Fourier’s law and the radiation is considered to be of the diffusion type for an optically thick grey gas model. The thermal conductivity and the absorption coefficient are assumed to vary with temperature and density, and the total energy of the wave to vary with time. Similarity solutions are obtained and the effects of variation of the heat transfer parameters, the variation of initial density and the presence of self-gravitational field are investigated.</p>

				<title>Predicting Maximum Sunspot Number in Solar Cycle 24</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0071-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A few prediction methods have been developed based on the precursor technique which is found to be successful for forecasting the solar activity. Considering the geomagnetic activity $aa$ indices during the descending phase of the preceding solar cycle as the precursor, we predict the maximum amplitude of annual mean sunspot number in cycle 24 to be $111 \pm 21$. This suggests that the maximum amplitude of the upcoming cycle 24 will be less than cycles 21–22. Further, we have estimated the annual mean geomagnetic activity $aa$ index for the solar maximum year in cycle 24 to be $20.6\pm 4.7$ and the average of the annual mean sunspot number during the descending phase of cycle 24 is estimated to be $48 \pm 16.8$.</p>

				<page>0079-0085</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Space observations of solar flares such as those from Yohkoh, SOHO,TRACE, and RHESSI have revealed a lot of observational evidence of magnetic reconnection in solar flares: cusp-shaped arcades, reconnection inflows, plasmoids, etc. Thus it has been established, at least phenomenologically, that magnetic reconnection does occur in solar flares. However, a number of fundamental questions and puzzles still remain in the physics of reconnection in solar flares. In this paper, we discuss the recent progresses and future prospects in the study of magnetic reconnection in solar flares from both theoretical and observational points of view.</p>

					<p>About 25 years ago, in Paper 12 of this series, the author presented a spectroscopic orbit for 6 Boo. The velocity amplitude of little more than 1 km s$^{-1}$ was much smaller than for any star whose orbit had been determined up till that time. Although it was objectively demonstrated that the orbit was very secure, a few years ago subjective misgivings prompted the author to restore the star to his observing programme. Newobservations of much higher precision confirm not only the spectroscopic-binary nature of 6 Boo but also, with almost astonishing fidelity, the elements already given for it.</p>

				<title>The Ks-band Tully–Fisher Relation – A Determination of the Hubble Parameter from 218 ScI Galaxies and 16 Galaxy Clusters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0093-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The value of Hubble parameter (H$_{0}$) is determined using the morphologically type dependent Ks-band Tully–Fisher Relation (K-TFR). The slope and zero point are determined using 36 calibrator galaxies with ScI morphology. Calibration distances are adopted from direct Cepheid distances, and group or companion distances derived with the Surface Brightness Fluctuation Method or Type Ia Supernova. It is found that a small morphological type effect is present in the K-TFR such that ScI galaxies are more luminous at a given rotational velocity than Sa/Sb galaxies and Sbc/Sc galaxies of later luminosity classes. Distances are determined to 16 galaxy clusters and 218 ScI galaxies with minimum distances of 40.0 Mpc. From the 16 galaxy clusters a weighted mean Hubble parameter of $\text{H}_{0} = 84.2 \pm 6$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ is found. From the 218 ScI galaxies a Hubble parameter of $\text{H}_{0} = 83.4 \pm 8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ is found. When the zero point of K-TFR is corrected to account for recent results that find a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus of $18.39\pm 0.05$, a Hubble parameter of $88.0 \pm 6$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ is found. Effects from Malmquist bias are shown to be negligible in this sample as galaxies are restricted to a minimum rotational velocity of 150 km s$^{-1}$. It is also shown that the results of this study are negligibly affected by the adopted slope for the K-TFR, inclination binning, and distance binning. A comparison with the results of the Hubble Key Project (Freedman <i>et al.</i> 2001) is made. Discrepancies between the K-TFR distances and the HKP I-TFR distances are discussed. Implications for $\Lambda$-CDM cosmology are considered with $\text{H}_{0} = 84$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. It is concluded that it is very difficult to reconcile the value of H$_{0}$ found in this study with ages of the oldest globular clusters and matter density of the universe derived from galaxy clusters in the context of $\Lambda$-CDM cosmology.</p>

				<title>The Effect of Hypothetical Diproton Stability on the Universe</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0119-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By calculation of the proton–proton capture cross-section, it is shown that the existence of a bound diproton state would not lead to significant production of diprotons during big bang nucleosynthesis, contrary to popular belief. In typical stellar interiors, the stability of diprotons would lead to a reaction pathway for converting protons to deuterons perhaps $\sim 10^{10}$ times faster than the usual weak capture reaction. This would prevent stars of the familiar hot, dense type from occurring in the universe. However, if diproton stability is achieved by an increase in the low-energy strong coupling, $g_{s}$ , then stars with temperatures and densities sufficiently reduced so as to offset the faster reaction pathway to deuterium will appear to meet elementary stability criteria. The claim that there is a fine-tuned, anthropic upper bound to the strong force which ensures diproton instability therefore appears to be unfounded.</p>

				<title>Close Separation Triple System QSO 1009-0252 with Discordant Redshifts: Is the Spectrum of One Component Blueshifted?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0133-0143</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>1009-0252 is a Quasi Stellar Object (QSO) with three components A, B, C. A, B are thought to be the result of gravitational lensing of one object, and A, C constitute a close pair with redshifts 2.74 and 1.62 respectively. Close separation pairs of QSOs with discordant redshifts have received special attention in recent years, probably because of the possibility that they may be physically associated, implying non-cosmological redshifts. Attempts have been made to explain their occurrences due to the effect of gravitational lensing. However, gravitational lensing has not offered a completely satisfactory explanation for this triplet. Furthermore, examination revealed some inadequacies and inconsistencies in the redshift identification of the observed lines in the component A. Observational results of 1009-0252 therefore remain puzzling.We propose an alternative explanation by suggesting that A, B actually constitute a close pair and C is an unrelated object in the field. We show that the observed spectrum of A can be interpreted as blueshifted. This implies that A, B are two separate objects, one (A) approaching us and the other (B) receding from us, and are not the result of gravitational lensing of a single object. The oppositely directed pair A, B may have been ejected due to the merger of two galaxies.</p>

					<p>This paper provides a method for judging growth or decay of the magnetic field of pulsar by using pulse period $P$, or frequency $v$, and its first and second derivatives $\dot{P}$, $\ddot{P}$ or $\dot{v}$, $\ddot{v}$. The author uses this method to judge the growth or decay of the magnetic field of Crab pulsar. The judged result for Crab pulsar is that the magnetic field of Crab pulsar is growing now, but it is not decaying. The result corresponds with the actual case of Crab pulsar.</p>

				<title>Rapid Neutron Capture Process in Supernovae and Chemical Element Formation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0165-0175</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rapid neutron capture process (r-process) is one of the major nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the synthesis of heavy nuclei beyond iron. Isotopes beyond Fe are most exclusively formed in neutron capture processes and more heavier ones are produced by the r-process. Approximately half of the heavy elements with mass number A $\succ$ 70 and all of the actinides in the solar system are believed to have been produced in the r-process. We have studied the r-process in supernovae for the production of heavy elements beyond $A = 40$ with the newest mass values available. The supernova envelopes at a temperature $\succ 10^{9}$ K and neutron density of $10^{24}$ cm$^{-3}$ are considered to be one of the most potential sites for the r-process. The primary goal of the r-process calculations is to fit the global abundance curve for solar system r-process isotopes by varying time dependent parameters such as temperature and neutron density. This method aims at comparing the calculated abundances of the stable isotopes with observation.We have studied the r-process path corresponding to temperatures ranging from $1.0 \times 10^{9}$ K to $3.0 \times 10^{9}$ K and neutron density ranging from $10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $10^{30}$ cm$^{-3}$. With temperature and density conditions of $3.0 \times 10^{9}$ K and $10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ a nucleus of mass 273 was theoretically found corresponding to atomic number 115. The elements obtained along the r-process path are compared with the observed data at all the above temperature and density range.</p>

					<p>We have investigated the out of plane equilibrium points of a passive micron size particle and their stability in the field of radiating binary stellar systems <i>Krüger</i>-60, <i>RW-Monocerotis</i> within the framework of photo-gravitational circular restricted three-body problem. We find that the out of plane equilibrium points $(L_{i}, i = 6, 7, 8, 9)$ may exist for range of $\beta_{1}$ (ratio of radiation to gravitational force of the massive component) values for these binary systems in the presence of Poynting–Robertson drag (hereafter PR-drag). In the absence of PR-drag, we find that the motion of a particle near the equilibrium points $L_{6,7}$ is stable in both the binary systems for a specific range of $\beta_{1}$ values. The PR-drag is shown to cause instability of the various out of plane equilibrium points in these binary systems.</p>

				<page>0187-0205</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present work is concerned with the two-body problem with varying mass in case of isotropic mass loss from both components of the binary systems. The law of mass variation used gives rise to a perturbed Keplerian problem depending on two small parameters. The problem is treated analytically in the Hamiltonian frame-work and the equations of motion are integrated using the Lie series developed and applied, separately by Delva (1984) and Hanslmeier (1984). A second order theory of the two bodies eject mass is constructed, returning the terms of the rate of change of mass up to second order in the small parameters of the problem.</p>

				<title>Computational Developments for Distance Determination of Stellar Groups</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we consider a statistical method for distance determination of stellar groups. The method depends on the assumption that the members of the group scatter around a mean absolute magnitude in Gaussian distribution. The mean apparent magnitude of the members is then expressed by frequency function, so as to correct for observational incompleteness at the faint end. The problem reduces to the solution of a highly transcendental equation for a given magnitude parameter $\alpha$. For the computational developments of the problem, continued fraction by the Top–Down algorithm was developed and applied for the evaluation of the error function erf$(z)$. The distance equation $\Lambda(y) = 0$ was solved by an iterative method of second order of convergence using homotopy continuation technique. This technique does not need any prior knowledge of the initial guess, a property which avoids the critical situations between divergent and very slow convergent solutions, that may exist in the applications of other iterative methods depending on initial guess.</p>
					<p>Finally, we apply the method for the nearby main sequence late type stars assuming that the stars of each group of the same spectral type scatter around a mean absolute magnitude in a Gaussian distribution. The accuracies of the numerical results are satisfactory, in that, the percentage errors between $r$ and the mean values are respectively: (2.4\%, 1.6\%, 0.72\%, 0.66\%, 3.5\%, 2.4\%, 2\%, 2.5\%, 0.9\%) for the stars of spectral types: (F5V, F6V, F7V, F8V, F9V, G0V, G2V, G5V, G8V).</p>

				<title>Three-Component Dust Models for Interstellar Extinction</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0029</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Interstellar extinction curves obtained from the ‘extinction without standard’ method were used to constrain the dust characteristics in the mean ISM $(R_{V} = 3.1)$, along the lines of sight through a high latitude diffuse molecular cloud towards HD 210121 $(RV = 2.1)$ and in a dense interstellar environment towards the cluster NGC 1977 $(R_{V} = 6.42)$. We have used three-component dust models comprising silicate, graphite and very small carbonaceous grains (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) following the grain size distributions introduced by Li &amp; Draine in 2001. It is shown that oxygen, carbon and silicon abundances derived from our models are closer with the available elemental abundances for the dust grains in the ISM if F &amp; G type stars atmospheric abundances are taken for the ISM than the solar. The importance of very small grains in modelling the variation of interstellar extinction curves has been investigated. Grain size distributions and elemental abundances locked up in dust are studied and compared at different interstellar environments using these three extinction curves. We present the albedo and the scattering asymmetry parameter evaluated from optical to extreme-UV wavelengths for the proposed dust models.</p>

				<title>Spectroscopic Study of ‘CO’ and its Isotopic mm/Submillimeter Lines from Dark Cloud Lynds 183</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0031-0041</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have made spectral line analysis of CO and its isotopic lines from dark cloud Lynds 183 (L183). Our dataset incorporates $^{12}$CO(1––0), $^{13}$CO(1––0) and $^{13}$CO(2––1) lines using NRAO-12m and $^{12}$CO(3––2), $^{13}$CO(3––2) lines using CSO-10m telescopes, respectively. Observations suggest steep north-south (direction with respect to the offset position (0, 0)) temperature gradient in the cloud. These are likely to be caused by non-uniform, Inter Stellar Radiation Field (ISRF) illumination due to the shadow of nearby L134 cloud complex. As the emission of radiation depends on local properties like density and kinetic temperature, the present study attempts to deduce the irradiation contrast (and the resulting temperature difference) using 1D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RATRAN. The model results accord with the observed data and shows a temperature difference of $\sim 7$ K mainly within the cloud envelope. This results in a non-uniform intensity distribution of both CO and its species.</p>

				<title>Electron Temperatures in W51 Complex from High Resolution, Low Frequency Radio Observations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0043-0058</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>W51 is a giant radio complex lying along the tangent to the Sagitarius arm at a distance of about 7 kpc from the Sun, with an extension of about $1^{\circ}$ in the sky. It is divided into three components A, B, C where W51A and W51B consist of many compact HII regions while W51C is a supernova remnant. We have made continuum radio observations of these HII regions of the W51 complex at 240, 610, 1060 and 1400 MHz using GMRT with lower resolution ($20'' \times 15''$) at the lowest frequency. The observed spectra of the prominent thermal subcomponents of W51 have been fitted to a free-free emission spectrum and their physical properties like electron temperatures and emission measures have been estimated. The electron temperatures from continuum spectra are found to be lower than the temperatures reported from radio recombination line (RRL) studies of these HII regions indicating the need for a filling factor even at this resolution. Also, the observed brightness at 240 MHz is found to be higher than expected from the best fits suggesting the need for a multicomponent model for the region.</p>

				<title>Determination of the Mean HI Absorption of the Intergalactic Medium</title>

				<page>0059-0079</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in quasar spectra has been used, together with $N$-body simulations, to determine the underlying matter distribution in the intergalactic medium (IGM). One of the key parameters to be known in order to compare observations and numerical simulations is the mean HI absorption in the IGM. To derive the latter, one has first to fit the quasar continuum.We have observed 20 high redshift and highly luminous QSOs ($m_{V} \leq 17.5$ and $2.40 \leq z_{\text{em}} \leq 3.91$) at intermediate spectral resolution, with either EMMI (ESO Multi-Mode Instrument) on the ESO-NTT telescope or CARELEC at the OHP (Observatoire de Haute-Provence), and applied different methods of determining the QSO continuum to this QSO sample. We have measured the amount of absorption, known as the flux decrement, $DA$, in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest for these different methods and compared the results. In addition, we have compared $DA$ values measured along the same lines of sight observed at high and intermediate spectral resolutions.We discuss the systematics resulting from the use of automatic continuum fitting methods.</p>

The model has been used to solve cosmic ray diffusive transport equation with a complete network of nuclear interactions using the time backward Markov stochastic process by tracing the particles’ trajectories starting from the Solar System back to their sources in the Galaxy.

				<title>Study of High and Low Amplitude Wave Trains of Cosmic Ray Diurnal Variation during Solar Cycle 23</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0089-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed study has been conducted on the long-term changes in the diurnal variation of cosmic rays in terms of high and low amplitude wave trains event (HAEs/LAEs) during the period 1996–2008 (solar cycle 23), using the neutron monitor data from Kiel neutron monitoring station. As such, 17 HAE and 48 LAE cases have been detected and analyzed. These HAEs appear quite dominantly during the declining phase as well as near the maximum of the solar activity cycle 23. In contrast, the low amplitude events (LAEs) are inversely correlated with solar activity cycle. In fact, LAEs appear quite dominantly during the minimum phase of the solar activity. When we compare our results for diurnal phase with that observed on an annual average basis, we notice no significant diurnal phase shift for HAEs as well as for LAEs. Moreover, we find that the high-speed solar wind streams (HSSWS) do not play any significant role in causing these variations. These results are discussed on the basis of that observed in earlier cycles.</p>

				<title>Extracting Information from the Gravitational Redshift of Compact Rotating Objects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0105-0119</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Essential macroscopic internal properties of compact objects can be related to each other with the help of General Relativity. A somewhat familiar example is the relationship between the compactness $M/R$ and the gravitational redshift for nonrotating bodies. Rotation poses new challenges when trying to relate observed or potentially observed quantities such as the graviational redshift, mass, radius, and angular velocity. Using a perturbative approach, we present an analytical approximation whose purpose is to relate these quantities. Two main results are highlighted: Derivation of a new maximal angular velocity depending only on the mass of the object and a possible estimate of the radius from a measurement of the gravitational redshift.</p>

				<title>Oxygen Abundance Methods in SDSS: View from Modern Statistics</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0121-0133</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Our purpose is to find which is the most reliable one among various oxygen abundance determination methods. We will test the validity of several different oxygen abundance determination methods using methods of modern statistics. These methods include Bayesian analysis and information scoring. We will analyze a sample of $\sim 6000$ HII galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic observations data release four. All methods that we used drew the same conclusion that the $T_{e}$ method is a more reliable oxygen abundance determination method than the Bayesian metallicity method under the existing telescope ability. The ratios of the likelihoods between the different kinds of methods tell us that the $T_{e}$, $P$, and $O3N2$ methods are consistent with each other because the $P$ and $O3N2$ methods are calibrated by $T_{e}$ method. The Bayesian and $R_{23}$ methods are consistent with each other because both are calibrated by a galaxy model. In either case, the $N2$ method is an <i>unreliable</i> method.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In understanding the nucleosynthesis of the elements in stars, one of the most important quantities is the reaction rate and it must be evaluated in terms of the stellar temperature $T$, and its determination involves the knowledge of the excitation function $\sigma(E)$ of the specific nuclear reaction leading to the final nucleus.

				<page>0147-0153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate on the relative inclination of the planets B and C orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. First, we show that the third Kepler’s law does represent an adequate model for the orbital periods $P$ of the planets, because other Newtonian and Einsteinian corrections are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy in measuring $P_{B/C}$. Then, on the basis of available timing data, we determine the ratio sin $i_{C}/ \sin i_{B} = 0.92\pm 0.05$ of the orbital inclinations $i_{B}$ and $i_{C}$ independently of the pulsar’s mass $M$. It turns out that coplanarity of the orbits of B and C would imply a violation of the equivalence principle. Adopting a pulsar mass range $1 \lesssim M \lesssim 3$, in solar masses (supported by present-day theoretical and observational bounds for pulsar’s masses), both face-on and edge-on orbital configurations for the orbits of the two planets are ruled out; the acceptable inclinations for B span the range 36 deg $\lesssim i_{B} \lesssim 66$ deg, with a corresponding relative inclination range 6 deg $\lesssim (i_{C} − i_{B}) \lesssim 13$ deg.</p>

				<title>Evidence of Decay of Flux Ratio of Fe to Fe–Ni Line Features with Electron Temperature in Solar Flares</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0155-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report observational evidence of the decay of the flux ratio of Fe to Fe–Ni line features as a function of plasma electron temperature in solar flares in comparison to that theoretically predicted by Phillips (2004). We present the study of spectral analysis of 14 flares observed by the Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS) – Low Energy Detector (SLD) payload. The SLD payload employs the state-of-the-art solid state detectors, viz., Si PIN and Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) devices. The sub-keV energy resolution of Si PIN detector allows us to study the Fe-line and Fe–Ni line features appearing at 6.7 and 8 keV, respectively, in greater detail. In order to best-fit the whole spectrum at one time in the desired energy range between 4 and 25 keV we considered Gaussian-line, the multi-thermal power-law and broken power-law functions. We found that the flux ratio of Fe to Fe–Ni line features decays with flare electron temperature by the asymptotic form of polynomial of inverse third order. The relative flux ratio is $\sim 30$ at temperature 12 MK which drops to half, $\sim 15$ at 20 MK, and at further higher temperatures it decreases smoothly reaching to $\sim 8$ at $\sim 50$ MK. The flux ratio, however, at a given flare plasma temperature, and its decrease with temperature is significantly lower than that predicted theoretically. We propose that the difference may be due to the consideration of higher densities of Fe and Fe–Ni lines in the theoretical model of Phillips (2004). We suggest revising the Fe and Fe–Ni line densities in the corona. The decay of flux ratio explains the variation of equivalent width and peak energy of these line features with temperature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>With the use of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) compiled by Richardson and Cane from 1996 to 2007 and the associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we investigate the solar cycle variation of real ICME-associated CME latitudes during solar cycle 23 using Song <i>et al.</i>’s method.

					<ul>
						<li>Although most of ICME-associatedCMEsare distributed at lowlatitudes, there is a significant fraction of ICME-associated CMEs occurring at high latitudes.</li>
						<li>The latitudinal evolution of ICME-associated CMEs do not follow Spörer’s sunspot law at low latitudes (thus, no ‘butterfly diagram’); however, at high latitudes, there may be a poleward motion and an equator-ward motion from the rise to the maximum to the declining phases.</li>

				<title>Could the Optical Transient SCP 06F6 be due to Microlensing?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0213-0219</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we consider the mysterious optical transient SCP 06F6 displaying a symmetric light curve with a (half-time) duration of about 100 days. The projected location of the event falls close to the center of the galaxy cluster CL 1432.5 + 332.8 lying at the redshift $z = 1.112$. Guided by suggestive symmetry of the light curve and its similarity in two photometric bands, which is a typical signature of microlensing events, we discuss this possibility in several scenarios. As a consistency check we use the lens mass inferred from the event duration and the size of the source. The second check comes from a plausible assumption that since the event was highly magnified there was a perfect alignment at the maximum magnification.</p>
					<p>A scenario where the lens and the source are located in our Galaxy is ruled out. There remain extragalactic scenarios in which the source is a broad absorption line quasar at redshift 2.7 (as might be suggested by transient’s spectroscopy) and the lens could be a compact object associated either with the cluster or with quasar’s host galaxy. They give reasonable results.</p>
					<p>Even if the true nature of the transient eventually turns out different, the idea presented here is interesting from the perspective of cosmological microlensing studies.</p>

				<title>Radio Band Observations of Blazar Variability</title>
				<feature>Part 1. Blazar Observations in Radio</feature>
				<page>0005-0011</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The properties of blazar variability in the radio band are studied using the unique combination of temporal resolution from single dish monitoring and spatial resolution from VLBA imaging. Such measurements now available in all four Stokes parameters, together with theoretical simulations, identify the origin of radio band variability and probe the characteristics of the radio jet where the broadband blazar emission originates. Outbursts in total flux density and linear polarization in the optical-to-radio bands are attributed to shocks propagating within the jet spine, in part, based on limited modelling invoking transverse shocks; new radiative transfer simulations allowing for shocks at arbitrary angle to the flow direction confirm this picture by reproducing the observed centimeter-band variations observed more generally, and are of current interest since these shocks may play a role in the $\gamma$-ray flaring detected by Fermi. Recent UMRAO multifrequency Stokes V studies of bright blazars identify the spectral variability properties of circular polarization for the first time and demonstrate that polarity flips are relatively common. All-Stokes data are consistent with the production of circular polarization by linear-to-circular mode conversion in a region that is at least partially selfabsorbed. Detailed analysis of single-epoch, multifrequency, all-Stokes VLBA observations of 3C 279 support this physical picture and are best explained by emission from an electron-proton plasma.</p>

				<title>Models for High-Energy Radiation from Blazars</title>
				<feature>Part 1. Blazar Observations in Radio</feature>
				<page>0019-0024</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss on the modelling of blazar jets as emitters of multiwavelength radiation with the implementation of a lepto-hadronic treatment. Assuming that injection of non-thermal electrons and protons can take place at the base of the jet, the stationary particle distributions can be found using an inhomogeneous one-dimensional transport equation with cooling and convection. The goal of this approach is to replace the widely used one-zone purely leptonic approximation by a more realistic model. We argue that the rapid variability observed in emission from blazars can be obtained as a result of interaction of the jet with obstacles, i.e., molecular clouds and stars. Long term variability is likely related to changes in the injection and physical conditions in the acceleration region.</p>

				<title>Peculiar Physical Properties of HST-1 in M87</title>
				<feature>Part 1. Blazar Observations in Radio</feature>
				<page>0025-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report on VLA observations of HST-1 in M87 at 8 GHz from 2003–2007, during which a long major outburst occurs from radio to X-ray wave bands. At the VLA resolution, the flux density of HST-1 rises rapidly from 2003, peaks at the end of 2004, and then falls slowly in subsequent stages, which is similar to that in optical and X-ray wave bands. It appears that HST-1 moves with an apparent speed of $1.23c\pm 0.91c$, and the fractional polarization keeps rising through the whole major outburst. The persistent increase in polarization level may mainly be attributed to the formation of a couple of new ‘subcomponents’ of relatively high degree of polarization within HST-1, and the weakening depolarization due to Faraday rotation and/or opacity through the whole major outburst.</p>

				<title>Radio Variability of First 3-Month Fermi Blazars at 5 GHz: Affected by Interstellar Scintillation?</title>
				<feature>Part 1. Blazar Observations in Radio</feature>
				<page>0029-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Blazars from the first-three-months Fermi-AGN list were observed with the Urumqi 25-m radio telescope at 5 GHz in IDV (Intra-Day Variability) mode and inter-month observation mode. A significant correlation between the flux density at 5 GHz and the $\gamma$-ray intensity for the Fermi-LAT detected blazars is seen. There is a higher IDV detection rate in Fermi detected blazars than those reported for other samples. Stronger variability appears at lower galactic latitudes; IDV appears to be stronger in weaker sources, indicating that the variability is affected by interstellar scintillation.</p>

				<title>Multi-Wavelength Studies on H$_{2}$O Maser Host Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0041</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>H$_{2}$O maser emissions have been found in external galaxies for more than 30 years. Main sciences associated with extragalactic H$_{2}$O masers can be summarized roughly into three parts: maser emission itself, AGN sciences and cosmology exploration. Our work in this field focusses on two projects: X-ray data analysis of individual maser source using X-ray penetrability to explore maser host obscured AGN; multi-wavelength statistical properties of the whole published H$_{2}$O maser sample. Here their nuclear radio properties were investigated in detail, based on their 6-cm and 20-cm radio observation data. Comparing the radio properties between maser-detected sources and non-detected sources at similar distance scale, we find that: (1) maser host galaxies tend to have higher nuclear radio luminosity; (2) the spectral index of both samples is comparable $(\sim 0.6)$, within the error ranges. In addition, for AGN-maser sources, the isotropic maser luminosity tends to increase with rising radio luminosity. Thus we propose the nuclear radio luminosity as one good indicator for searching AGN-masers in the future.</p>

				<title>Long-term Periodicity Analysis of Polarization Variation for Radio Sources</title>
				<feature>Part 1. Blazar Observations in Radio</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>We use the database of University of Michigan Radio Astronomy Observatory (UMRAO) at three radio bands (4.8, 8 and 14.5 GHz) to analyse the long-term polarization variation in search of the possible periodicity. Using the power spectral analysis method (PSA), the Jurkevich method and the discrete correlation function (DCF) method, we find that there are 16 sources lying in periodicity. The results show the astrophysically meaningful periodicity covering 2.1 years to 16.2 years at 4.8 GHz, 2.8 years to 16.3 years at 8 GHz, and 1.8 years to 16.6 years at 14.5 GHz.</p>

					<p>We carry out flux observation at 5 GHz for 124 sources from the ‘clean’ sample of Fermi catalog 1LAC (The First LAT AGN Catalog) with Urumqi 25 m telescope.

					<p>The Eddington ratio $\gamma$ was derived for the entire maser host AGN sample, based on the intrinsic X-ray luminosity, the X-ray bolometric correction $C_{X}$ and the mass of central black hole. Further the [O III] bolometric correction $C_{\text{[O III]}}$ was estimated for our sample. Possible relations were also investigated between the maser luminosity and the bolometric luminosity – the Eddington ratio.</p>

				<title>A Visual Method of Time Scale Determination using a PC for Radio Sources</title>
				<feature>Part 1. Blazar Observations in Radio</feature>
				<page>0053-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Variability is one of the extremely observational properties. In the radio bands, variability is caused by the shock in the jet. In this case, emissions increase rapidly following an exponential curve, and then decrease rapidly also in an exponential curve. The variability time scale is important with regard to the physics carrying on in the jet. However, it is not easy to fit the light curve. In this paper, we proposed a method of light curve fitting on a PC machine, in which the theoretical exponential light curve is adopted to the observations using the least regression method. Using this method, anybody can fit the light curve and get the time scale by moving and clicking themouse.We also used this method to some light curves obtained from the archive and compared our results with those in the literature.</p>

				<title>The Relationship between Radio Luminosity and Core-Dominance Parameter for XBLs</title>
				<feature>Part 1. Blazar Observations in Radio</feature>
				<page>0059-0060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, we investigate the correlation between the luminosity and the core-dominance parameter for a sample of X-ray selected BL Lacertae objects (XBLs), and found that the extended luminosity is strongly anti-correlated with the core-dominance parameter while the core (or the total) luminosity is not correlated with the core-dominance parameter. If this is the case, then we can expect that the lower extended luminosity XBLs and their core luminosity is relatively higher. This can be explained by a relativistic beaming model since in this case, the viewing angle is smaller and the emissions dominate the extended emissions. Therefore, the anti-correlation is in fact the result of the relativistic beaming model.</p>

					<p>Variability is one of the characteristics of blazars. The rapid variability is superposed on the long term variation. In this work, the variability on different time scales, such as intra-day (IDV), short-term (STV) and long-term (LTV) variations are presented for some sources. We also presented our own observations of some selected objects, for which the historical data were compiled for periodicity analysis using several methods. The parameters of the binary black hole system OJ 287 are determined.</p>

					<p>In this work, four methods are introduced to analyse the unevenly sampled data. The four methods are power spectral density, autocorrelation function, structure function and Jurkevich method. Some interesting mathematical links are derived amongst the four methods. These links show that the four methods have the same performance. For the Jurkevich method, the effect of the width of bins is apparent. If the width is half the time scale, the method has better performance.</p>

				<title>Spectral Variability of FSRQs</title>
				<feature>Part 2. Blazar Observations in Infrared and Optical</feature>
				<page>0087-0090</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The optical variability of 29 flat spectrum radio quasars in SDSS Stripe 82 region are investigated by using DR7 released multi-epoch data. All FSRQs show variations with overall amplitude ranging from 0.24 mag to 3.46 mag in different sources. About half of FSRQs show a bluer-when-brighter trend, which is commonly observed for blazars. However, only one source shows a redder-when-brighter trend, which implies it is rare in FSRQs. In this source, the thermal emission may be responsible for the spectral behaviour.</p>

					<p>There are about 3 million astronomical photographic plates around the globe, representing an important data source for various aspects of astrophysics. The main advantage is the large time coverage of 100 years or even more. Recent digitization efforts, together with the development of dedicated software, enables for the first time, effective data mining and data analyses by powerful computers with these archives. Examples of blazars proposed and/or investigated on the astronomical plates are presented and discussed.</p>

				<page>0097-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The BL Lac object S5 0716+714 was monitored in the optical band during October 2008, December 2008 and February 2009. We achieved a best temporal resolution of about 5 min in the $BVRI$ bands. The source was active during the whole monitoring campaign. It showed microvariability in 13 days out of 14 days of observation. Four fast flares were observed with amplitudes ranging from 0.3–0.75 mag. The overall amplitude changes during the whole campaign are $\Delta B \sim 0.^{m} 89$, $\Delta V \sim 0.^{m} 80$, $\Delta R \sim 0.^{m} 73$, and $\Delta I \sim 0.^{m} 51$. On internight time scales, strong bluer-when-brighter chromatism was found while different spectral behaviours were found on intranight time scales.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results of multi-years optical and radio monitoring of radio-loud quasars 0716+714 and 1633+382, aimed at searching the flux variations and possible correlation at different wave bands. Our radio observations were performed with a 22-m radio telescope of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, 14-m radio telescope of the Metsahovi Radio Observatory and 26-m telescope of the Michigan Radio Astronomy Observatory at 4.8, 8.0, 14.5, 22.2 and 36.8 GHz. The optical observations were performed with a Zeiss-1000 reflector of the Special Astrophysical Observatory in the B, V, R filters.</p>
					<p>The harmonic analysis performed for the light curves of 0716+714 from 2002–2010 in radio and optical wave bands revealed the presence of an apparent periodical component in the flux variations. The period of the radio light curve is nearly 3.6 years, and coincides within the errors with the period of the optical light curve (nearly 3.4 years). The duration of the flares is approximately the same in radio and optical ranges, and it is about 100–150 days.</p>

				<title>Multi-Band Spectral Properties of Fermi Blazars</title>
				<feature>Part 2. Blazar Observations in Infrared and Optical</feature>
				<page>0113-0115</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The multi-band data covering optical, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray energy regions of 130 Fermi blazars in the First LAT AGN Catalog (1LAC) were collected to investigate the broadband spectral properties. The composite spectral indices show that HBLs have convex optical-to-X-ray continua and concave X-ray-to-$\gamma$-ray continua, $\alpha_{\gamma X\gamma}\gt 0$ and $\alpha_{XOX}\lt 0$, while FSRQs and LBLs have $\alpha_{\gamma X\gamma}\lt 0$. The $\alpha_{XOX}$ distribution of FSRQs and LBLs extends from negative to positive values. We suggest $\alpha_{\gamma X\gamma}\gt 0$ and $\alpha_{XOX}\lt 0$ could be considered as a criterion for HBLs. Moreover, HBLs have narrow distribution of peak interval of log $v^{\text{ic}}_{\text{p}}=\log v^{\text{syn}}_{\text{p}}$, and FSRQs have significant anti-correlation between log $v^{\text{ic}}_{\text{p}}-\log v^{\text{syn}}_{\text{p}}$ and $\log v^{\text{syn}}_{\text{p}}$. This indicates that SSC model is responsible for high energy emission of HBLs, while EC for FSRQs. Our results also indicate that FSRQs with larger break energy of electrons have smaller bulk Lorentz factor of dissipation region.</p>

				<title>Re-Analysis of QPO in 3C 273 Light Curve</title>
				<feature>Part 2. Blazar Observations in Infrared and Optical</feature>
				<page>0117-0120</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have developed analysis tools to search for quasi periodic oscillations in light curves from active galactic nuclei, using the following time series techniques: Wavelets, periodogram, Lomb–Scargle periodogram, structure function and multi-harmonic analysis of variance.</p>
					<p>The analysis tools incorporate different noise models with significant levels for all the techniques that is an improvement over the previous work. By looking for consistently high significance, we make the detection of periodicities more robust. We apply this tool to a previously reported QPO (Espaillat <i>et al.</i> 2008) in the X-ray light curve of 3C 273 with a periodicity of $\sim 3300$ s and find that the significance is only 74\%\ in the wavelet and fails to show up above 95\%\ significance in the periodogram and multi-harmonic analysis of variance.</p>

				<title>Gamma-Ray and Multiwavelength Emission from Blazars</title>
				<feature>Part 3. Blazar Observations in High Energy Bands</feature>
				<page>0139-0145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Blazars are now well understood as approaching relativistic jets aligned with the line of sight. The long-time uncertainty about the demographics of blazars is starting to become clearer: since the Fermi blazar sample includes a larger fraction of high-frequency peaked blazars (like the typical X-ray-selected blazars in, say, the Einstein Slew Survey sample) than did the higher-flux-limit EGRET blazar sample, these low-luminosity sources must be more common than their higher luminosity, low-frequency-peaked cousins. Blazar spectral energy distributions have a characteristic two-component form, with synchrotron radiation at radio through optical (UV, X-ray) frequencies and gamma-rays from X-ray through GeV (TeV) energies.Multiwavelength monitoring has suggested that gamma-ray flares can result from acceleration of electrons at shocks in the jet, and there appears to be an association between the creation of outflowing superluminal radio components in VLBI maps and the gamma-ray flares. In many cases, the gamma-ray emission is produced by inverse Compton upscattering of ambient optical-UV photons, although the contribution from energetic hadrons cannot be ruled out. The next few years of coordinated gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical, infrared and radio monitoring of blazars will be important for characterizing jet content, structure, and total power.</p>

					<p>Any quasi-periodic variations discovered in blazar light curves would contain important information on the location and nature of the processes within the emission regions. In non-blazar active galactic nuclei, particularly Seyfert galaxies, any such fluctuations are very likely to be associated with the accretion disks, but in blazars they would almost certainly have to emanate from jets. This brief review summarizes recent claims for the presence of quasi-periodic variability in the X-ray emission of several AGN, focusing on blazars. Although no individual claim of the presence of a QPO in AGN X-ray light curves is absolutely convincing, there are some good cases for the presence of QPOs, including the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy, RE J1034+396, the quasar, 3C 273 and the BL Lac, PKS 2155−304.</p>

				<page>0155-0161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well established that the blazars show flux variations in the complete electromagnetic (EM) spectrum on all possible time scales ranging from a few tens of minutes to several years. Here we report the review of various UV and X-ray flux variability properties of blazars. Our analysis show that UV variability amplitude is smaller than X-rays, mostly soft X-rays hardness ratio show correlations with blazar luminosity and different modes of variability might be operating for different time scales and epochs. Quasi periodic oscillations are seen on a few occasions in blazars, higher fraction of high energy peaked blazars show intra day and short term variabilities in X-rays but variability duty cycle is much less in optical bands on intra day time scale compared to low energy peaked blazars. But these results are yet to be established.</p>

				<feature>Part 3. Blazar Observations in High Energy Bands</feature>
				<page>0169-0172</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Fermi LAT provides a continuous and uniform monitoring of the Universe in the gamma-ray band. During the first year many gamma-ray blazar flares, some unidentified transients and emission by the Sun while in a quiet state were promptly detected. This is mainly due to the design of the mission, featuring a detector, the LAT with a wide field of view, and to the operation of the spacecraft itself, that can cover every region of the sky every 3 hours. Nevertheless, the scientific exploitation of this monitoring is more fruitful when early information about transients reaches a broader community. In this respect, the indefatigable activity of flare advocates, who worked on weekly shifts to validate the results and quickly broadcast information about flares and new detections, was the key to most scientific results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present ten years optical/UV/X-ray observations of 3C 273 performed using XMM–Newton between 2000 and 2009. The short-time scale variability behaviour of the soft and hard X-ray light curves may suggest different origins of the soft/hard X-ray emissions. We fit well the 0.2–10 keV X-ray spectrum with a hard power-law component plus a soft Comptonization component. The lack of $\Gamma$–$F$ correlation of the hard power-law component and the weakness of iron $K_{\alpha}$ lines may support dominance of the jet component. The soft X-ray excess correlates much better with ultraviolet than with the hard power-law component, strongly suggesting that soft excess emission originates from inverse Comptonization of UV photons.</p>

					<p>We use Monte Carlo/Fokker–Planck simulations to study the X-ray time lags. Our results show that soft lags will be observed as long as the decay of the flare is dominated by radiative cooling, even when acceleration and cooling time scales are similar. Hard lags can be produced in the presence of a competitive achromatic particle energy loss mechanism if the acceleration process operates on a time scale such that particles are slowly moved towards higher energy while the flare evolves. In this type of scenario, the $\gamma$-ray/X-ray quadratic relation is also reproduced.</p>

				<title>Modelling the IDV Emissions of the BL Lac Objects with a Langevin Type Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
				<feature>Part 4. Emission Models and Theory</feature>
				<page>0189-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we introduce a simplified model for explaining the observations of optical intra-day variability (IDV) of the BL Lac Objects. We assume that the source of the IDV are the stochastic oscillations of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The stochastic fluctuations on the vertical direction of the accretion disk are described by using a Langevin type equation with a damping term and a random, white noise type force. Furthermore, preliminary numerical simulation results are presented, which are based on the numerical analysis of the Langevin stochastic differential equation.</p>

				<title>X-ray Radiation Mechanisms and the Beaming Effect of Hot Spots and Knots in AGN Jets</title>
				<feature>Part 4. Emission Models and Theory</feature>
				<page>0193-0196</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The observed broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 22 hot spots and 45 knots are modelled with single-zone lepton models. Considering the sources at rest, the X-rays of some hot spots can be explained by the SSC model with magnetic field being consistent with the equipartition magnetic field in magnitude of order 1, but at the same time an unreasonably low magnetic field is required to model the X-rays for all knots. When considering the relativistic bulk motion of the sources, the IC/CMB model well explains the X-ray emission for most of them under the equipartition condition. We show that the ratio of observational luminosity $R_{L}$ is tentatively correlated with the co-moving equipartition magnetic field $B_{\text{eq}}$ and the beaming factor $\delta$. These facts suggest that the observational differences of the X-rays from the knots and hot spots may be mainly due to the differences in the Doppler boosting effect and the co-moving magnetic field of the two kinds of source.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The orientations of the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the stellar disk of its host galaxy are both determined by the angular momentum of their forming gas, but on very different physical environments and spatial scales. Here we show the evidence that the orientation of the stellar disk is correlated with the accretion disk by comparing the inclinations of the stellar disks of a large sample of Type 2 AGNs selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York <i>et al.</i> 2000) to a control galaxy sample. Given that the Type 2 AGN fraction is in the range of 70–90 percent for low luminosity AGNs as <i>a priori</i>, we find that the mean tilt between the accretion disk and stellar disk is $\sim 30$ degrees (Shen <i>et al.</i> 2010).</p>

				<title>Estimating Black Hole Masses of Blazars</title>
				<feature>Part 5. Black Holes in Blazars</feature>
				<page>0209-0215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estimating black hole masses of blazars is still a big challenge. Because of the contamination of jets, using the previously suggested size–continuum luminosity relation can overestimate the broad line region (BLR) size and black hole mass for radio-loud AGNs, including blazars. We propose a new relation between the BLR size and $H_{\beta}$ emission line luminosity and present evidences for using it to get more accurate black hole masses of radio-loud AGNs. For extremely radio-loud AGNs such as blazars with weak/absent emission lines, we suggest the use of fundamental plane relation of their elliptical host galaxies to estimate the central velocity dispersions and black hole masses, if their velocity dispersions are not known but the host galaxies can be mapped. The black hole masses of some well-known blazars, such as OJ 287, AO 0235+164 and 3C 66B are obtained using these two methods and the $M$–$\sigma$ relation. The implications of their black hole masses on other related studies are also discussed.</p>

				<feature>Part 5. Black Holes in Blazars</feature>
				<page>0217-0222</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The emission from blazars is known to be variable at all wavelengths. The flux variability is often accompanied by spectral changes. Spectral energy distribution (SED) changes must be associated with changes in the spectra of emitting electrons and/or the physical parameters of the jet. Meaningful modeling of blazar broadband spectra is required to understand the extreme conditions within the emission region. Not only is the broadband SED crucial, but also information about its variability is needed to understand how the highest states of emission occur and how they differ from the low states. This may help in discriminating between models. Here we present the results of our SED modeling of the blazar S5 0716+714 during various phases of its activity. The SEDs are classified into different bins depending on the optical brightness state of the source.</p>

				<title>Unification of Radio Galaxies and their Accretion Jet Properties</title>
				<feature>Part 5. Black Holes in Blazars</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the relation between black hole mass, $M_{\text{bh}}$, and jet power, $Q_{\text{jet}}$, for a sample of BL Lacs and radio quasars. We find that BL Lacs are separated from radio quasars by the FR I/II dividing line in $M_{\text{bh}}-Q_{\text{jet}}$ plane, which strongly supports the unification scheme of FR I/BL Lac and FR II/radio quasar. The Eddington ratio distribution of BL Lacs and radio quasars exhibits a bimodal nature with a rough division at $L_{\text{bol}}/L_{\text{Edd}} \sim 0.01$, which imply that they may have different accretion modes. We calculate the jet power extracted from advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), and find that it requires dimensionless angular momentum of black hole $j\simeq 0.9 - 0.99$ to reproduce the dividing line between FR I/II or BL Lac/radio quasar if dimensionless accretion rate $\dot{m} = 0.01$ is adopted, which is required by the above bimodal distribution of Eddington ratios. Our results suggest that black holes in radio galaxies are rapidly spinning.</p>

				<title>Multi-Waveband Emission Maps of Blazars</title>
				<feature>Part 6. Combined Multi-Waveband Observations</feature>
				<page>0233-0237</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We are leading a comprehensive multi-waveband monitoring program of 34 $\gamma$-ray bright blazars designed to locate the emission regions of blazars from radio to $\gamma$-ray frequencies. The ‘maps’ are anchored by sequences of images in both total and polarized intensity obtained with the VLBA at an angular resolution of $\sim 0.1$ milliarcseconds. The time-variable linear polarization at radio to optical wavelengths and radio to $\gamma$-ray light curves allow us to specify the locations of flares relative to bright stationary features seen in the images and to infer the geometry of the magnetic field in different regions of the jet. Our data reveal that some flares occur simultaneously at different wavebands and others are only seen at some of the frequencies. The flares are often triggered by a superluminal knot passing through the stationary ‘core’ on the VLBA images. Other flares occur upstream or even parsecs downstream of the core.</p>

				<title>Multi-Frequency Observations of Gamma-Ray Blazar 1633+382</title>
				<feature>Part 6. Combined Multi-Waveband Observations</feature>
				<page>0239-0242</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We perform monthly monitoring of the quasar 1633+382 (4C+38.41) within a sample of $\gamma$-ray blazars with the VLBA at 43 GHz along with optical photometric and polarimetric observations. We construct the $\gamma$-ray light curve of 1633+382 using data obtained by the Fermi LAT. We find that a high $\gamma$-ray state of the quasar starting in 2009 September is simultaneous with an increase of the flux in the mm-wave VLBI core. We resolve a superluminal feature on the VLBA images that appears to be responsible for the mm-wave flux increase. We find a strong correlation between optical and $\gamma$-ray light curves with a delay of $\gamma$-ray variations of $5\pm 3$ days, as well as a strong correlation between optical flux and degree of polarization during the high $\gamma$-ray state. Comparison between the optical polarization position angle and that in the VLBI core supports the idea that in the quasar 1633+382 a high $\gamma$-ray state is connected with processes originating near the mm-VLBI core.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, we explore a sample of 362 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) to investigate the jet formation. We find that the fundamental plane for our FSRQs can be expressed as $L_{\text{5\;GHz}}\propto M^{-0.19}_{\text{bh}}L^{1.08}_{\text{2\; keV}}$. We also find that the 5 GHz luminosities are tightly related to both black hole mass and Eddington ratio, which is established as $L_{\text{5\;GHz}}\propto M^{0.67}_{\text{bh}}(L_{\text{bol}}/L_{\text{EDD}})^{1.32}$.</p>

					<p>Apparent superluminal motion of different radio-loud AGNs are similarly related with beaming effect. The cosmological expanding effect would play no part in the superluminal motion of radio galaxies, BL Lacertae objects as well as quasars.Meanwhile, we confirm that estimates for apparent velocity $\beta_{\text{app}}$ and Doppler boosting factor $\delta$ based on multi-wavelength combination and variability are comparable.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We analyze the spectral variability for two narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies, PG 1700+518 and NGC 4051 using the spectral decomposition method. We focus on their optical Fe II variability to investigate the origin of Fe II in AGNs. For PG 1700+518, we find that the Fe II size is about 200 light-days, which is consistent with the H$\beta$ size derived from the empirical R–L relation. For NGC 4051, the [O III] 5007 Å flux is strongly correlated with continuum flux, suggesting that we should recalibrate the spectral flux on a scale defined by [O III] flux. The corrected light curves of Fe II, H$\beta$, He II, $f_{\gamma}$(5100 Å) are given here. A detailed analysis will be given in the near future.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>VX Sgr, a semi-regular variable, is a red giant star with intense SiO maser emission at 43 GHz. The pumping mechanism of the circumstellar SiO masers has been controversial for decades since its discovery. In order to pursue this long-standing problem further, we have carried out simultaneous VLBA observations of two 7 mm SiO masers at five epochs in about two years. We present relatively aligned $v = 1$ and $v = 2$, $J = 1-0$ SiO maser maps and discuss the dominant pumping mechanism, which may be epoch dependent or a combination of both mechanisms.</p>

					<p>We study the complexity of supergranular cells using the intensity patterns obtained from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory during the 23rd solar cycle. Our data consists of visually identified supergranular cells, from which a fractal dimension D for supergranulation is obtained according to the relation $P\propto A^{D/2}$, where $A$ is the area and $P$ is the perimeter of the supergranular cells. We find a difference in the fractal dimension between active and quiet region cells in the ascending phase, during the peak and in the descending phase which is conjectured to be due to the magnetic activity level.</p>

					<p>In this work, we employ a sample of 185 steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs) to estimate their black hole masses from broad emission lines. Our black hole masses are compared with the virial black hole masses estimated by Shen (2010). We find that there is a large deviation between the two kinds of values if the black hole masses are estimated from broad emission line of CIV. However, both values are in agreement if the black hole masses are estimated from broad emission line of MgII or H$\beta$.</p>

					<p>We carry out flux monitoring on a sample of 169 Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 5 GHz and find that about one-third of them show considerable Inter-Month Variability (IMV), and these IMV phenomena are likely to be caused by interstellar scintillation (ISS). Furthermore, we find that those showing IMV tend to be point-like or core-jet structures at VLBI scale.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the vertical structure of neutrino-dominated accretion flows in spherical coordinates. In our calculation, the empty funnel along the rotation axis can naturally explain the neutrino annihilable ejection. The outflow is possible due to the positive Bernoulli function, and the luminosity of neutrino annihilation is enhanced by one or two orders of magnitude.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present a spatially 1.5-dimensional, time-dependent numerical study of accretion disks around Kerr black holes. Our study focuses on the limit-cycle behavior of thermally unstable accretion disks. We find that maximal luminosity may be a more appropriate probe of black hole spin than the cycle duration and influence radius.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The standard thin disk model predicts that when the accretion rate is moderately high, the disk is radiation–pressure-dominated and thermally unstable. However, observations indicate the opposite, namely the disk is quite stable. We present an explanation in this work by taking into account the role of the magnetic field which was ignored in the previous analysis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>GRB 100418A is a long burst at $z = 0.624$ without detection of associated supernova (SN).We present a detailed analysis on this event and discuss possible origins of its multi-wavelength emission. The temporal features of this event is similar to GRB 060614, a well-known nearby long GRB without SN association (possibly a Type I GRB), indicating that the two events may be cosmic twins. However, both the circumburst medium density and the GRB classification based on the gamma-ray energy and spectrum suggest that GRB 100418A would be a Type II GRB. These results make a great puzzle on the progenitors of this kind of events, if they belong to the same population.</p>

We compare our black hole masses with the virial black hole masses measured by Shen <i>et al.</i> (2010).We find that there is a large deviation between them if our black hole mass is measured from the CIV broad emission line. Whereas, if our black hole mass is measured from broad emission line of Mg II or Hβ, both the values are consistent.</p>

					<p>We study multi-wavelength variability in BL Lacertae object PKS 2155-304 in the frame of the time dependent one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, where stochastic particle acceleration is taken into account. In this model, a homogeneously and isotropically spherical structure is assumed, the Fokker–Planck type equation which describes the evolution of the particles energy is numerically solved, and the synchrotron and self-Compton components from the spherical blob are calculated. Our results can reproduce observed spectra energy distribution (SED) and give definite predictions for the flux and spectral variability of PKS 2155-304.We find that particle injection rate, magnetic field and Doppler factor in the acceleration zone are important parameters for explaining its flaring behaviour.</p>

					<p>Astronomy is a very interesting subject for undergraduate students studying physics. In this paper, we report astronomy education for undergraduate students in the Physics Department of Guangzhou University, and how we are teaching astronomy to the students. Astrophysics has been rapidly developing since 1994, when the center for astrophysics was founded. Now, astrophysics has become a key subject in Guangdong Province, and the Astronomy Science and Technology Research Laboratory one of the key laboratories of the Department of Education of the Guangdong Province. Many undergraduate students, working under the tutorship of faculty members completed their thesis at the Center for Astrophysics in Guangzhou.</p>

				<page>0341-0349</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Presentations at the Guangzhou Conference on Multiwave-length  Emission from Blazars confirmed our understanding of blazars as relativistic jets closely aligned with the line of sight. Powerful new studies have been enabled by the Fermi gamma-ray satellite and new ground-based  TeV facilities, which are an order of magnitude more sensitive than their predecessors. Combining gamma-ray data with VLBA radio and with optical/IR photometry has shed new light on the emission mechanisms and the jet geometry. This conference summary sets the context for the 4th blazar conference and presents some of the highlights from the meeting, as well as the questions that remain outstanding.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0359-0370</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The origin of extragalactic diffuse gamma ray is not accurately known, especially because our suggestions are related to many models that need to be considered either to compute the galactic diffuse gamma ray intensity or to consider the contribution of other extragalactic structures while surveying a specific portion of the sky. More precise analysis of EGRET data however, makes it possible to estimate the diffuse gamma ray in Coma supercluster (i.e., Coma\A1367 supercluster) direction with a value of $I(E \gt 30\text{\,MeV}) \sim 1.9 \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which is considered to be an upper limit for the diffuse gamma ray due to Coma supercluster. The related total intensity (on average) is calculated to be $\sim 5$\%\ of the actual diffuse extragalactic background. The calculated intensity makes it possible to estimate the origin of extragalactic diffuse gamma ray.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Following an extremely interesting idea (Schieber 1984), published long ago, the work function associated with the emission of ultra-relativistic electrons from magnetically deformed metallic crystal (mainly iron) at the outer crust of a magnetar is obtained using relativistic version of Thomas–Fermi type model for electron distribution around the nuclei in this region. In the present scenario, surprisingly, the work function becomes anisotropic; the longitudinal part is an increasing function of magnetic field strength, whereas the transverse part diverges.</p>

				<page>0391-0399</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The influence of the potential well depth $U^{(N)}_{\Sigma}$ of $\Sigma$ in nuclear matter on the surface gravitational red-shift of a proto neutron star is examined within the framework of the relativistic mean field theory for the baryon octet system. It is found that as $U^{(N)}_{\Sigma}$ increases from $-35$ MeV to +35 MeV, the surface gravitational red-shift increases and the influence of the negative $U^{(N)}_{\Sigma}$ on the surface gravitational red-shift is larger than that of the positive ones. Furthermore, the $M_{\text{max}}/R$ and the surface gravitational red-shift corresponding to the maximum mass all increase as the $U^{(N)}_{\Sigma}$ increases, $M_{\text{max}}$ and $R$ being the maximum mass of the proto neutron star and the corresponding radius respectively.</p>

				<title>The Relative Phase Asynchronization between Sunspot Numbers and Polar Faculae</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0401-0409</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The monthly sunspot numbers compiled by Temmer <i>et al.</i> and the monthly polar faculae from observations of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, for the interval of March 1954 to March 1996, are used to investigate the phase relationship between polar faculae and sunspot activity for total solar disk and for both hemispheres in solar cycles 19, 20, 21 and 22. We found that (1) the polar faculae begin earlier than sunspot activity, and the phase difference exhibits a consistent behaviour for different hemispheres in each of the solar cycles, implying that this phenomenon should not be regarded as a stochastic fluctuation; (2) the inverse correlation between polar faculae and sunspot numbers is not only a long-term behaviour, but also exists in short time range; (3) the polar faculae show leads of about 50–71 months relative to sunspot numbers, and the phase difference between them varies with solar cycle; (4) the phase difference value in the northern hemisphere differs from that in the southern hemisphere in a solar cycle, which means that phase difference also existed between the two hemispheres. Moreover, the phase difference between the two hemispheres exhibits a periodical behaviour. Our results seem to support the finding of Hiremath (2010).</p>

				<title>Particle Acceleration at Shocks: Insights from Supernova Remnant Shocks</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0427-0435</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>I review some basic properties of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in the context of young supernova remnants (SNRs). I also point out some key differences with cosmological, cluster-related shocks. DSA seems to be very efficient in strong, young SNR shocks. Provided the magnetic fields exceed some hundreds of $\mu$Gauss (possibly amplified by CR related dynamics), these shocks can accelerate cosmic ray hadrons to PeV energies in the time available to them. Electron energies, limited by radiative losses, are likely limited to the TeV range. Injection of fresh particles at these shocks is poorly understood, but hadrons are much more easily injected than the more highly magnetized electrons. That seems supported by observational data, as well. So, while CR protons in young SNRs may play very major roles in the SNR evolution, the CR electron populations have minimal such impact, despite their observational importance.</p>

				<title>Giant Radio Halos in Galaxy Clusters as Probes of Particle Acceleration in Turbulent Regions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0437-0445</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Giant radio halos in galaxy clusters probe mechanisms of particle acceleration connected with cluster merger events. Shocks and turbulence are driven in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) during clusters mergers and may have a deep impact on the non-thermal properties of galaxy clusters. Models of turbulent (re)acceleration of relativistic particles allow good correspondence with present observations, from radio halos to $\gamma$-ray upper limits, although several aspects of this complex scenario still remain poorly understood.</p>
					<p>After providing basic motivations for turbulent acceleration in galaxy clusters, we discuss relevant aspects of the physics of particle acceleration by MHD turbulence and the expected broad-band non-thermal emission from galaxy clusters. We discuss (in brief) the most important results of turbulent (re)acceleration models, the open problems, and the possibilities to test models with future observations. In this respect, further constraints on the origin of giant nearby radio halos can also be obtained by combining their (spectral and morphological) properties with the constraints from $\gamma$-ray observations of their parent clusters.</p>

				<title>The Central Point Source in G76.9+1.0</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0451-0455</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We describe the serendipitous discovery of a very steep-spectrum radio point source in low-frequency Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) images of the supernova remnant (SNR) G76.9+1.0. The steep spectrum, as well as the location of the point source near the centre of this SNR confirm that this indeed is the pulsar J2022+3842. Archival <i>Chandra</i> X-ray data shows a point source coincident with the radio point source. However, no pulsed radio emission was detected despite deep searches at 610 MHz and 1160 MHz – which can be understood to be due to temporal broadening of the pulses. Weak pulsed emission has indeed been seen at 2 GHz with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), establishing the fact that scattering is responsible for its non-detection at low radio frequencies. We underline the usefulness of low-frequency  radio imaging as a good technique to prospect for pulsar candidates.</p>

					<p>Diffuse polarized emission by synchrotron is a key tool to investigate magnetic fields in the Milky Way, particularly the ordered component of the large scale structure. Key observables are the synchrotron emission itself and the RM is by Faraday rotation. In this paper the main properties of the radio polarized diffuse emission and its use to investigate magnetic fields will be reviewed along with our current understanding of the galactic magnetic field and the data sets available. We will then focus on the future perspective discussing RM-synthesis – the new powerful instrument devised to unlock the information encoded in such an emission – and the surveys currently in progress like S-PASS and GMIMS.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we present the first low frequency ($\lt 1.4$ GHz) radio continuum study of a Wolf Rayet galaxy NGC 4214 using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We detect diffuse extended emission from the galaxy disk at 325 MHz and find that the radio emission closely follows the ultraviolet emission mapped by GALEX. The galaxy is undergoing continuous star formation which can explain the diffuse emission. We suggest that the diffuse radio continuum emission and X-ray emission detected in the northern part of NGC 4214 is associated with a background galaxy, 2MASX J12153795+3622218.</p>

				<title>CGCG292-057: A Near-Distance Merger Galaxy with Double;Double Radio Lobes and X-shape Structure</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0467-0470</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>J1159+5820 is an extended radio galaxy with a quite unusual morphology, featuring two pairs of radio lobes. Such sources, called double–double radio galaxies, constitute a very rare class of extragalactic radio sources. Furthermore, the extended radio structure of this source shows an X-shape form. According to a much likely scenario, such a morphology is due to interrupting nuclear activity in its central active galactic nucleus. Interestingly, the host of this source is a near-distance bright galaxy named CGCG292-057, which is clearly disturbed, with tidal features and shells as plausible signs of a recent merger.</p>

					<p>We present the first set of polarimetric images made with the GMRT. We find that the instrumental polarization leakage at the GMRT varies with frequency.

We present 610 MHz polarization images of two extended FR-II radio galaxies, viz. 3C 79 and 3C 265.

				<abstract>
					<p>Relativistic and magnetized plasma ejected by radio loud AGNs through jets form the diffuse lobes of radio galaxies. The radiating particles (electron/electron–positron) in lobes emit in radio via the synchrotron process and X-ray via inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons. The thermal environment around radio galaxies emits X-rays via the thermal bremsstrahlung process. By combining information from these processes we can measure physical conditions in and around the radio lobes and thus study the dynamics of radio galaxies, including double–double radio galaxies.</p>

					<p>Using X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton and radio observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we have examined the merging environment of the bimodal cluster Abell 3395. From X-ray data we have produced thermodynamic maps of the cluster. The Wide Angle Tail (WAT) galaxy seen in the radio is slightly offset from the X-ray emission peak of the southern part of the cluster. The unsharp masked Chandra image of the cluster does not show any deficit in the X-ray flux near the location of the source possibly because the thermal plasma has leaked into the cavities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>High sensitivity observations of radio halos in galaxy clusters at frequencies $v \leq 330$ MHz are still relatively rare, and very little is known compared to the classical 1.4 GHz images. The few radio halos imaged down to 150–240 MHz show a considerable spread in size, morphology and spectral properties. All clusters belonging to the GMRT Radio Halo Survey with detected or candidate cluster-scale diffuse emission have been imaged at 325 MHz with the GMRT. Few of them were also observed with the GMRT at 240 MHz and 150 MHz. For A1682, imaging is particularly challenging due to the presence of strong and extended radio galaxies at the center. Our data analysis suggests that thew radio galaxies are superposed to very low surface brightness radio emission extended on the cluster scale, which we present here.</p>

				<title>Relics as Probes of Galaxy Cluster Mergers</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0505-0508</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Galaxy clusters grow by mergers with other clusters and galaxy groups. These mergers create shocks within the intracluster medium (ICM). It is proposed that particles can be accelerated to extreme energies within the shocks. In the presence of a magnetic field these particles should then form large regions emitting synchrotron radiation, creating the so-called radio relics. An example of a cluster with relics is CIZA J2242.8+5301. Here we present hydrodynamical simulations of idealized binary cluster collisions with the aim of constraining the merger scenario for this cluster. We conclude that by using the location, size and width of double radio relics we can set constraints on the mass ratios, impact parameters, time scales, and viewing geometries of binary cluster merger events.</p>

				<title>Radio Relics in Cosmological Simulations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0509-0517</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radio relics have been discovered in many galaxy clusters. They are believed to trace shock fronts induced by cluster mergers. Cosmological simulations allow us to study merger shocks in detail since the intra-cluster medium is heated by shock dissipation. Using high resolution cosmological simulations, identifying shock fronts and applying a parametric model for the radio emission allows us to simulate the formation of radio relics. We analyze a simulated shock front in detail. We find a rather broad Mach number distribution. The Mach number affects strongly the number density of relativistic electrons in the downstream area, hence, the radio luminosity varies significantly across the shock surface. The abundance of radio relics can be modeled with the help of the radio power probability distribution which aims at predicting radio relic number counts. Since the actual electron acceleration efficiency is not known, predictions for the number counts need to be normalized by the observed number of radio relics. For the characteristics of upcoming low frequency surveys we find that about thousand relics are awaiting discovery.</p>

				<title>The Connection between Radio Halos and Cluster Mergers and the Statistical Properties of the Radio Halo Population</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0519-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the statistical properties of the radio halo population in galaxy clusters. Radio bi-modality is observed in galaxy clusters: a fraction of clusters host giant radio halos while a majority of clusters do not show evidence of diffuse cluster-scale radio emission. The radio bi-modality has a correspondence in terms of dynamical state of the hosting clusters showing that merging clusters host radio halos and follow the well-known radio-X-ray correlation, while more relaxed clusters do not host radio halos and populate a region well separated from that correlation. These evidences can be understood in the framework of a scenario wheremerger-driven turbulence re-accelerate the radio emitting electrons. We discuss the main statistical expectations of this scenario underlining the important role of the upcoming LOFAR surveys to test present models.</p>

				<title>Discovery of a Giant Radio Halo in a Massive Merging Cluster at $z = 0.443$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0529-0532</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have discovered a giant radio halo in the massive merging cluster MACSJ0417.5-1154. This cluster, at a redshift of 0.443, is one of the most X-ray luminous galaxy cluster in the MAssive Cluster Survey (MACS) with an X-ray luminosity in the 0.1–2.4 keV band of $2.9×10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Recent observations from GMRT at 230 and 610 MHz have revealed a radio halo of $\sim 1.2 \times 0.3$ Mpc$^{2}$ in extent. This halo is elongated along the North-West, similar to the morphology of the X-ray emission from Chandra. The 1400 MHz radio luminosity $(L_{r})$ of the halo is $\sim 2 \times 10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, in good agreement with the value expected from the $L_{x}-L_{r}$ correlation for cluster halos.</p>

				<title>Double Relics in the Outskirts of A3376: Accretion Flows Meet Merger Shocks?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0533-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The case of spectacular ring-like double radio relics in the merging, rich galaxy cluster A3376 is of great interest to study non-thermal phenomena at cluster outskirts.We present the first low frequency (330 and 150 MHz) images of the double relics using the GMRT. With our GMRT 330 MHz map and the VLA 1400 MHz map (Bagchi <i>et al.</i> 2006), we have constructed and analyzed the distribution of spectral indices over the radio relics. We find flat spectral indices at the outer edges of both the relics and a gradual steepening of spectral indices toward the inner regions. This supports the model of outgoing merger shock waves. The eastern relic has a complex morphology and spectral index distribution toward the inner region. This will be discussed in the context of the effect of large-scale accretion flows on the outgoing merger shocks as reported in the recent simulations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Radio relics in galaxy clusters can be electrons accelerated at cluster merger shocks or adiabatically compressed fossil radio cocoons or dying radio galaxies. The spectral evolution of radio relics is affected by the surrounding thermal plasma. We present a low frequency study of three radio relics representing environments of dense cluster core (A4038), cluster outskirts (A1664) and filaments (A786). The properties of the relics are found to be consistent with the effect of confinement by external medium if the effects of projection are ignored.</p>

				<title>Searching for Excess Rotation Measures in Galaxy Clusters with the NVSS</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0539-0540</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a statistical analysis of the rotation measure (RM) catalogue from the NVSS in search for a statistical excess of rotation measure through Abell clusters. After excluding the data known to be affected by the large-scale magnetic field of the Galaxy $(b \leq |30|)$, we consider RMs as a function of normalized Abell radius for 496 galaxy clusters. Despite that it is now well established that galaxy clusters contain magnetic fields, we find no evidence of an increase of the rotation measure for lines of sight toward Abell clusters. Additionally, we find no evidence for statistically different rotation measure values between cluster lines of sight and RMs up to 7 Abell radii from the cluster over that expected from the intrinsic variation of the NVSS dataset. We suggest this is the result of sparse spatial coverage of suitably polarized sources in the NVSS.</p>

				<page>0541-0544</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present 18 GHz observations of the Bullet cluster using the Austalia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), which show structure in the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect; in particular, a deep, compact feature which does not correspond to any bright feature in X-ray, optical or lensing maps. In general, the relatively deeper SZE features appear to avoid the regions with the most intense X-ray emission. SZE displaced from X-ray centres implies that modeling cluster dynamics is non-trivial. The SZE distribution in the western parts of the cluster are co-spatial with the radio halo indicative of a common origin for the hot and relativistic electrons in the turbulent wake of the Bullet.</p>

				<title>Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback and Clusters</title>

				<page>0545-0548</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Intracluster Medium (ICM) is believed to have been affected by feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and/or supernovae-driven winds. These sources are supposed to have injected entropy into the ICM gas. The recently determined universal pressure profile of the ICM gas has been used and after comparing with the entropy profile of the gas from gravitational effects of the dark matter halo, the additional entropy injected by non-gravitational sources, as a function of the total cluster mass is determined. The current observational data of red-shift evolution of cluster scaling relation is shown that allow models in which the entropy injection decreases at high red-shift.</p>

				<title>Manifestations of Magnetic Field Inhomogeneities</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0549-0555</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Both observations and simulations reveal large inhomogeneities in magnetic field distributions in diffuse plasmas. Incorporating these inhomogeneities into various calculations can significantly change the inferred physical conditions. In extragalactic sources, e.g., these can compromise analyses of spectral ageing, which I will illustrate with some current work on cluster relics. I also briefly re-examine the old issue of how inhomogeneous fields affect particle lifetimes; perhaps not surprisingly, the next generation of radio telescopes are unlikely to find many sources that can extend their lifetimes from putting relativistic electrons into a low-field ‘freezer’. Finally, I preview some new EVLA results on the complex relic in Abell 2256, with implications for the interspersing of its relativistic and thermal plasmas.</p>

				<title>LOFAR and APERTIF Surveys of the Radio Sky: Probing Shocks and Magnetic Fields in Galaxy Clusters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0557-0566</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At very low frequencies, the new pan-European radio telescope LOFAR is opening the last unexplored window of the electromagnetic spectrum for astrophysical studies. The revolutionary APERTIF-phased arrays that are about to be installed on the Westerbork radio telescope (WSRT) will dramatically increase the survey speed for the WSRT. Combined surveys with these two facilities will deeply chart the northern sky over almost two decades in radio frequency from $\sim 15$ up to 1400 MHz. Here we briefly describe some of the capabilities of these new facilities and what radio surveys are planned to study fun-damental issues related to the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. In the second part we briefly review some recent observational results directly showing that diffuse radio emission in clusters traces shocks due to cluster mergers. As these diffuse radio sources are relatively bright at low frequencies, LOFAR should be able to detect thousands of such sources up to the epoch of cluster formation. This will allow addressing many question about the origin and evolution of shocks and magnetic fields in clusters. At the end we briefly review some of the first and very preliminary LOFAR results on clusters.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polarized radio emission is detected at various scales in the Universe. In this document, I will briefly review our knowledge on polarized radio sources in galaxy clusters and at their outskirts, emphasizing the crucial information provided by the polarized signal on the origin and evolution of such sources. Successively, I will focus on Abell 2255, which is known in the literature as the first cluster for which filamentary polarized emission associated with the radio halo has been detected. By using RM synthesis on our multi-wavelength WSRT observations, we studied the 3-dimensional geometry of the cluster, unveiling the nature of the polarized filaments at the borders of the central radio halo. Our analysis points out that these structures are relics lying at large distance from the cluster center.</p>

				<title>ATLAS, and Wide-Angle Tail Galaxies in ATLAS</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0585-0588</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), ATLAS (Australia Telescope Large Area Survey) is imaging two fields totalling 7 square degrees down to 10 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz. We have found 6 wide-angle tail galaxies (WATs), 4 of which have sufficient data to identify associated galaxy overdensities. The largest WAT, at a red-shift of 0.22, appears to be associated with an overdensity of galaxies that is spread over an unusually large extent of 12Mpc, with a velocity range of 4500 km s$^{-1}$. Here we present the WATs in ATLAS and discuss the implications of these observations for future large-scale radio surveys such as ASKAP-EMU.</p>

				<title>LOFAR: Recent Imaging Results and Future Prospects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0589-0598</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) is under construction in the Netherlands and in several surrounding European countries. In this contribution, we describe the layout and design of the telescope, with particular emphasis on the imaging characteristics of the array when used in its ‘standard imaging’ mode. After briefly reviewing the calibration and imaging software used for LOFAR image processing, we show some recent results from the ongoing imaging commissioning efforts. We conclude by summarizing future prospects for the use of LOFAR in observing the little-explored low-frequency Universe.</p>

				<title>Evolutionary Map of the Universe: Tracing Clusters to High Red-shift</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0599-0607</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is a new radio-telescope being built in Western Australia. One of the key surveys for which it is being built is EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe), which will make a deep ($\sim 10$ $\mu$Jy/bm rms) radio continuum survey covering the entire sky as far North as +30$^{\circ}$. EMU may be compared to the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), except that it will have about 45 times the sensitivity, and five times the resolution. EMU will also have much better sensitivity to diffuse emission than previous large surveys, and is expected to produce a large catalogue of relics, tailed galaxies, and halos, and will increase the number of known clusters by a significant factor. Here we describe the EMU project and its impact on the astrophysics of clusters.</p>

				<title>High-Redshift Radio Galaxies from Deep Fields</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0609-0612</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most of the radio galaxies with $z \gt 3$ have been found using the red-shift spectral index correlation.We have started a programme with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to exploit this correlation at flux density levels about 100 times deeper than the known high-redshift radio galaxies, with an aim to detect candidate high-redshift radio galaxies. Here we present results from the deep 150 MHz observations of LBDS-Lynx field, which has been imaged at 327, 610 and 1412 MHz with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and at 1400 and 4860 MHz with the Very Large Array (VLA). We find about 150 radio sources with spectra steeper than 1. About two-thirds of these are not detected in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), hence are strong candidate high-redshift radio galaxies, which need to be further explored with deep infra-red imaging and spectroscopy to estimate the red-shift.</p>

				<title>Deep GMRT 150 MHz Observations of the DEEP2 Fields: Searching for High Red-Shift Radio Galaxies Revisited</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0613-0614</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High red-shift radio galaxies are best searched at low radio frequencies, due to its steep radio spectra. Here we present preliminary results from our programme to search for high red-shift radio galaxies to $\sim 10$ to 100 times fainter than the known population till date. We have extracted ultra-steep spectrum (USS) samples from deep 150 MHz Giant Meter-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations from one of the three well-studied DEEP2 fields to this effect. From correlating these radio sources with respect to the high-frequency catalogues such as VLA, FIRST and NVSS at 1.4 GHz, we find $\sim 100$ steep spectrum (spectral index, $\alpha \gt 1$) radio sources, which are good candidates for high red-shift radio galaxies.</p>
