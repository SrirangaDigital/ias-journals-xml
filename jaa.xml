				<title>A Measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature at 1280MHz</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The absolute temperature of the cosmic microwave back-ground (CMB) has been measured at a frequency of 1280 MHz. The observation was made with a modified version of the L-band receiver used in the Giant Metre wavelength Radio Telescope (GMRT): the feed horn was replaced by a corrugated plate and the receiver was placed on the ground, directed at zenith, and shielded from ground radiation by an aluminium screen with corrugated edges. Novel techniques have been adopted for</p>
					<ul>
						<li>reducing and cancelling unwanted contributions to the system temperature of the receiver and</li>
						<li>calibrating the contributions from the feed assembly and receiver.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The thermodynamic temperature of the CMB is estimated to be $3.45 \pm 0.78$ K.</p>

				<title>Nature of the Background Ultraviolet Radiation Field at High Redshifts</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0019-0027</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have tried to determine the flux of the ultraviolet background radiation field from the column density ratios of various ions in several absorption systems observed in the spectra of QSOs. We find that in most cases the flux is considerably higher than what has been estimated to be contributed by the AGNs. The excess flux could originate locally in hot stars. In a few cases we have been able to show that such galactic flux can only contribute a part of the total required flux. The results suggest that the background gets a significant contribution from an unseen QSO population.</p>

				<title>X-ray Observation of XTE J2012+381 during the 1998 Outburst</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0029-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The outburst of X-ray transient source XTE J2012+381 was detected by the RXTE All-Sky Monitor on 1998 May 24th. Following the outburst, X-ray observations of the source were made in the 2-18keV energy band with the Pointed Proportional Counters of the Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment (IXAE) on-board the Indian satellite IRS-P3 during 1998 June 2nd-10th. The X-ray flux of the source in the main outburst decreased exponentially during the period of observation. No large amplitude short-term variability in the intensity is detected from the source. The power density spectrum obtained from the timing analysis of the data shows no indication of any quasi-periodic oscillations in 0.002-0.5 Hz band. The hardness ratio i.e. the ratio of counts in 6-18 keV to 2-6 keV band, indicates that the X-ray spectrum is soft with spectral index $\gt$ 2. From the similarities of the X-ray properties with those of other black hole transients, we conclude that the X-ray transient XTE J2012+381 is likely to be a black hole.</p>

These new near-infrared data provide insight into the structure of the thin disk of our Galaxy, The interpretation of star counts and color distributions of stars in the near-infrared with the synthetic stellar population model, gives strong evidence that the Galactic thin disk density scale length, $h_{R}$, is rather short ($2.7 \pm 0.1$ kpc).</p>

				<title>Stellar Sources in the ISOGAL Inner Galactic Bulge Field $(l=0^{0},b=-1^{0})$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0077-0090</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>ISOGAL is a survey at 7 and 15 μm with ISOCAM of the inner galactic disk and bulge of our Galaxy. The survey covers $\sim 22$ deg$^{2}$ in selected areas of the central $l=\pm 30$ degree of the inner Galaxy. In this paper, we report the study of a small ISOGAL field in the inner galactic bulge ($l = 0^{0},b = -1^{0}$, area = 0.033deg$^{2}$). Using the multicolor near-infrared data (IJK$_{s}$) of DENIS (DEep Near Infrared Southern Sky Survey) and mid-infrared ISOGAL data, we discuss the nature of the ISOGAL sources. The various color-color and color-magnitude diagrams are discussed in the paper. While most of the detected sources are red giants (RGB tip stars), a few of them show an excess in J-K$_{s}$ and K$_{s}$-[15] colors with respect to the red giant sequence. Most of them are probably AGB stars with large mass-loss rates.</p>

				<title>Porous and Fluffy Grains in the Regions of Anomalous Extinction</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0091-0099</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has long been established that the ratio of total to selective extinction is anomalously large (³ 5) in certain regions of the interstellar medium. In these regions of anomalous extinction the dust grains are likely to be irregular in shape and fluffy in structure. Using discrete dipole approximation (DDA) we calculate the extinction for porous and fluffy grains. We apply DDA first to solid spheroidal particles assumed to be made of a certain (large) number of dipoles. Then we systematically reduce the number of dipoles to model the porous grains. The aggregates of these particles are suggested to form the fluffy grains. We study the extinction for these particles as a function of grain size, porosity and wavelength. We apply these calculations to interpret the observed extinction data in the regions of star formation (e.g. the Orion complex).</p>

				<title>Results from Kodaikanal Synoptic Observations</title>
				<feature>Session II – Synoptic Observations</feature>
				<page>0149-0153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The synoptic observations of Kodaikanal form one of the longest unbroken solar data from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day, and consists of the white light and monochromatic images of the sun. In this review, I shall discuss the results of the investigations in two areas using these data:</p> 
					<ol type="roman">
						<li>Tilt angles of the magnetic axes of bipolar spot groups, and</li> 
						<li>structure and dynamics of large scale unipolar magnetic regions on the solar surface.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The observed properties and patterns of behaviour of the tilt angles can be used as effective diagnostics to infer the physical conditions in the subsurface layers of the sun, and thus get an insight into the physical effects that act on the rising magnetic flux tubes during their journey through the convection zone to the surface.</p>
					<p>The second topic of discussion here, namely, the studies of the dynamics of unipolar regions over several solar cycles, show that the global solar activity has a high latitude component which manifests in the form of polar faculae, in addition to the well known sunspot activity at the middle and low latitudes. This raises the question about the origin of this high latitude component.</p>

				<title>22-Year Periodicity in the Solar Differential Rotation</title>
				<feature>Session III – Sunspots &amp; Solar Cycle</feature>
				<page>0167-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the data on sunspot groups compiled during 1879-1975, we determined variations in the differential rotation coefficients $A$ and $Β$ during the solar cycle. The variation in the equatorial rotation rate $A$ is found to be significant only in the odd numbered cycles, with an amplitude $\sim 0.01$ $\mu$rads$^{-1}$. There exists a good anticorrelation between the variations of the differential rotation rate $Β$ derived from the odd and even numbered cycles, suggesting existence of a '22-year' periodicity in $B$. The amplitude of the variation of $Β$ is $\sim 0.05$ $\mu$ rad s$^{-1}$.</p>

					<p>We report here a study of various solar activity phenomena occurring in both north and south hemispheres of the Sun during solar cycles 8-23. In the study we have used sunspot data for the period 1832—1976, flare index data for the period 1936-1993, H$\alpha$ flare data 1993-1998 and solar active prominences data for the period 1957-1998. Earlier Verma reported long-term cyclic period in N-S asymmetry and also that the N-S asymmetry of solar activity phenomena during solar cycles 21, 22, 23 and 24 will be south dominated and the N-S asymmetry will shift to north hemisphere in solar cycle 25. The present study shows that the N-S asymmetry during solar cycles 22 and 23 are southern dominated as suggested by Verma.</p>

				<title>Solar Filaments as Tracers of Subsurface Processes</title>
				<feature>Session IV – Filaments &amp; Coronal Structures</feature>
				<page>0177-0183</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solar filaments are discussed in terms of two contrasting paradigms. The standard paradigm is that filaments are formed by condensation of coronal plasma into magnetic fields that are twisted or dimpled as a consequence of motions of the fields' sources in the photo-sphere. According to a new paradigm, filaments form in rising, twisted flux ropes and are a necessary intermediate stage in the transfer to interplanetary space of dynamo-generated magnetic flux. It is argued that the accumulation of magnetic helicity in filaments and their coronal surroundings leads to filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections. These ejections relieve the Sun of the flux generated by the dynamo and make way for the flux of the next cycle.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The solar corona - one of the most spectacular celestial shows and yet one of the most challenging puzzles - exhibits a spectrum of structures related to both the quiet Sun and active regions. In spite of dramatic differences in appearance and physical processes, all these structures share a common origin: they are all related to the solar magnetic field. The origin of the field is beneath the turbulent convection zone, where the magnetic field is not a master but a slave, and one can wonder how much the coronal magnetic field "remembers" its dynamo origin. Surprisingly, it does. We will describe several observational phenomena that indicate a close relationship between coronal and sub-photospheric processes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present an analysis of short time-scale intensity variations in the coronal green line as obtained with high time resolution observations. The observed data can be divided into two groups. The first one shows periodic intensity variations with a period of 5 min. the second one does not show any significant intensity variations. We studied the relation between regions of coronal intensity oscillations and the shape of whitelight coronal structures. We found that the coronal green-line oscillations occur mainly in regions where open white-light coronal structures are located.</p>

				<feature>Session IV – Filaments &amp; Coronal Structures</feature>
				<page>0201-0204</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Long-term cyclic variations in the distribution of prominences and intensities of green (530.3 nm) and red (637.4 nm) coronal emission lines over solar cycles 18-23 are presented. Polar prominence branches will reach the poles at different epochs in cycle 23: the north branch at the beginning in 2002 and the south branch a year later (2003), respectively. The local maxima of intensities in the green line show both poleward- and equatorward-migrating branches. The poleward branches will reach the poles around' cycle maxima like prominences, while the equatorward branches show a duration of 18 years and will end in cycle minima (2007). The red corona shows mostly equatorward branches. The possibility that these branches begin to develop at high latitudes in the preceding cycles cannot be excluded.</p>

					<p>Precise measurements of heliographic position of solar filaments were used for determination of the proper motion of solar filaments on the time-scale of days. The filaments have a tendency to make a shaking or waving of the external structure and to make a general movement of whole filament body, coinciding with the transport of the magnetic flux in the photosphere. The velocity scatter of individual measured points is about one order higher than the accuracy of measurements.</p>

					<p>A comparison is made of observational data on the mean magnetic field of the Sun from several observatories (a selection of published information and new measurements). Results of correlation and regression analyses of observations of background magnetic fields at the STOP telescope of the Sayan solar observatory in different spectral lines are also presented. Results obtained furnish an opportunity to obtain more unbiased information about large-scale magnetic fields of the Sun and, in particular, about manifestations of strong (kilogauss) magnetic fields in them.</p>

				<page>0213-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Observations of the strength and spatial distribution of vector magnetic fields in active regions have revealed several fundamental properties of the twist of their magnetic fields. First, the handedness of this twist obeys a hemispheric rule: left-handed in the northern hemisphere, right-handed in the southern. Second, the rule is weak; active regions often disobey it. It is statistically valid only in a large ensemble. Third, the rule itself, and the amplitude of the scatter about the rule, are quantitatively consistent with twisting of fields by turbulence as flux tubes buoy up through the convection zone. Fourth, there is considerable spatial variation of twist within active regions. However, relaxation to a linear force-free state, which has been documented amply in laboratory plasmas, is not observed.</p>

					<p>Solar flares, prominences and CMEs are well known manifestations of solar activity. For many years, qualitative studies were made about the cyclical behaviour of such phenomena. Nowadays, more quantitative studies have been undertaken with the aim to understand the solar cycle dependence of such phenomena as well as peculiar behaviour, such as asymmetries and periodicities, occurring within the solar cycle. Here, we plan to review the more recent research concerning all these topics.</p>

				<page>0233-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The active region NOAA 8032 of April 15, 1997 was observed to evolve rapidly. The GOES X-ray data showed a number of sub-flares and two C-class flares during the 8-9 hours of its evolution. The magnetic evolution of this region is studied to ascertain its role in flare production. Large changes were observed in magnetic field configuration due to the emergence of new magnetic flux regions (EFR). Most of the new emergence occured very close to the existing magnetic regions, which resulted in strong magnetic field gradients in this region. EFR driven reconnection of the field lines and subsequent flux cancellation might be the reason for the continuous occurrence of sub-flares and other related activities.</p>

				<title>On the Possibility of Radio Emission from Quasi-parallel and Quasi-perpendicular Propagation of Shocks</title>
				<feature>Session V – Vector Magnetic Fields, Prominences, CMEs &amp; Flares</feature>
				<page>0259-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A set of 21 solar type II radio bursts observed using Hiraiso radio spectrograph have been analysed to study the direction of propagation of coronal shocks. Α simple analysis is carried out to find the approximate angle between the shock normal and magnetic field by solving the Rankine-Hugoniot MHD relation with assumption of Alfven speed and plasma beta. From this analysis, it is suggested that both quasi-parallel shocks (favourable) and quasi-perpendicular shocks can generate type II bursts depending upon the circumstances of the corona.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A gradient based algorithm which divides arbitrary images into non-overlapping surface filling tiles of opposite polarity is used to study the flux and size distributions of large scale magnetic flux concentrations in solar and heliospheric observatory (SoHO) magnetograms. The mean absolute flux and size of the concentrations at the considered scale is found to be about $1.7 \times 10^{18}$Mx and 5.2Mm for both polarities. The form of the flux distribution is characterized by a skewness of $\alpha_{3} = 4.9$ and a kurtosis of $\alpha_{4}$, = 42.8. The fall in the distribution in the range $6.5 \times 10^{17}$Mx to $5 \times 10^{18}$Mx is described by an exponential fit, in agreement with a model for the sustenance of quiet region flux.</p>

				<page>0275-0282</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At the solar surface the magnetic field is bundled into discrete elements of concentrated flux, often referred to as magnetic flux tubes, which cover only a small fraction of the solar surface. Flux tubes span a whole spectrum of sizes, ranging from sunspots to features well below the best currently obtainable spatial resolution.</p>
					<p>Whereas sunspots have been well studied, our knowledge of the true brightness of small-scale magnetic features is hampered by the insufficient spatial resolution of the observations. A better understanding of the thermal and magnetic properties of these small-scale features, however, is crucial for an understanding of (climate-relevant) long-term solar irradiance variations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We model the dynamical interaction between magnetic flux tubes and granules in the solar photosphere which leads to the excitation of transverse (kink) and longitudinal (sausage) tube waves. The investigation is motivated by the interpretation of network oscillations in terms of flux tube waves. The calculations show that for magnetic field strengths typical of the network, the energy flux in transverse waves is higher than in longitudinal waves by an order of magnitude. But for weaker fields, such as those that might be found in internetwork regions, the energy fluxes in the two modes are comparable. Using observations of footpoint motions, the energy flux in transverse waves is calculated and the implications for chromospheric heating are pointed out.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Simultaneous time series of broad-band images of two active regions close to the disk center were acquired at the maximum (0.80 $\mu$m) and minimum (1.55 $\mu$m) continuum opacities. Dark faculae are detected in images obtained as weighted intensity differences between both wave-length bands. The elements of quiet regions can be clearly distinguished from those of faculae and pores in scatter plots of brightness temperatures. There is a smooth transition between faculae and pores in the scatter plots. These facts are interpreted in terms of the balance between the inhibition of convective energy transport and the lateral radiative heating.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>To identify and understand the underlying physical mechanisms of total solar and UV irradiance variability and to estimate the contribution of various chromospheric features to UV irradiance, detailed analysis of spatially resolved data is required. The various chromospheric features have been segregated and different parameters have been derived from CaII Κ Spectroheliograms of NSO/Sac Peak and Kodaikanal Observatory and compared with UV irradiance flux measured in MgII h and k lines by NOAA 9 satellite. The important results of this detailed analysis of CaII Κ Images of 1992 together with UV irradiance data will be discussed in this paper.</p>

The constraints of conservation of mass, energy, angular momentum, cross-helicity and relative magnetic helicity are imposed. Equilibria corresponding to the energy extrema while conserving these invariants for parallel flows yield three classes of solutions and one of them with an increasing radial density profile, relevant to solar flux tubes is presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We compute the signs of two different current helicity parameters (i.e., $\alpha_{\text{best}}$ and $H_{c}$) for 87 active regions during the rise of cycle 23. The results indicate that 59\%\ of the active regions in the northern hemisphere have negative $\alpha_{\text{best}}$ and 65\%\ in the southern hemisphere have positive. This is consistent with that of the cycle 22. However, the helicity parameter $H_{c}$ shows a weaker opposite hemispheric preference in the new solar cycle. Possible reasons are discussed.</p>

					<p>Horizontal large-scale velocity field describes horizontal displacement of the photospheric magnetic flux in zonal and meridian directions. The flow systems of solar plasma, constructed according to the velocity field, create the large-scale cellular-like patterns with up-flow in the center and the down-flow on the boundaries. Distribution of the large-scale horizontal eddies (with characteristic scale length from 350 to 490 Mm) was found in the broad equatorial zone, limited by $60^{\circ}$ latitude circles on both hemispheres. The zonal averages of the zonal and meridian velocities, and the total horizontal velocity for each Carrington rotation during the activity cycles no. 21 and 22 varies during the 11-yr activity cycle. Plot of RMS values of total horizontal velocity is shifted about 1·6 years before the similarly shaped variation of the magnetic flux.</p>

				<feature>Session VIII – Helioseismology</feature>
				<page>0323-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The inversion of helioseismic modes leads to the sound velocity inside the Sun with a precision of about 0.1 per cent. Comparisons of solar models with the "seismic sun" represent powerful tools to test the physics: depth of the convection zone, equation of state, opacities, element diffusion processes and mixing inside the radiative zone. We now have evidence that microscopic diffusion (element segregation) does occur below the convection zone, leading to a mild helium depletion in the solar outer layers. Meanwhile this process must be slowed down by some macroscopic effect, presumably rotation-induced mixing. The same mixing is also responsible for the observed lithium depletion. On the other hand, the observations of beryllium and helium 3 impose specific constraints on the depth of this mildly mixed zone. Helioseismology also gives information on the internal solar rotation: while differential rotation exists in the convection zone, solid rotation prevails in the radiative zone, and the transition layer (the so-called "tachocline") is very small. These effects are discussed, together with the astrophysical constraints on the solar neutrino fluxes.</p>

					<p>The interior of the Sun is not directly accessible to observations. Nonetheless, it is possible to infer the physical conditions inside the Sun with the help of structure equations governing its equilibrium and with the powerful observational tools provided by the neutrino fluxes and oscillation frequencies. The helioseismic data show that the internal constitution of the Sun can be adequately represented by a standard solar model. It turns out that a cooler solar core is not a viable solution for the measured deficit of neutrino fluxes, and the resolution of the solar neutrino puzzle should be sought in the realm of particle physics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using intermediate degree p-mode frequency data sets for solar cycle 22, we find that the frequency shifts and magnetic activity indicators show a "hysteresis" phenomenon. It is observed that the magnetic indices follow different paths for the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle while for radiative indices, the separation between the paths are well within the error limits.</p>

				<title>Non-Radial Oscillations in an Axisymmetric MHD Incompressible Fluid</title>
				<feature>Session VIII – Helioseismology</feature>
				<page>0361-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well known from Helioseismology that the Sun exhibits oscillations on a global scale, most of which are non-radial in nature. These oscillations help us to get a clear picture of the internal structure of the Sun as has been demonstrated by the theoretical and observational (such as GONG) studies. In this study we formulate the linearised equations of motion for non-radial oscillations by perturbing the MHD equilibrium solution for an axisymmetric incompressible fluid. The fluid motion and the magnetic field are expressed as scalars $U$, $V$, $Ρ$ and $T$, respectively. In deriving the exact solution for the equilibrium state, we neglect the contribution due to meridional circulation. The perturbed quantities $U_{\ast}$, $V_{\ast}$, $Ρ_{\ast}$, $T_{\ast}$ are written in terms of orthogonal polynomials. A special case of the above formulation and its stability is discussed.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of Cyclically Polarity Reversing Solar Magnetic Cycle as a Cosmic Dynamo</title>
				<feature>Session IX – Dynamo Mechanisms </feature>
				<page>0365-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We briefly describe historical development of the concept of solar dynamo mechanism that generates electric current and magnetic field by plasma flows inside the solar convection zone. The dynamo is the driver of the cyclically polarity reversing solar magnetic cycle. The reversal process can easily and visually be understood in terms of magnetic field line stretching and twisting and folding in three-dimensional space by plasma flows of differential rotation and global convection under influence of Coriolis force. This process gives rise to formation of a series of huge magnetic flux tubes that propagate along iso-rotation surfaces inside the convection zone. Each of these flux tubes produces one solar cycle. We discuss general characteristics of any plasma flows that can generate magnetic field and reverse the polarity of the magnetic field in a rotating body in the Universe. We also mention a list of problems which are currently being disputed concerning the solar dynamo mechanism together with observational evidences that are to be constraints as well as verifications of any solar cycle dynamo theories of short and long term behaviors of the Sun, particularly time variations of its magnetic field, plasma flows, and luminosity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This review provides a historical overview of how research in kinematic solar dynamo modeling evolved during the last few decades and assesses the present state of research. The early pioneering papers assumed the dynamo to operate in the convection zone. It was suggested in the 1980s that the dynamo operates in a thin layer at the bottom of the convection zone. Some researchers in recent years are arguing that the poloidal field is produced near the surface—an idea that goes back to Babcock (1961) and Leighton (1969).</p>

				<page>0423-0429</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The cyclic evolution of the heliospheric plasma parameters is related to the time-dependent boundary conditions in the solar corona. "Minimal" coronal configurations correspond to the regular appearance of the tenuous, but hot and fast plasma streams from the large polar coronal holes. The denser, but cooler and slower solar wind is adjacent to coronal streamers. Irregular dynamic manifestations are present in the corona and the solar wind everywhere and always. They follow the solar activity cycle rather well. Because of this, the direct and indirect solar wind measurements demonstrate clear variations in space and time according to the minimal, intermediate and maximal conditions of the cycles. The average solar wind density, velocity and temperature measured at the Earth's orbit show specific decadal variations and trends, which are of the order of the first tens per cent during the last three solar cycles. Statistical, spectral and correlation characteristics of the solar wind are reviewed with the emphasis on the cycles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The heliosphere is the region filled with magnetized plasma of mainly solar origin. It extends from the solar corona to well beyond the planets, and is separated from the interstellar medium by the heliopause. The latter is embedded in a complex and still unexplored boundary region. The characteristics of heliospheric plasma, fields, and energetic particles depend on highly variable internal boundary conditions, and also on quasi-stationary external ones. Both galactic cosmic rays and energetic particles of solar and heliospheric origin are subject to intensity variations over individual solar cycles and also from cycle to cycle. Particle propagation is controlled by spatially and temporally varying interplanetary magnetic fields, frozen into the solar wind. An overview is presented of the main heliospheric components and processes, and also of the relevant missions and data sets. Particular attention is given to flux variations over the last few solar cycles, and to extrapolated effects on the terrestrial environment.</p>

				<title>Remote Sensing of the Heliospheric Solar Wind using Radio Astronomy Methods and Numerical Simulations</title>
				<feature>Session XI – Solar Wind &amp; Interplanetary Magnetic Fields</feature>
				<page>0439-0444</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ground-based radio astronomy method of interplanetary scintillations (IPS) and spacecraft observations have shown, in the past 25 years, that while coronal holes give rise to stable, recurring high speed solar wind streams during the minimum of the solar activity cycle, the slow speed wind seen more during the solar maximum activity is better associated with the closed field regions, which also give rise to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME's). The latter events increase significantly, as the cycle maximum takes place. We have recently shown that in the case of energetic flares one may be able to track the associated disturbances almost on a one to one basis from a distance of 0.2 to 1 AU using IPS methods. Time dependent 3D MHD models which are constrained by IPS observations are being developed. These models are able to simulate general features of the solar-generated disturbances. Advances in this direction may lead to prediction of heliospheric propagation of these disturbances throughout the solar system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Ulysses Unified Radio and Plasma Wave Experiment (URAP) has observed Langmuir, ion-acoustic and associated solar type III radio emissions in the interplanetary medium. Bursts of 50-300 Hz (in the spacecraft frame) electric field signals, corresponding to long-wavelength ion-acoustic waves are often observed coincident in time with the most intense Langmuir wave spikes, providing evidence for the electrostatic decay instability. Langmuir waves often occur as envelope solitons, suggesting that strong turbulence processes, such as modulational instability and soliton formation, often coexist with weak turbulence processes, such as electrostatic decay, in a few type III burst source regions.</p>

					<p>This summary lecture makes no attempt to summarize what was actually said at the meeting, since this is well covered by the other contributors. Instead I have structured my presentation in three parts: First I try to demonstrate why the Sun is unique by comparing it with laboratory plasmas. This is followed by some personal reminiscences that go back a significant fraction of the century. I conclude in the form of a poem about this memorable conference in honor of the centennial anniversary of the Kodaikanal Observatory.</p>

				<title>Hard X-ray Spectrum of Mkn 421 during the Active Phase</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0145-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spectral measurement of Mkn 421 were made in the hard X-ray energy band of 20–200 keV using a high sensitivity, large area scintillation counter telescope on November 21, 2000 and these coincided with the onset of an active X-ray phase as seen in the ASM counting rates on board RXTE. The observed spectrum can not be fitted to a single power law similar to the PDS data of BeppoSAX. The data can be fitted both by a two component power-law function or a combination of an exponential function with a power law component at the high energies above 80 keV. We identify these components with those arising from the synchrotron self compton and the high energy power-law tail arising from the upgrading of the thermal photons due to multiple Compton scattering a la Cyg X-1. A comparison with the earlier data clearly suggests a spectral variability in the hard X-ray spectrum of the source. We propose a continuously flaring geometry for the source as the underlying mechanism for energy release.</p>

				<page>0155-0172</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present broad band $R$ and narrow band H$\alpha$ emission line images of a sample of optically selected starburst galaxies from the Markarian lists. The emission line morphology is studied and global properties like luminosities, equivalent widths and star formation rates are derived. The radial distribution of H$\alpha$ flux and the EW are determined using concentric aperture photometry on the emission line and the continuum images. H$\alpha$ flux is generally found to peak in the nuclear region and fall off outwards. The EW is found to peak off-center in most of the cases implying that though the intensity of emission is maximum at the nucleus, the star formation activity relative to the underlying continuum often peaks away from the center in Markarian starburst galaxies.</p>

				<page>0173-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three Galactic star forming regions associated with W3(OH), S209 and S187 have been simultaneously mapped in two trans-IRAS far infrared (FIR) bands centered at $\sim 140$ and 200$\mu$m using the TIFR 100 cm balloon borne FIR telescope. These maps showextended FIR emission with structures. The HIRES processed IRAS maps of these regions at 12, 25, 60 &amp; 100 $\mu$m have also been presented for comparison. Point-like sources have been extracted from the longest waveband TIFR maps and searched for associations in the other five bands. The diffuse emission from these regions have been quantified, which turns out to be a significant fraction of the total emission. The spatial distribution of cold dust (T $\lt$ 30 K) for two of these sources (W3(OH) &amp; S209), has been determined reliably from the maps in TIFR bands. The dust temperature and optical depth maps show complex morphology. In general the dust around S209 has been found to be warmer than that in W3(OH) region.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The four stars treated in this paper have been under observation with photoelectric radial-velocity spectrometers for many years. They have proved to be binaries with periods of 30, 1828, 1514 and 822 days respectively; the orbits are of modest eccentricity apart from that of HD 110743 which is indistinguishable from a circle. The mass functions are small, and no companion has been observed for any of the stars. HD 110743, a K dwarf, is much the nearest of the four, and its orbit is of short enough period for the photocentric motion to have been recognized by <i>Hipparcos</i>. An eleventh-magnitude star rather more than $1'$ away from HD 106104 is shown to be a genuine physical companion, with practically identical radial velocity, proper motion and distance modulus, although the projected separation is about 13,000 AU.</p>

				<title>Detection, Excision and Statistics of Interference at the Mauritius Radio Telescope</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0213-0227</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A technique to detect man-made interference in the visibility data of the Mauritius Radio Telescope (MRT) has been developed. This technique is based on the understanding that the interference is generally ‘spiky’ in nature and has Fourier components beyond the maximum frequency which can arise from the radio sky and can therefore be identified. We take the sum of magnitudes of visibilities on all the baselines measured at a given time to improve detectability. This is then high-pass filtered to get a time series from which the contribution of the sky is removed. Interference is detected in the high-pass data using an iterative scheme. In each iteration, interference with amplitudes beyond a certain threshold is detected. These points are then removed from the original time series and the resulting data are high-pass filtered and the process repeated. We have also studied the statistics of the strength, numbers, time of occurrence and duration of the interference at the MRT. The statistics indicate that most often the interference excision can be carried out while post-integrating the visibilities by giving a zero weight to the interference points.</p>

				<title>Variability of Extragalactic Objects in Relation to Redshift, Color, Radio Spectral Index and Absorption Lines</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0263-0282</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optical variability of extragalactic objects, viz., QSOs, BL Lacs and Seyfert galaxies has been monitored systematically over an appreciable period of time and a large amount of data have accumulated. The present work reports results of investigations involving statistical analysis of updated data on relationships between variability and various observed properties of the objects, viz., redshift, color indices, radio spectral index and absorption lines. It is found that at high frequencies (rest frame) radio spectral index does not change significantly with the degree of variability. However, the degree of variability depends on redshifts. On the other hand, presence or absence of absorption lines is significantly associated with variability for QSOs with larger redshifts ($z \gt 1.0$), while no such relationship exists for QSOs at smaller redshifts ($z \lt 1.0$ or other objects. Correlation between color indices and redshifts depends on the degree of variability and the sample chosen for the color index.</p>

					<p>We present the results from ROSAT observations of 3C273 in the soft X-ray band. The light variation of 3C273 was investigated for three different energy bands of soft, medium, and hard. The maximum variability with a factor of 2 for 551 dayswas confirmed at all three different bands. This appears to be a periodic variation within the period of roughly 6 months. However, the short-term or micro variation was not so distinct and the light variation of each band did not show any correlation between them. The hardness ratio for hard and soft bands shows irregular variation but there was no correlation between them. There is no distinct variation of the photon index in the case of simple power law model fitting. For power law + free absorption model fitting, the average photon index $(\Gamma)$ is 2.08.</p>

				<title>HI Fluctuations at Large Redshifts: I–Visibility correlation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0293-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the possibility of probing the large scale structure in the universe at large redshifts by studying fluctuations in the redshifted 1420 MHz emission from the neutral hydrogen (HI) at early epochs. The neutral hydrogen content of the universe is knownfrom absorption studies for $z \lesssim 4.5$. The HI distribution is expected to be inhomogeneous in the gravitational instability picture and this inhomogeneity leads to anisotropy in the redshifted HI emission. The best hope of detecting this anisotropy is by using a large low-frequency interferometric instrument like the Giant Meter-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We calculate the visibility correlation function $\langle V_{v}(\mathbf{U})V_{v'}(\mathbf{U})\rangle$ at two frequencies $v$ and $v'$ of the redshifted HI emission for an interferometric observation. In particular we give numerical results for the two GMRT channels centered around $v=325$ MHz and $v=610$ MHz from density inhomogeneity and peculiar velocity of the HI distribution. The visibility correlation is $\simeq 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ Jy$^{2}$. We calculate the signal-to-noise for detecting the correlation signal in the presence of system noise and show that the GMRT might detect the signal for integration times $\simeq 100$ hrs. We argue that the measurement of visibility correlation allows optimal use of the uncorrelated nature of the system noise across baselines and frequency channels.</p>

				<title>A Map for a Group of Resonant Cases in a Quartic Galactic Hamiltonian</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0309-0319</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a map for the study of resonant motion in a potential made up of two harmonic oscillators with quartic perturbing terms. This potential can be considered to describe motion in the central parts of non-rotating elliptical galaxies. The map is based on the averaged Hamiltonian. Adding on a semi-empirical basis suitable terms in the unperturbed averaged Hamiltonian, corresponding to the $1:1$ resonant case, we are able to construct a map describing motion in several resonant cases. The map is used in order to find the $x- p_{x}$ Poincare phase plane for each resonance. Comparing the results of the map, with those obtained by numerical integration of the equation of motion, we observe, that the map describes satisfactorily the broad features of orbits in all studied cases for regular motion. There are cases where the map describes satisfactorily the properties of the chaotic orbits as well.</p>

				<title>Real-Time Signal Processor for Pulsar Studies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0321-0342</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the design, tests and preliminary results of a real-time parallel signal processor built to aid a wide variety of pulsar observations. The signal processor reduces the distortions caused by the effects of dispersion, Faraday rotation, doppler acceleration and parallactic angle variations, at a sustained data rate of 32 Msamples/sec. It also folds the pulses coherently over the period and integrates adjacent samples in time and frequency to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting data are recorded for further off-line analysis of the characteristics of pulsars and the intervening medium. The signal processing for analysis of pulsar signals is quite complex, imposing the need for a high computational throughput, typically of the order of a Giga operations per second (GOPS). Conventionally, the high computational demand restricts the flexibility to handle only a few types of pulsar observations. This instrument is designed to handle a wide variety of Pulsar observations with the Giant Metre Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT), and is flexible enough to be used in many other high-speed, signal processing applications. The technology used includes field-programmable-gate-array(FPGA) based data/code routing interfaces, PC-AT based control, diagnostics and data acquisition, digital signal processor (DSP) chip based parallel processing nodes and C language based control software and DSP-assembly programs for signal processing. The architecture and the software implementation of the parallel processor are fine-tuned to realize about 60 MOPS per DSP node and a multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) capability.</p>

				<title>Seismic View of the Solar Interior</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interior of the Sun is not directly observable to us. Nevertheless, it is possible to infer the physical conditions prevailing in the solar interior with the help of theoretical models coupled with observational input provided by measured frequencies of solar oscillations. The frequencies of these solar oscillations depend on the internal structure and dynamics of the Sun and from the knowledge of these frequencies it is possible to infer the internal structure as well as the large scale flows inside the Sun, in the same way as the observations of seismic waves on the surface of Earth help us in the study of its interior. With the accumulation of seismic data over the last six years it has also become possible to study temporal variations in the solar interior. Some of these seismic inferences would be described.</p>

				<title>Photometric Variability of Four Coronally Active Stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0009-0014</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present photometric observations of four stars that are optical counterparts of soft X-ray/EUV sources, namely 1ES 0829+15.9, 1ES0920-13.6, 2RE J110159+223509 and 1ES 1737+61.2. We have discovered periodic variability in two of the stars, viz., MCC 527 (1ES 0829+15.9; Period = 0$^{d}$.828 $\pm$ 0.0047) and HD 81032 (1ES 0920-13.6; Period = $\sim 57.02 \pm 0.560$ days). HD 95559 (2RE J110159+223509) is found to show a period of 3$^{d}$. HD 160934 (1ES1737+61.2) also shows photometric variability but needs to be monitored further for finding its period. These stars most likely belong to the class of chromospherically active stars.</p>

				<title>The Investigation of Nova-like Variable MV Lyr during the 1999–2001 Years</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0015-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A peculiar nova-like MV Lyr was investigated. The CCD-observations ofMVLyr were continued in Crimea during the outbursts and quiescent states. Last year its behavior became non-typical for “anti-dwarf novae”. The length of its first deep minimum was 10 years. A modern state is characterized by very strong outbursts and very often changes of the stages. The periods 0.$^{d}$d128 and 0.$^{d}$d136 were obtained for 1998 and 1999 years accordingly. Possibly, a relation between the photometric period and the brightness exists.</p>

				<title>High Energy Phenomena in Eta Carinae</title>

				<page>0019-0022</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated with BeppoSAX the long term behaviour of the harder X-ray component of the supposed supermassive binary system $\eta$ Car along its 5.52 year cycle. We have found that in March 1998 during egress from the last December 1997 eclipse, this component was the same as outside eclipse, but for a large $(\times 3.5)$ increase of NH$_{h}$, that can be attributed to the presence or formation of opaque matter in front of the source near periastron. Unexpectedly, at that time the iron 6.7 keV emission line was 40\%\ stronger. BeppoSAX has for the first time found a <i>hard X-ray tail</i> extending to at least 50 keV, that cannot be adequately fitted with an additional hotter thermal component. The 2–100 keV spectrum of $\eta$ Car is instead well fitted with an absorbed powerlaw spectrum with photon index 2.53, suggesting non-thermal emission as an alternative model for the core source.</p>

				<title>Upper Limits on O VI Emission from Voyager Observations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0023-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have examined 426 <i>Voyager</i> fields distributed across the sky for O VI ($\gamma\gamma$ 1032/1038 Å) emission from the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium. No such emission was detected in any of our observed fields. Our most constraining limit was a 90\%\ confidence upper limit of 2600 photons cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ on the doublet emission in the direction (l, b) = (117.3, 50.6). Combining this with an absorption line measurement in nearly the same direction allows us to place an upper limit of 0.01 cm$^{-3}$ on the electron density of the hot gas in this direction. We have placed 90\%\ confidence upper limits of less than or equal to 10,000 photons cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ on the O VI emission in 16 of our 426 observations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present spectral variations of the binary X-ray pulsar LMC X-4 observed with the RXTE/PCA during different phases of its 30.5 day long third period. Only out-of-eclipse data were used for this study. The 3–25 keV spectrum, modeled with high energy cut-off power-law and iron line emission is found to show strong dependence on the intensity state. Correlations between the Fe line emission flux and different parameters of the continuum are presented here.</p>

					<p>We report the discovery of a decay in the superorbital period of the binary X-ray pulsar LMC X-4. Combining archival data and published long term X-ray light curves, we have found a decay in the third period in this system ($P \sim 30.3$ day, $\dot{P}\sim -2\times 10^{-5}$ s s$^{-1}$). Along with this result, a comparison of the superorbital intensity variations in LMC X-4, Her X-1 and SMC X-1 is also presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The field of Very High Energy (VHE) gamma ray astronomy using the Atmospheric Cerenkov Technique has entered an interesting phase with detection of various galactic and extragalactic sources. Among galactic sources, only the Crab nebula has been established as a standard candle. Most observations on pulsars are in agreement as to the necessity for the GeV spectra to steepen at $\lt$ 200 GeV. While the Imaging method for increase of sensitivity has been successful with many results, an alternate technique – <i>Wavefront Sampling Technique</i> – is also being used by an increasing number of experiments. The recently commissioned experiment at Pachmarhi (PACT) in India is presented as an example of this technique. Preliminary results from this experiment show detection of VHE $\gamma$-ray emission from</p>

					<p>The on-going Parkes multibeam survey has been astoundingly successful (Manchester <i>et al.</i> 2001), and its discovery of over 600 pulsars has opened up new avenues for probing the Galaxy’s electron content and magnetic field. Here we report on recent observations made with the Arecibo 305-m telescope, where 80 distant, high dispersion measure pulsars (of which 35 are from the multibeam survey) were studied at multiple frequency bands in the range 0.4–2.4 GHz, in order to determine their scattering properties, rotation measures and spectral indices. The results will be used to meet a variety of science goals; viz., creating an improved model of the electron density, mapping out the Galactic magnetic field, and modeling the pulsar population.</p>

					<p>Several new features of X-ray binary pulsars are revealed from recent observations with ASCA, RXTE, BeppoSAX and other X-ray observatories. Among these, I will review in this paper some recent progress in spectroscopic studies of accreting X-ray pulsars in binary systems (XBPs). First, I will discuss soft excess features observed in the energy spectra of XBPs and propose that it is a common feature for various subclasses of XBPs. Next I will present some recent results of high resolution spectroscopy with ASCA and Chandra.</p>

					<p>This paper reviews the current status of the theoretical models of the evolution of the magnetic fields of neutron stars other than magnetars. It appears that the magnetic fields of neutron stars decay significantly only if they are in binary systems. Three major physical models for this, namely spindown-induced flux expulsion, ohmic evolution of crustal field and diamagnetic screening of the field by accreted plasma, are reviewed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The GRB monitor (GRBM) on board the Indian SROSS C-2 satellite has detected 53 classical gamma ray bursts since its launch in May, 1994 till its re-entry in July, 2001. For a subset of 26 events, locations were obtained from simultaneous observations by other gamma-ray detectors in space. The sky distribution of these 26 SROSS C-2 bursts is consistent with isotropy. The distribution of event durations shows evidence for bimodality. There is an evidence for a moderate hardness ratio-intensity (HIC) correlation in the data. The SROSS C-2 GRBM has also detected three episodes of emission from the SGR 1627-41.</p>

Multicolor X-ray imaging reveals new details of the outer shock and ejecta. At energies between 4 and 6 keV, the outline of the outer shock is clearly revealed in X-rays for the first time. The distribution of the emission from lines of Si and Fe are confirmed to have a different morphology from each other, and the Si ejecta are shown to extend to the blast shock at several locations. Characteristic spectra of the outer shock and ejecta are also presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study the possibility of quasar outflows in clusters and groups of galaxies heating the intracluster gas in order to explain the recent observation of excess entropy in this gas. We show that radio galaxies alone cannot provide the energy required to explain the observations but the inclusion of Broad Absorption Line (BAL) outflows can do so, and that in this scenario most of the heating takes place at $z\sim$ 1–4, the “preheating” epoch being at a lower redshift for lower mass clusters.</p>

				<title>CLASS B 1359 + 154: Modelling Lensing by a Group of Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0115-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The recently discovered gravitationally lensed system CLASS B1359+154 appears to have six detectable images of a single background source at a redshift of 3.235. A group of galaxies acts as the lens, at a redshift of $\sim 1$. The present work identifies two distinct, physically plausible image configurations, a 7-image one and a 9-image one. Mass models are constructed corresponding to realizations of these two configurations. Both models call for, in addition to non-singular galaxy-type lenses, a larger scale mass component that resembles the extended dark matter distributions seen in relatively low-redshift galaxy groups. It is presently observationally impossible to study the extended X-ray emission from a group at such a high redshift, hence lensing studies are of some interest. A lensed system with a high image multiplicity does not necessarily admit of a unique lensing interpretation; discrimination is possible with additional observable details (e.g., the image parities, which are uncommon among even the simpler systems).</p>

					<p>We have obtained $K$-band imaging observations of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) host galaxies with the near-infrared spectro-imager ISAAC installed on the Very Large Telescope at Paranal (Chile). The derived $K$ magnitudes, combined with other photometric data taken from the literature, are used to investigate the $R$–$K$ colors of GRB hosts. We do not find any extremely reddened starbursts in our sample, despite the capability of GRBs to trace star formation even in dusty regions. The observed $R$–$K$ colors are on the contrary typical of irregular and spiral blue galaxies at high redshift.</p>

					<p>This talk focuses on the various aspects we learnt from multiband observations of GRBs both, before and during the afterglow era. A statistical analysis to estimate the probable redshifts of host galaxies using the luminosity function of GRBs compatible with both the afterglow redshift data as well as the overall population of GRBs is discussed. We then address the question whether the observed fields of GRBs with precise localizations from third Inter-Planetary Network (IPN$^{3}$) contain suitable candidates for their host galaxies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Matter accreting onto black holes suffers a standing or oscillating shock wave in much of the parameter space. The post-shock region is hot, puffed up and reprocesses soft photons from a Keplerian disc to produce the characteristic hard tail of the spectrum of accretion discs. The post-shock torus is also the base of the bipolar jets. We study the interaction of these jets with the hard photons emitted from the disc. We show that radiative force can accelerate outflows but the drag can limit the terminal speed. We introduce an equilibrium speed $v_{eq}$ as a function of distance, above which the flow will experience radiative deceleration.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The structures of faint high redshift galaxies cannot be observed directly. But if a luminous quasar is located farther along their line of sight, high resolution absorption lines offer a valuable and reliable probe to their structure. GMRT is suited to monitor the absorption spectra, if the redshifted neutral hydrogen or OH doublet fall in one of the windows of the telescope. We present the OH doublet absorption spectra for the system B0218+357, taken at GMRT this year at resolution of approx. 9.5 km/sec with an rms noise of the order of 1 mJy. Based on our study of the OH doublet and 21cm neutral hydrogen line we infer that, in the lensing spiral galaxy of B0218+57, neutral hydrogen and OH coexist in tenous clouds and there is possibly a hole in the central part of the galaxy. In contrast, the gas is seen in high density clouds in the lens in an otherwise similar system PKS1830-211.</p>

					<p>We present connections between global and local parameters in a realistic dynamical model, describing motion in a barred galaxy. Expanding the global model in the vicinity of a stable Lagrange point, we find the potential of a two-dimensional perturbed harmonic oscillator, which describes local motion near the centre of the global model. The frequencies of oscillations and the coefficients of the perturbing terms are not arbitrary but are connected to the mass, the angular rotation velocity, the scale length and the strength of the galactic bar. The local energy is also connected to the global energy. A comparison of the properties of orbits in the global and local potential is also made.</p>

It combines the automatic inclusion of periodic boundary conditions of PM simulations with the high resolution of tree codes. This is done by splitting the gravitational force into a short range and a long range component.

				<title>Spectral Measurements of Cyg X-3: A Thermal Source Embedded in Hot Plasma within a Cold Shell</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0197-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The attempts at unified model fitting to explain the spectral variations in Cyg X-3 suggest equally probable fits with a combination of an absorbed blackbody and a separately absorbed power law with an exponential cut-off or a composite of absorbed free-free emission with a power law hard X-ray component apart from the iron emission line. These seemingly ordinary but ad hoc mixtures of simple X-ray emission mechanisms have a profound implication about the geometry of the X-ray source. While the first set suggests a black-hole nature of the compact object, the second combination is consistent with a neutron star binary picture. The spectral variability at hard X-ray energies above 30 keV can provide crucial input for the unified picture. In this paper, we present spectral observations of Cyg X-3, made in our on-going survey of galactic and extragalactic X-ray sources in the 20–200 keV energy region, using Large Area Scintillation counter Experiment. The data show a clear power-law photon spectrum of the form $\frac{{\rm d}N}{{\rm d}E}\sim E^{-2.8}$ in the 20 to 130 keVenergy range. Acomparison with earlier data suggests that the total number of X-ray photons in the entire 2–500 keV energy band is conserved at all time for a given luminosity level irrespective of the state. We propose that this behaviour can be explained by a simple geometry in which a thermal X-ray source is embedded in a hot plasma formed by winds from the accretion disk within a cold shell. The high/soft and low/hard X-ray states of the source are simply the manifestation of the extent of the surrounding scattering medium in which the seed photons are Comptonized and hot plasma can be maintained by either the X-ray driven winds or the magneto-centrifugal winds.</p>

				<title>Fast Transition between High-soft and Low-soft States in GRS 1915 + 105: Evidence for a Critically Viscous Accretion Flow</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0213-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results of a detailed analysis of RXTE observations of class $\omega$ (Klein-Wolt <i>et al.</i> 2002) which show an unusual state transition between high-soft and low-soft states in the Galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105. Out of about 600 pointed RXTE observations, the source was found to exhibit such state transition only on 16 occasions. An examination of the RXTE/ASM data in conjunction with the pointed observations reveals that these events appeared as a series of quasi-regular dips in two stretches of long duration (about 20 days during each occasion) when hard X-ray and radio flux were very low. The X-ray light curve and colour-colour diagram of the source during these observations are found to be different from any reported so far. The duration of these dips is found to be of the order of a few tens of seconds with a repetition time of a few hundred seconds. The transition between these dips and non-dips which differ in intensity by a factor of $\sim 3.5$, is observed to be very fast ($\sim$ a few seconds). It is observed that the low-frequency narrow QPOs are absent in the power density spectrum (PDS) of the dip and non-dip regions of class $\omega$ and the PDS is a power law in the 0.1 – 10 Hz frequency range. There is a remarkable similarity in the spectral and timing properties of the source during the dip and non-dip regions in this set of observations. These properties of the source are distinctly different from those seen in the observations of other classes. This indicates that the basic accretion disk structure during both dip and non-dip regions of class $\omega$ is similar, but differ only in intensity. To explain these observations, we invoke a model in which the viscosity is very close to critical viscosity and the shock wave is weak or absent.</p>

				<title>On the Relativistic Beaming and Orientation Effects in Core-Dominated Quasars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0235-0242</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we investigate the relativistic beaming effects in a well-defined sample of core-dominated quasars using the correlation between the relative prominence of the core with respect to the extended emission (defined as the ratio of core- to lobe- flux density measured in the rest frame of the source) and the projected linear size as an indicator of relativistic beaming and source orientation. Based on the orientation-dependent relativistic beaming and unification paradigm for high luminosity sources in which the Fanaroff-Riley class-II radio galaxies form the unbeamed parent population of both the lobe- and core-dominated quasars which are expected to lie at successively smaller angles to the line of sight, we find that the flows in the cores of these core-dominated quasars are highly relativistic, with optimum bulk Lorentz factor, $\gamma_{opt}\sim 6$&#8212;16, and also highly anisotropic, with an average viewing angle, $\sim 9^{\circ}-16^{\circ}$. Furthermore, the largest boosting occurs within a critical cone angle of $\approx 4^{\circ}-10^{\circ}$.</p>

				<title>Spectral Variability in Hard X-rays and the Evidence for a 13.5 Years Period in the Bright Quasar 3C273</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0243-0258</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the observation of nearest quasar 3C273 made with LASE instrument on November 20th, 1998 as a part of our continuing programme of balloon borne hard X-ray observations in the 20–200 keV band using high sensitivity Large Area Scintillation counter Experiment. Our data clearly show a steep spectrum in the 20–200 keV with power law spectral index $\alpha = 226\pm 0.07$. This is in complete contrast to the reported data from OSSE and BeppoSAX which suggest the value of 1.3 to 1.6 for the power law index in the X-ray energy band, but is quite consistent with the value derived for the high energy gamma ray data. A single power law fit in the X-ray and gamma ray energy bands points to a common origin of these photons and the absence of spectral break around 1 MeV as suggested in literature. We have reanalyzed the available data to study the temporal variability of the spectrum in the hard X-ray band. Our analysis reveals that 50 keV flux from the source, shows a strong modulation with a period of about 13.5 years. The analysis of the optical light curve of the source also supports the 5000 day period.We discuss the emission mechanism and the possible sites for X-ray photons along with the implications of the long term periodicity with respect to source geometry.</p>

				<title>The Hubble Relation for a Comprehensive Sample of QSOs</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0011-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A correlation between redshifts $(z)$ and apparent magnitudes $(V)$ (Hubble relation) of Quasi Stellar Objects (QSOs) has long been sought. Such a correlation exists for galaxies whose redshifts are of cosmological origin. However, a plot of the two quantities representing the Hubble diagram for QSOs exhibits, in general, a wild scatter. This raises the question whether redshifts of QSOs are cosmological. On the other hand, most luminous QSOs in groups, and subsamples with particular properties, have been reported to show the Hubble relation. In the present paper, we analyse all optically non-variable QSOs in a comprehensive sample. In our analysis we grouped the objects into certain intervals of apparent magnitudes. Correlations obtained between redshifts and magnitudes are all statistically robust. Also, the Hubble relation in the usual form $V=5\log z+C$ is obeyed very convincingly for QSOs with $V\lt 19.5$.</p>

				<title>HI Fluctuations at Large Redshifts: II – the Signal Expected for the GMRT</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0023-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For the GMRT, we calculate the expected signal from redshifted HI emission at two frequency bands centered at 610 and 325MHz. The study focuses on the visibility-visibility cross-correlations, proposed earlier as the optimal statistical estimator for detecting and analyzing this signal. These correlations directly probe the power spectrum of density fluctuations at the redshift where the radiation originated, and thereby provide a method for studying the large scale structures at large redshifts. We present detailed estimates of the correlations expected between the visibilities measured at different baselines and frequencies. Analytic fitting formulas representing the salient features of the expected signal are also provided. These will be useful in planning observations and deciding an optimal strategy for detecting this signal.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0043</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the GMRT detection of associated HI 21 cm-line absorption in the $z = 1.1946$ red quasar 3C 190. Most of the absorption is blue-shifted with respect to the systemic redshift. The absorption, at $\sim 647.7$MHz, is broad and complex, spanning a velocity width of $\sim 600$ kms$^{-1}$. Since the core is self-absorbed at this frequency, the absorption is most likely towards the hotspots. Comparison of the radio and deep optical images reveal linear filaments in the optical which overlap with the brighter radio jet towards the south-west.We therefore suggest that most of the HI 21 cm-line absorption could be occurring in the atomic gas shocked by the south-west jet.</p>

				<title>Large Scale Magnetic Fields: Density Power Spectrum in Redshift Space</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0051-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We compute the density redshift-space power spectrum in the presence of tangled magnetic fields and compare it with existing observations. Our analysis shows that if these magnetic fields originated in the early universe then it is possible to construct models for which the shape of the power spectrum agrees with the large scale slope of the observed power spectrum. However requiring compatibility with observed CMBR anisotropies, the normalization of the power spectrum is too low for magnetic fields to have significant impact on the large scale structure at present. Magnetic fields of a more recent origin generically give density power spectrum $\propto k^{4}$ which doesn’t agree with the shape of the observed power spectrum at any scale. Magnetic fields generate curl modes of the velocity field which increase both the quadrupole and hexadecapole of the redshift space power spectrum. For curl modes, the hexadecapole dominates over quadrupole. So the presence of curl modes could be indicated by an anomalously large hexadecapole, which has not yet been computed from observation.</p>
					<p>It appears difficult to construct models in which tangled magnetic fields could have played a major role in shaping the large scale structure in the present epoch. However if they did, one of the best ways to infer their presence would be from the redshift space effects in the density power spectrum.</p>

				<title>Studies of Clump Structure of Photodissociation Regions at Millimeter and Sub-millimeterWavelengths</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0069-0083</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To interpret the millimeter and sub-millimeter line emissions of atomic and molecular species from galactic and extragalactic photodissociation regions, warm gas components and molecular clouds, generally, escape probability formalism of Tielens &amp; Hollenbach (herein referred as TH) are employed which is based on the assumption of plane parallel geometry of infinite slab allowing photons to escape only from the front. Contrary to the assumption observationally it is found that these lines are optically thin except OI(63$\mu$m) and low rotational transitions of CO and some other molecules. This observational evidence led us to assume that emitting regions are finite parallel plane slab in which photons are allowed to escape from both the surfaces (back and front). Therefore, in the present study escape of radiations from both sides of the homogeneous and also clumpy PDR/molecular clouds are taken into consideration for calculating the line intensities at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths (hereinafter referred as QA). Results are compared with that of the TH model. It is found that thermal and chemical structures of the regions are almost similar in both the formalisms. But line intensities are modified by differing factors. Particularly at lowdensity and lowkinetic temperature and also for optically thin lines line intensities calculated from TH and QA model differ substantially. But at density higher than the critical density and also for optically thick lines TH and QA models converge to almost same values. An attempt has been made to study the physical conditions of the M17 region employing the present formalism.</p>

					<p>We obtain the $x - p_{x}$ Poincare phase plane for a two dimensional, resonant, galactic type Hamiltonian using conventional numerical integration, a second order symplectic integrator and a map based on the averaged Hamiltonian. It is found that all three methods give good results, for small values of the perturbation parameter, while the symplectic integrator does a better job than the mapping, for large perturbations. The dynamical spectra are used to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion.</p>

				<page>0099-0109</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A research that we conducted in 1963 on the evolution of the binaries based on the available orbital data to obtain a philosophical degree, led to the establishment of an interesting and new diagram between the logarithm of the total mass and a particular parameter $X$, bound to the areal constant. This appeared to have a real physical significance but the basic observational material was insufficiently extended to assure its undeniable existence. In 1981, a new research based on a more extended orbital material, has confirmed this diagram. Presently, another important increase in the orbital material and the availability of highly accurate trigonometric parallaxes produced by the Hipparcos satellite, gave us the opportunity to confirm once more the stability of this diagram. This last research is here described.</p>

				<title>Optical Variability Properties of High Luminosity AGN Classes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results of a comparative study of the intra-night optical variability (INOV) characteristics of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, which involves a systematic intra-night optical monitoring of seven sets of high luminosity AGNs covering the redshift range $z\simeq 0.2$ to $z\simeq 2.2$. The sample, matched in the optical luminosity – redshift $(M_{B}-z)$ plane, consists of seven radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), eight radio lobe-dominated quasars (LDQs), five radio core-dominated quasars (CDQs) and six BL Lac objects (BLs). Systematic CCD observations, aided by a careful data analysis procedure, have allowed us to detect INOV with amplitudes as low as about 1\%\. Present observations cover a total of 113 nights (720 hours) with only a single qusar monitored as continuously as possible on a given night. Considering the cases of only unambiguous detections of INOV we have estimated duty cycles (DCs) of 17\%, 12\%, 20\%\ and 61\%\ for RQQs, LDQs, CDQs, and BLs, respectively. The much lower amplitude and DC of INOV shown by RQQs compared to BLs may be understood in terms of their having optical synchrotron jets which are modestly misdirected from us. From our fairly extensive dataset, no general trend of a correlation between the INOVamplitude and the apparent optical brightness of the quasar is noticed. This suggests that the physical mechanisms of INOV and long term optical variability (LTOV) do not have a one-to-one relationship and different factors are involved. Also, the absence of a clear negative correlation between the INOV and LTOV characteristics of blazars of our sample points toward an inconspicuous contribution of accretion disk fluctuations to the observed INOV. The INOV duty cycle of the AGNs observed in this program suggests that INOV is associated predominantly with the highly polarized optical emission components. We also report new VLA imaging of two RQQs (1029 + 329 &amp; 1252 + 020) in our sample which has yielded a 5 GHz detection in one of them (1252 + 020; $S_{5\text{\,GHz}}\simeq 1$ mJy)</p>

A weak broad absorption feature reported by de Bruyn (1996) has not been detected in our observations. We also place an upper limit of 4 mJy $(2\sigma)$ on emission line strength at the position where Uson <i>et al.</i> (1991) claimed to have found a narrow emission line.</p>

				<title>HI Fluctuations at Large Redshifts: III – Simulating the Signal Expected at GMRT</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0067-0080</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We simulate the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) at the redshifts $z = 1.3$ and 3.4 using a cosmological N-body simulation along with a prescription for assigning HI masses to the particles. The HI is distributed in clouds whose properties are consistent with those of the damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption systems (DLAs) seen in quasar spectra. The clustering properties of these clouds are identical to those of the dark matter. We use this to simulate the redshifted HI emission expected at 610 MHz and 325 MHz, two of the observing bands at the GMRT. These are used to predict the correlations expected between the complex visibilities measured at different baselines and frequencies in radio-interferometric observations with the GMRT. The visibility correlations directly probe the power spectrum of HI fluctuations at the epoch when the HI emission originated, and this holds the possibility of using HI observations to study large-scale structures at high $z$.</p>

				<title>Angular Momentum Transport in Quasi-Keplerian Accretion Disks</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0081-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We reexamine arguments advanced by Hayashi &amp; Matsuda (2001), who claim that several simple, physically motivated derivations based on mean free path theory for calculating the viscous torque in a quasi-Keplerian accretion disk yield results that are inconsistent with the generally accepted model. If correct, the ideas proposed by Hayashi &amp; Matsuda would radically alter our understanding of the nature of the angular momentum transport in the disk, which is a central feature of accretion disk theory. However, in this paper we point out several fallacies in their arguments and show that there indeed exists a simple derivation based on mean free path theory that yields an expression for the viscous torque that is proportional to the radial derivative of the angular velocity in the accretion disk, as expected. The derivation is based on the analysis of the epicyclic motion of gas parcels in adjacent eddies in the disk.</p>

					<p>Radial dipole matrix elements having astrophysical importance have been computed for highly excited states of hydrogen atom. Computation is based on Heisenberg’s form of correspondence principle for Coulomb potential. Particular attention has been paid to the choice of classical analogue $(n_{c})$ of principal quantum number $(n)$. The computed radial matrix elements are in good agreement with quantum mechanical results. Further, radial matrix elements for few transitions involving high $n$ neighboring states of hydrogen atom are presented.</p>

					<p>We describe the two-dimensional TreePM method in this paper. The 2d TreePM code is an accurate and efficient technique to carry out large two-dimensional N-body simulations in cosmology. This hybrid code combines the 2d Barnes and Hut Tree method and the 2d Particle–Mesh method. We describe the splitting of force between the PM and the Tree parts. We also estimate error in force for a realistic configuration. Finally, we discuss some tests of the code.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>$\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$-drifting jets have been generally ignored for the past 25 years even though they may well describe all the astrophysical jet sources, both on galactic and stellar scales. Here we present closed-form solutions for their joint field-and-particle distribution, argue that the observed jets are near equipartition, with extremely relativistic, monoenergetic $e^{\pm}$-pairs of bulk Lorentz factor $\gamma  \lesssim 10^{4}$, and are first-order stable. We describe plausible mechanisms for the jets’ (i) formation, (ii) propagation, and (iii) termination. Wherever a beam meets with resistance, its frozen-in Poynting flux transforms the delta-shaped energy distribution of the pairs into an almost white power law, $E^{2}N_{E}\sim E^{-\epsilon}$ with $\epsilon\gtrsim 0$, via single-step falls through the huge convected potential.</p>

				<title>On the Origin of the Wide HI Absorption Line towards Sgr A$^{\ast}$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0129-0141</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have imaged a region of $\sim 5'$ extent surrounding Sgr A$^{\ast}$ in the HI 21 cm-line absorption using the Very Large Array. A Gaussian decomposition of the optical depth spectra at positions within $\sim 2'$ ($\sim 5$ pc at 8.5 kpc) of Sgr A$^{\ast}$ detects a wide line underlying the many narrow absorption lines. The wide line has a mean peak optical depth of 0.32 $\pm$ 0.12 centered at a mean velocity of $V_{\text{lsr}} = -4\pm 15$ km s$^{-1}$. The mean full width at half maximum is 119$\pm$42 km s$^{-1}$. Such a wide line is absent in the spectra at positions beyond $\sim 2'$ from Sgr A$^{\ast}$. The position-velocity diagrams in optical depth reveal that the wide line originates in various components of the circumnuclear disk (radius $\sim 1.3'$) surrounding Sgr A$^{\ast}$. These components contribute to the optical depth of the wide line in different velocity ranges. The position-velocity diagrams do not reveal any diffuse feature which could be attributed to a large number of HI clouds along the line of sight to Sgr A$^{\ast}$. Consequently, the wide line has no implications either to a global population of shocked HI clouds in the Galaxy or to the energetics of the interstellar medium as was earlier thought.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have used the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to measure the Galactic HI 21-cm line absorption towards 102 extragalactic radio continuum sources, located at high $(|b| \gt 15^{\circ})$ Galactic latitudes. The Declination coverage of the present survey is $\delta \grtsim -45^{\circ}$. With a mean rms optical depth of $\sim 0.003$, this is the most sensitive Galactic HI 21-cm line absorption survey to date. To supplement the absorption data, we have extracted the HI 21-cm line emission profiles towards these 102 lines of sight from the Leiden Dwingeloo Survey of Galactic neutral hydrogen. We have carried out a Gaussian fitting analysis to identify the discrete absorption and emission components in these profiles. In this paper, we present the spectra and the components. A subsequent paper will discuss the interpretation of these results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have carried out a sensitive high-latitude $(|b| \gt 15^{\circ})$ HI 21 cm-line absorption survey towards 102 sources using the GMRT. With a $3\sigma$ detection limit in optical depth of $\sim 0.01$, this is the most sensitive HI absorption survey. We detected 126 absorption features most of which also have corresponding HI emission features in the Leiden Dwingeloo Survey of Galactic neutral Hydrogen. The histogram of random velocities of the absorption features is well-fit by two Gaussians centered at $V_{\text{lsr}} \sim 0$ km s$^{−1}$ with velocity dispersions of $7.6 \pm 0.3$ km s$^{-1}$ and $21\pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$ respectively. About 20\%\ of the HI absorption features form the larger velocity dispersion component. The HI absorption features forming the narrow Gaussian have a mean optical depth of $0.20\pm 0.19$, a mean HI column density of $(1.46 \pm 1.03) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a mean spin temperature of $121\pm 69$ K. These HI concentrations can be identified with the standard HI clouds in the cold neutral medium of the Galaxy. The HI absorption features forming the wider Gaussian have a mean optical depth of $0.04\pm 0.02$, a mean HI column density of $(4.3\pm 3.4)\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a mean spin temperature of $125\pm 82$ K. The HI column densities of these fast clouds decrease with their increasing random velocities. These fast clouds can be identified with a population of clouds detected so far only in optical absorption and in HI emission lines with a similar velocity dispersion. This population of fast clouds is likely to be in the lower Galactic Halo.</p>

				<title>An Apparent Descriptive Method for Judging the Synchronization of Rotation of Binary Stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0203-0211</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of the synchronous rotation of binary stars is judged by using a synchronous parameter $Q$ introduced in an apparent descriptive method. The synchronous parameter $Q$ is defined as the ratio of the rotational period to the orbital period. The author suggests several apparent phenomenal descriptive methods for judging the synchronization of rotation of binary stars. The first method is applicable when the orbital inclination is well-known. The synchronous parameter is defined by using the orbital inclination $i$ and the observable rotational velocity $(V_{1,2} \sin i)_{M}$. The method is mainly suitable for eclipsing binary stars. Several others are suggested for the cases when the orbital inclination $i$ is unknown. The synchronous parameters are defined by using $a_{1,2} \sin i$, $m_{1,2} \sin^{3} i$, the mass function $f(m)$ and semi-amplitudes of the velocity curve, $K_{1,2}$ given in catalogue of parameters of spectroscopic binary systems and $(V_{1,2}\sin i)_{M}$. These methods are suitable for spectroscopic binary stars including those that show eclipses and visual binary stars concurrently. The synchronous parameters for fifty-five components in thirty binary systems are calculated by using several methods. The numerical results are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The statistical results are listed in Table 3. In addition, several apparent descriptive methods are discussed.</p>

				<title>GMRT HI Observations of the Eridanus Group of Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The GMRT HI 21cm-line observations of galaxies in the Eridanus group are presented. The Eridanus group, at a distance of $\sim 23$ Mpc, is a loose group of $\sim 200$ galaxies. The group extends to more than 10 Mpc in projection. The velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the group is $\sim 240$ km s$^{-1}$. The galaxies are clustered into different sub-groups. The overall population mix of the group is 30\%\ (E + S0) and 70\%\ (Sp + Irr). The observations of 57 Eridanus galaxies were carried out with the GMRT for $\sim 200$ h. HI emission was detected from 31 galaxies. The channel rms of $\sim 1$ mJy beam$^{-1}$ was achieved for most of the image-cubes made with 4 h of data. The corresponding HI column density sensitivity $(3\sigma)$ is $\sim 1\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ for a velocity-width of $\sim 13.4$ km s$^{-1}$. The $3\sigma$ detection limit of HI mass is $\sim 1.2\times 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ for a line-width of 50 km s$^{-1}$. Total HI images, HI velocity fields, global HI line profiles, HI mass surface densities, HI disk parameters and HI rotation curves are presented. The velocity fields are analysed separately for the approaching and the receding sides of the galaxies. These data will be used to study the HI and the radio continuum properties, the Tully–Fisher relations, the dark matter halos, and the kinematical and HI lopsidedness in galaxies.</p>

				<title>The HI Content of the Eridanus Group of Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0071-0087</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The HI content of galaxies in the Eridanus group is studied using the GMRT observations and the HIPASS data. A significant HI deficiency up to a factor of 2–3 is observed in galaxies in the high galaxy density regions. The HI deficiency in galaxies is observed to be directly correlated to the local projected galaxy density, and inversely correlated to the line-of-sight radial velocity. Furthermore, galaxies with larger optical diameters are predominantly in the lower galaxy density regions. It is suggested that the HI deficiency in Eridanus is due to tidal interactions. In some galaxies, evidences of tidal interactions are seen. An important implication is that significant evolution of galaxies can take place in the group environment. In the hierarchical way of formation of clusters via mergers of groups, a fraction of the observed HI deficiency in clusters could have originated in groups. The co-existence of S0s and severely HI deficient galaxies in the Eridanus group suggests that tidal interaction is likely to be an effective mechanism for transforming spirals to S0s.</p>

				<title>Radio Continuum and Far-infrared Emission from the Galaxies in the Eridanus Group</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0089-0102</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Eridanus galaxies follow the well-known radio–FIR correlation. The majority (70\%) of these galaxies have their star formation rates below that of the Milky Way. The galaxies that have a significant excess of radio emission are identified as low luminosity AGNs based on their radio morphologies obtained from the GMRT observations. There are no powerful AGNs ($L_{20 \text{\,cm}}\gt 10^{23}$W Hz$^{-1}$) in the group. The two most far-infrared and radio luminous galaxies in the group have optical and HI morphologies suggestive of recent tidal interactions. The Eridanus group also has two far-infrared luminous but radio-deficient galaxies. It is believed that these galaxies are observed within a few Myr of the onset of an intense star formation episode after being quiescent for at least a 100 Myr. The upper end of the radio luminosity distribution of the Eridanus galaxies ($L_{20 \text{\,cm}}\sim 10^{22}$W Hz$^{-1}$) is consistent with that of the field galaxies, other groups, and late-type galaxies in nearby clusters.</p>

				<title>Parametric Identification of Solar Series based on an Adaptive Parallel Methodology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0103-0115</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work we present an adaptive parallel methodology to optimize the identification of time series through parametric models, applying it to the case of sunspot series. We employ high precision computation of system identification algorithms, and use recursive least squares processing and ARMAX (Autoregressive Moving Average Extensive) parametric modelling. This methodology could be very useful when the high precision mathematical modelling of dynamic complex systems is required. After explaining the proposed heuristics and the tuning of its parameters, we showthe results we have found for several solar series using different implementations. Thus, we demonstrate how the result precision improves.</p>

				<title>Asteroseismology: Past, Present and Future</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0123-0138</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Asteroseismology studies stars with a wide variety of interior and surface conditions. For two decades asteroseismic techniques have been applied to many pulsating stars across the HR diagram. Asteroseismology is now a booming field of research with stunning new discoveries; I highlight a personal selection of these in this review, many of which are discussed in more detail elsewhere in these proceedings. For many years the Nainital–Cape Survey for northern roAp stars has been running at ARIES, so I emphasise new spectroscopic results for roAp stars and point out the outstanding prospects for the planned ARIES 3-m telescope at Devastal. High precision spectroscopy has revolutionised the asteroseismic study of some types of stars – particularly solar-like oscillators and roAp stars – while photometry is still the best way to study the frequency spectra that are the basic data of asteroseismology. New telescopes, new photometers and space missions are revolutionising asteroseismic photometry. In addition to the ground-based potential of asteroseismic spectroscopy, India has the knowledge and capability for space-based asteroseismic photometry. The future for asteroseismology is bright indeed, especially for Indian astronomers.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The sun being the nearest star, seismic observations with high spatial resolution are possible, thus providing accurate measurement of frequencies of about half million modes of solar oscillations covering a wide range of degree. With these data helioseismology has enabled us to study the solar interior in sufficient detail to infer the large-scale structure and rotation of the solar interior. With the availability of high quality helioseismic data over a good fraction of a solar cycle it is also possible to study temporal variations in solar structure and dynamics. Some of these problems and recent results will be discussed.</p>

				<page>0171-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The amplitude of solar-like oscillations results from a balance between excitation and damping. As in the sun, the excitation is attributed to turbulent motions that stochastically excite the $p$ modes in the uppermost part of the convective zone. We present here a model for the excitation mechanism. Comparisons between modeled amplitudes and helio and stellar seismic constraints are presented and the discrepancies discussed. Finally the possibility and the interest of detecting such stochastically excited modes in pre-main sequence stars are also discussed.</p>

				<title>HD 101065, the Most Peculiar Star: First Results from Precise Radial Velocity Study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0185-0191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we discuss the prospects for asteroseismology with spatial resolution and motivate studies of the most chemically peculiar roAp star HD 101065. We present the first results from a high-precision radial velocity (RV) study of HD 101065 based on data spanning four nights that were acquired using the HARPS echelle-spectrometer at the ESO 3.6 m telescope. The analysis of individual nights showed the amplitude and phase modulation of the dominant mode. The analysis of the whole data set showed the presence of multi-periodic oscillations with two groups of equally-spaced modes. We find $\Delta v = 65.2 \mu$Hz and $\delta v = 7.3\mu$Hz for the large and the small spacing, respectively. HD 101065 is the only roAp star to show the existence of two groups of $l = 0$, 2 and $l = 1$, 3 excited modes.</p>

					<p>Nainital;Cape Survey was started with an aim to search for new rapidly oscillating Ap stars in the northern hemisphere.We discovered one new mono-periodic roAp star HD 12098. The frequency separation of HD 12098 suggests a rotation period of 5.5 days for the star. We summarize here the observations of HD 12098 and briefly discuss the results of the multi-site observation campaign organized to resolve the ambiguity in the determination of the rotation period of HD 12098. Other interesting results like non-oscillating Ap stars discovered and two candidate stars in which roAp periodicity is seen but not confirmed are also discussed.</p>

				<title>Using the Seismology of Non-magnetic Chemically Peculiar Stars as a Probe of Dynamical Processes in Stellar Interiors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0231-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chemical composition is a good tracer of the hydrodynamical processes that occur in stars as they often lead to mixing and particle transport. By comparing abundances predicted by models and those observed in stars we can infer some constraints on those mixing processes. As pulsations in the stars are often very sensitive to chemical composition, we can use asteroseismology to probe the internal chemical composition of stars where no direct observations are possible. In this paper I focus on main sequence stars Am, $\gamma$ Bootis, and HgMn stars and discuss what we can learn of mixing processes in these stars from seismology.</p>

					<p>We give an overview of past and present efforts to make seismology of $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus stars possible. Previous work has not led to the observational detection and identification of a sufficient number of pulsation modes for these pulsators for the construction of unique seismic models. However, recent efforts including large ground-based observational campaigns, work on pre-main sequence pulsators, asteroseismic satellite missions, theoretical advances on mode identification methods, and the discovery of a star showing simultaneous self-excited $\delta$ Scuti and $\gama$ Doradus oscillations suggest that we may be able to explore the interiors of these pulsators in the very near future.</p>

				<page>0261-0271</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Subdwarf B stars play a significant role in close binary evolution and in the hot star content of old stellar populations, in particular in giant elliptical galaxies. While the question of their origin poses several problems for stellar evolution theory, one of their most fascinating properties is the presence of multi-periodic 2–3 minute oscillations. Interpreting these oscillations optimally requires the correct identification of the modes. Partial identifications can be obtained using high-speed observations of radial velocity and colour variations. We review some of the several attempts to make such observations, most recently with the Multi-Site Spectroscopic Telescope campaign and with ULTRACAM.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The interpretation of pulsation data for sun-like stars is currently facing challenges quite similar to those faced by white dwarf modelers ten years ago. The observational requirements for uninterrupted long-term monitoring are beginning to be satisfied by successful multi-site campaigns and dedicated satellite missions. But exploration of the most important physical parameters in theoretical models has been fairly limited, making it difficult to establish a detailed best-fit model for a particular set of oscillation frequencies. I review the past development and the current state of white dwarf asteroseismology, with an emphasis on what this can tell us about the road to success for asteroseismology of other types of stars.</p>

The main pitfalls and ambiguities occurring in Fourier analysis are summarized and illustrated. Someclassical, Least Squares (LS) based methods for spectrum analysis are analyzed and commented on from the point of view of ill-posed problems. The insight that can be gained from such analyses is discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Preliminary results on observations of open clusters are presented. The project has been initiated in the framework of the Uzbek–Taiwan and Taiwan–Baltic collaboration, mainly to upgrade and make use of facilities at Maidanak Observatory. We present detailed, multiwavelength studies of the young cluster NGC 6823 and the associated complex nebulosity, to diagnose the young stellar population and star formation history in the region. In addition, 7 compact open clusters have been monitored for stellar variability. We show how observations like these could feasibly be used to look for exoplanet transit events. We also expect to join the Whole-Earth Telescope effort in future campaigns for asteroseismology.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian team at ISRO has been part of the Whole Earth Telescope (WET) team since 1988 when we first participated in the campaign on V471 Tau.We have been part of many other observing campaigns over the last decade. This presentation traces the circumstances leading to our joining the WET team and how useful the coverage from the Indian longitude has been. The results of several pulsators from the WET runs during which we participated are also described. These include PG1159-035 the prototype of the GW Vir type of stars, RE J 0751+14 a cataclysmic variable, PG 1336-018 a binary with an sdB pulsator and finally HR 1217 a roAp star. The paper concludes with what the limitations are in our observations and how we can overcome them in the future.</p>

					<p>The Maidanak One-meter Telescope (MOT) is a Ritchey-Chretien telescope by Carl Zeiss, located atop Maidanak in Uzbekistan, where site parameters indicate excellent atmospheric seeing conditions. An effort to computerize the MOT, jointly made by an Uzbek, Taiwanese and Baltic consortium, is expected to complete in 2005. Monitoring the variability of star clusters will be among the first scientific projects to be carried out. Equipped with sensitive CCD cameras, the MOT, with its middle-Asia geographic location, will be a desirable addition to the Whole Earth Telescope (WET) network.We describe the upgrade engineering and instrumentation of the telescope and how the system can be used in future campaigns.</p>

				<title>Argos: An Optimized Time-Series Photometer</title>

				<page>0321-0330</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We designed a prime focus CCD photometer, Argos, optimized for high speed time-series measurements of blue variables (Nather &amp; Mukadam 2004) for the 2.1 m telescope at McDonald Observatory. Lack of any intervening optics between the primary mirror and the CCD makes the instrument highly efficient.We measure an improvement in sensitivity by a factor of nine over the 3-channel PMT photometers used on the same telescope and for the same exposure time. The CCD frame transfer operation triggered by GPS synchronized pulses serves as an electronic shutter for the photometer. This minimizes the dead time between exposures, but more importantly, allows a precise control of the start and duration of the exposure. We expect the uncertainty in our timing to be less than 100 $\mu$s.</p>

				<title>Facilities at ARIES for the Nainital–Cape Survey</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0339-0347</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A collaborative programme searching for mmag pulsations in chemically peculiar stars in the northern hemisphere was initiated in 1997 between Nainital, India, and Cape Town, South Africa. It was therefore named as the \textbf{Nainital–Cape Survey} programme. The detection limits imposed by the observing conditions (including atmospheric noise and telescope size) at both Manora Peak and Devasthal sites are described. The scintillation noise on the best photometric nights is $\approx 0.1$ to 0.2 mmag for these sites. Both places allow one to detect few mmag variation in bright stars ($B \leq 12$ mag), and are therefore particularly well-suited for carrying out the proposed surveywork. The main characteristics of the three-channel photometer developed at ARIES for carrying out the observations are also presented. This excellent instrument has been used extensively since 1999 at the f/13 Cassegrain focus of ARIES’ 104 cm telescope. In particular, it allowed the survey to result in the discovery of $\delta$ Scuti like pulsations in four Am stars, in one rapidly oscillating Ap star, and in a number of probable variables so far. The future prospects are then presented, which regard the acquisition of a high speed time series CCD photometer, a project to build a 3-metre class telescope at Devasthal, and collaborative observations with Indian and foreign astronomical sites.</p>

				<title>Unravelling the Nature of HD 81032 – A New RS CVn Binary</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0359-0376</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>BVR photometric and quasi-simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations of the star HD 81032 have been carried out during the years 2000–2004. A photometric period of 18.802 $\pm$ 0.07d has been detected for this star. A large group of spots with a migration period of 7.43 $\pm$ 0.07 years is inferred from the first three years of the data. H$\alpha$ and CaII H and K emissions from the star indicate high chromospheric activity. The available photometry in the BVRIJHK bands is consistent with the spectral type of K0IV previously found for this star.We have also examined the spectral energy distribution of HD 81032 for the presence of an infrared colour excess using the 2MASS JHK and IRAS photometry, but found no significant excess in any band above the normal values expected for a star with this spectral type. We have also analyzed the X-ray emission properties of this star using data obtained by the ROSAT X-ray observatory during its All-Sky Survey phase. An X-ray flare of about 12 hours duration was detected during the two days of X-ray coverage obtained for this star. Its X-ray spectrum, while only containing 345 counts, is inconsistent with a single-temperature component solar-abundance coronal plasma model, but implies either the presence of two or more plasma components, non-solar abundances, or a combination of both of these properties. All of the above properties of HD 81032 suggest that it is a newly identified, evolved RS CVn binary.</p>

					<p>This paper presents an analysis of a series of spectra in the Red Rectangle nebula. Only the reddest part of the spectra can safely be attributed to light from the nebula, and indicates Rayleigh scattering by the gas, in conformity with the large angles of scattering involved and the proximity of the star. In the blue, light from HD 44179, refracted or scattered in the atmosphere, dominates the spectra. This paper questions the reliability of ground-based broad-band spectra of extended objects in the blue.</p>

				<title>Average Anisotropy Characteristics of High Energy Cosmic Ray Particles and Geomagnetic Disturbance Index Ap</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0429-0434</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The average characteristics of the diurnal and semi-diurnal anisotropy of cosmic ray intensity at relativistic energies have been obtained by using data from the worldwide grid of neutron monitor for the period 1989 to 1996. The complex behaviour of the diurnal amplitudes and time of maxima (phase) and its association with the Ap index on a long-term and day-to-day basis have been studied. Even though the general characteristics, on a yearly average basis, have not changed significantly during this period, both the diurnal and semi-diurnal amplitudes and phases vary significantly, besides significant changes being observed for different interplanetary conditions on a short-term basis. It is found that the relationship between the Ap index and the diurnal vector is out of phase during the period 1991 to 1995. On a long-term basis, the correlation of diurnal variation with Ap index has been found to vary during the solar cycle. On a short-term basis, it has been observed that the high Ap days are usually associated with higher amplitudes with phase shifted to earlier hours.</p>

				<title>Small-scale Magnetic Field Diagnostics outside Sunspots: Comparison of Different Methods</title>

				<page>0435-0445</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyse different observational data related to the problem of intrinsic magnetic field strength in small-scale fluxtubes outside sunspots. We conclude that the kG range of fluxtube fields follows from not only classical line ratio method, but also from other old and new techniques. For the quiet regions on the Sun, the most probable mode of such fields has a magnetic field strength of 1.2–1.5 kG assuming the rectangular field profile. To best interpret the observations, a weak background field between fluxtubes should be assumed, and its magnetic field strength is expected to increase with the filling factor of fluxtubes. The alternative point of view about subkilogauss fluxtube fields is critically examined, and possible sources of different conclusions are presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reviving a calculation made by Eddington in the 1920s, and using the most recent and comprehensive databases available on stars and galaxies, including more than 2,500,000 stars and around 20,000 galaxies we have computed their total radiation received at the Earth just outside its atmosphere. This radiation density, if thermalized, would be equivalent to a temperature of 4.212 K. The comparability of this temperature to that of the cosmic microwave background (2.723 K) may either be a pure coincidence or may hold a key to some as yet unknown, aspect of the universe.</p>

				<title>The Tully–Fisher Relations of the Eridanus Group of Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0007-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Tully–Fisher (TF) or the luminosity–linewidth relations of the galaxies in the Eridanus group are constructed using the HI rotation curves and the luminosities in the optical and in the near-infrared bands. The slopes of the TF relations (absolute magnitude $vs$ $\log 2V_{\text{flat}}$) are $-8.6 \pm 1.1$, $-10.0\pm 1.5$, $-10.7 \pm 2.1$, and $-9.7 \pm 1.3$ in the R, J, H, and K bands respectively for galaxies having flat HI rotation curves. These values of the slopes are consistent with those obtained from studies of other groups and clusters. The scatter in the TF relations is in the range 0.5–1.1 mag in different bands. This scatter is considerably larger compared to those observed in other groups and clusters. It is suggested that the larger scatter in the TF relations for the Eridanus group is related to the loose structure of the group. If the TF relations are constructed using the baryonic mass (stellar + HI + Helium mass) instead of the stellar luminosity, nearly identical slopes are obtained in the R and in the near-infrared bands. The baryonic TF (baryonic mass $vs$ $\log 2V_{\text{flat}}$) slope is in the range 3.5–4.1.</p>

				<title>Variable Quasi Periodic Oscillations during an Outburst of the Transient X-ray Pulsar XTE J1858 + 034</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0025-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated the Quasi Periodic Oscillation (QPO) properties of the transient accreting X-ray pulsar XTE J1858 + 034 during the second outburst of this source in April–May 2004. We have used observations made with the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) during May 14–18, 2004, in the declining phase of the outburst. We detected the presence of low frequency QPOs in the frequency range of 140–185 mHz in all the RXTE-PCA observations. We report evolution of the QPO parameters with the time, X-ray flux, and X-ray photon energy. Though a correlation between the QPO centroid frequency and the instantaneous X-ray flux is not very clear from the data, we point out that the QPO frequency and the one day averaged X-ray flux decreased with time during these observations. We have obtained a clear energy dependence of the RMS variation in the QPOs, increasing from about 3\%\ at 3 keV to 6\%\ at 25 keV. The X-ray pulse profile is a single peaked sinusoidal, with pulse fraction increasing from 20\%\ at 3 keV to 45\%\ at 30 keV. We found that, similar to the previous outburst, the energy spectrum is well fitted with amodel consisting of a cut-off power law along with an iron emission line.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Here we report the spectral characteristics of the high and low states of the pulsar 4U 0114+65 and examine the change in the parameters of the spectral model. A power lawand a photoelectric absorption by material along the line of sight together with a high energy cut-off suffice to describe the continuum spectrum in both the states. A fluorescence iron line at $\sim 6.4$ keV is present in the high as well as in the low state, though it is less intense in the latter. The photon index, cut-off energy and e-folding energy values hardly show any discernible change over the states. We compare these spectral characteristics as observed with ASCA with those of other satellites. We also compare the spectral characteristics of 4U 0114 + 650 with other X-ray sources which show intensity variation at different time scales.</p>

				<title>Photometric Modelling of Close Binary Star CN And</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0047-0056</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The results of two color photometry of active close binary CN And are presented and analyzed. The light curves of the system are obviously asymmetric, with the primary maximum brighter than the secondary maximum, which is known as the O’Conell effect. The most plausible explanation of the asymmetry is expected to be due to spot activity of the primary component. For the determination of physical and geometrical parameters, the most new version of W–D code was used, but the presence of asymmetry prevented the convergence of the method when the whole light curves were used. The solutions were obtained by applying mode 3 of W–D code to the first half of the light curves, assuming synchronous rotation and zero eccentricity. Absolute parameters of the system were obtained from combining the photometric solution with spectroscopic data obtained from radial velocity curve analysis. The results indicate the poor thermal contact of the components and transit primary minimum. Finally the O–C diagram was analyzed. It was found that the orbital period of the system is changing with a rate of $dP/dt = -2.2(6) \times 10^{-10}$ which corresponds to mass transfer from more massive component to less massive with the rate of $dM/dt \sim 4.82 \times 10^{-8}8M_{\text{sun}}$/year.</p>

				<title>Why Study the Sun?</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0059-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this presentation we briefly describe the Sun through large number of illustrations and pictures of the Sun taken from early times to the present day space missions. The importance of the study of the Sun is emphasized as it is the nearest star which presents unparallelled views of surface details and numerous phenomena. Our Sun offers a unique celestial laboratory where a large variety of phenomena take place, ranging in temporal domain from a few milliseconds to several decades, in spatial domain from a few hundred kilometers to thousands of kilometers, and in the temperature domain from a few thousand degrees to several million degrees. Its mass motion ranges from thousandths to thousands of kilometers per second. Such an object provides us with a unique laboratory to study the state of matter in the Universe.</p>
					<p>The existing solar ground-based and space missions have already revealed several mysteries of the outer environment of our Sun and much more is going to come in the near future from planned new sophisticated ground-based solar telescopes and Space missions.</p>
					<p>The new technique of helioseismology has unravelled many secrets of the solar interior and has put the Standard Solar Model (SSM) on firm footing. The long-standing problem of solar neutrinos has been recently sorted out, and even the ‘back side’ view of the Sun can be seen using the technique of holographic helioseismology.</p>

				<title>Some Recent Developments in Solar Dynamo Theory</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0079-0085</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the current status of solar dynamo theory and describe the dynamo model developed by our group. The toroidal magnetic field is generated in the tachocline by the strong differential rotation and rises to the solar surface due to magnetic buoyancy to create active regions. The decay of these active regions at the surface gives rise to the poloidal magnetic field by the Babcock–Leighton mechanism. This poloidal field is advected by the meridional circulation first to high latitudes and then down below to the tachocline. Dynamo models based on these ideas match different aspects of observational data reasonably well.</p>

				<title>Nanoflares and Heating of the Solar Corona</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0093-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coronal heating by nanoflares is presented by using observational, analytical, numerical simulation and statistical results. Numerical simulations show the formation of numerous current sheets if the magnetic field is sheared and bipoles have unequal pole strengths. This fact supports the generation of nanoflares and heating by them. The occurrence frequency of transients such as flares, nano/microflares, on the Sun exhibits a power-law distribution with exponent α varying between 1.4 and 3.3. For nanoflares heating $\alpha$ must be greater than 2. It is likely that the nanoflare heating can be reproduced by dissipating Alfv´en waves. Only observations from future space missions such as Solar-B, to be launched in 2006, can shed further light on whether Alfvén waves or nanoflares, heat the solar corona.</p>

				<title>Evolving Coronal Holes and Interplanetary Erupting Stream Disturbances</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0101-0112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coronal holes and interplanetary disturbances are important aspects of the physics of the Sun and heliosphere. Interplanetary disturbances are identified as an increase in the density turbulence compared with the ambient solar wind. Erupting stream disturbances are transient large-scale structures of enhanced density turbulence in the interplanetary medium driven by the high-speed flows of low-density plasma trailing behind for several days. Here, an attempt has been made to investigate the solar cause of erupting stream disturbances, mapped by Hewish &amp; Bravo (1986) from interplanetary scintillation (IPS) measurements made between August 1978 and August 1979 at 81.5 MHz. The position of the sources of 68 erupting stream disturbances on the solar disk has been compared with the locations of newborn coronal holes and/or the areas that have been coronal holes previously. It is found that the occurrence of erupting stream disturbances is linked to the emergence of newcoronal holes at the eruption site on the solar disk.</p>
					<p>A coronal hole is indicative of a radial magnetic field of a predominant magnetic polarity. The newborn coronal hole emerges on the Sun, owing to the changes in magnetic field configuration leading to the opening of closed magnetic structure into the corona. The fundamental activity for the onset of an erupting stream seems to be a transient opening of pre-existing closed magnetic structures into a new coronal hole, which can support high-speed flow trailing behind the compression zone of the erupting stream for several days.</p>

				<title>Spectroscopic Studies of Solar Corona VI: Trend in Line-width Variation of Coronal Emission Lines with Height Independent of the Structure of Coronal Loops</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0115-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have obtained spectroscopic observations in coronal emission lines by choosing two lines simultaneously, one [Fe X] 6374 Å and the other [Fe XI] 7892 Å or [Fe XIII] 10747 Å or [Fe XIV] 5303 Å. We found that in 95 per cent of the coronal loops observed in 6374 Å, the FWHM of the emission line increases with height above the limb irrespective of the size, shape and orientation of the loop and that in case of 5303 Å line decreases with height in about 89 per cent of the coronal loops. The FWHM of 7892 Å and 10747 Å emission lines show intermediate behavior. The increase in the FWHM of 6374 Å line with height is the steepest among these four lines.We have also studied the intensity ratio and ratio of FWHM of these lines with respect to those of 6374 Å as a function height above the limb. We found that the intensity ratio of 7892 Å and 10747 Å lines with respect to 6374 Å line increases with height and that of 5303 Å to 6374 Å decreases with height above the limb. This implies that temperature in coronal loops will appear to increase with height in the intensity ratio plots of 7892 Å and 6374 Å; and 10747 Å and 6374 Å whereas it will appear to decrease with height in intensity ratio of 5303 Å to 6374 Å line <i>versus</i> height plot. These findings are up to a height of about 200 arcsec above the limb. The varying ratios with height indicate that relatively hotter and colder plasma in coronal loops interact with each other. Therefore, the observed increase in FWHM with height above the limb of coronal emission lines associated with plasma at about 1 MK may not be due to increase in non-thermal motions caused by coronal waves but due to interaction with the relatively hotter plasma. These findings also do not support the existing coronal loop models, which predict an increase in temperature of the loop with height above the limb.</p>

				<title>Magnetic Source Regions of Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0139-0149</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The majority of flare activity arises in active regions which contain sunspots, while Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) activity can also originate from decaying active regions and even so-called quiet solar regions which contain a filament. Two classes of CME, namely flare-related CME events and CMEs associated with filament eruption are well reflected in the evolution of active regions. The presence of significant magnetic stresses in the source region is a necessary condition for CME. In young active regions magnetic stresses are increased mainly by twisted magnetic flux emergence and the resulting magnetic footpoint motions. In old, decayed active regions twist can be redistributed through cancellation events. All the CMEs are, nevertheless, caused by loss of equilibrium of the magnetic structure. With observational examples we show that the association of CME, flare and filament eruption depends on the characteristics of the source regions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the strength of the magnetic field, the amount of possible free energy storage,</li>
						<li>the small- and large-scale magnetic topology of the source region as well as its evolution (new flux emergence, photospheric motions, cancelling flux), and</li>
						<li>the mass loading of the configuration (effect of gravity).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These examples are discussed in the framework of theoretical models.</p>

				<title>North–South Distribution of Solar Flares during Cycle 23</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0151-0157</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we investigate the spatial distribution of solar flares in the northern and southern hemispheres of the Sun that occurred during the period 1996 to 2003. This period of investigation includes the ascending phase, the maximum and part of the descending phase of solar cycle 23. It is revealed that the flare activity during this cycle is low compared to the previous solar cycle, indicating the violation of Gnevyshev–Ohl rule. The distribution of flares with respect to heliographic latitudes shows a significant asymmetry between northern and southern hemisphere which is maximum during the minimum phase of the solar cycle. The present study indicates that the activity dominates the northern hemisphere in general during the rising phase of the cycle (1997–2000). The dominance of northern hemisphere shifted towards the southern hemisphere after the solar maximum in 2000 and remained there in the successive years. Although the annual variations in the asymmetry time series during cycle 23 are quite different from cycle 22, they are comparable to cycle 21.</p>

				<title>Initiation of CMEs by Magnetic Flux Emergence</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0159-0166</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The initiation of solar Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is studied in the framework of numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The initial CME model includes a magnetic flux rope in spherical, axisymmetric geometry. The initial configuration consists of a magnetic flux rope embedded in a gravitationally stratified solar atmosphere with a background dipole magnetic field. The flux rope is in equilibrium due to an image current below the photosphere. An emerging flux triggering mechanism is used to make this equilibrium system unstable. When the magnetic flux emerges within the filament below the flux rope, this results in a catastrophic behavior similar to previous models. As a result, the flux rope rises and a current sheet forms below it. It is shown that the magnetic reconnection in the current sheet below the flux rope in combination with the outward curvature forces results in a fast ejection of the flux rope as observed for solar CMEs.We have done a parametric study of the emerging flux rate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report a detailed examination about the relationship between the evolution of the H$\alpha$ flare ribbons and the released magnetic energy during the April 10 2001 flare. In the H$\alpha$ images, several bright kernels are observed in the flare ribbons. We identified the conjugated footpoints, by analyzing the lightcurves at each H$\alpha$ kernels, and showed their connectivities during the flare. Then, based on the magnetic reconnection model, we calculated quantitatively the released energy by using the photospheric magnetic field strengths and separation speeds of the H$\alpha$ flare  ribbons. Finally, we examined the downward motions which are observed at the H$\alpha$ kernels. We found that the stronger the red-asymmetry tends to be associated with the brighter the H$\alpha$ kernel.</p>

				<title>Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS) Mission – Low Energy Payload – First Results</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0175-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the first results from the ‘Low Energy Detector’ payload of ‘Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS)’ mission, which was launched onboard GSAT-2 Indian spacecraft on 08 May 2003 by GSLV-D2 rocket to study the solar flares. The SOXS Low Energy Detector (SLD) payload was designed, developed and fabricated by Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in collaboration with Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC), Bangalore of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The SLD payload employs the state-of-the-art solid state detectors viz., Si PIN and Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) devices that operate at near room temperature ($-20^{\circ}$C). The dynamic energy range of Si PIN and CZT detectors are 4–25 keV and 4–56 keV respectively. The Si PIN provides sub-keV energy resolution while CZT reveals $\sim 1.7$ keV energy resolution throughout the dynamic range. The high sensitivity and sub-keV energy resolution of Si PIN detector allows the measuring of the intensity, peak energy and equivalent width of the Fe-line complex at approximately 6.7 keV as a function of time in all 8 M-class flares studied in this investigation. The peak energy ($E_{p}$) of Fe-line feature varies between 6.4 and 6.8 keV with increase in temperature from 9 to 34 MK. We found that the equivalent width ($w$) of Fe-line feature increases exponentially with temperature up to 20 MK but later it increases very slowly up to 28 MK and then it remains uniform around 1.55 keV up to 34 MK. We compare our measurements of $w$ with calculations made earlier by various investigators and propose that these measurements may improve theoretical models. We interpret the variation of both $E_{p}$ and $w$ with temperature as the changes in the ionization and recombination conditions in the plasma during the flare interval and as a consequence the contribution from different ionic emission lines also varies.</p>

				<title>Enigmatic Solar Wind Disappearance Events – Do We Understand Them?</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0201-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At the Sun–Earth distance of one astronomical unit (1 AU), the solar wind is known to be strongly supersonic and super Alfvénic with Mach and Alfvén numbers being on average 12 and 9 respectively. Also, solar wind densities (average $\sim 10$ cm$^{-3}$) and velocities (average $\sim 450$ km s$^{-1}$) at 1 AU, are known to be inversely correlated with low velocities having higher than average densities and <i>vice versa</i>. However, on May 11 and 12 1999 the Earth was engulfed by an unusually low density ($\lt 0.1$ cm$^{-3}$) and low velocity ($\lt 350$ km s$^{-1}$) solar wind with an Alfvén Mach number significantly less than 1. This was a unique low-velocity, low-density, sub-Alfvénic solar wind flow which spacecraft observations have shown lasted more than 24 hours. One consequence of this extremely tenuous solar wind was a spectacular expansion of the Earth’s magnetosphere and bow shock. The expanding bow shock was observed by several spacecraft and reached record upstream distances of nearly 60 Earth radii, the lunar orbit. The event was so dramatic that it has come to be known as <i>the solar wind disappearance event</i>. Though extensive studies of this event were made by many authors in the past, it has only been recently shown that the unusual solar wind flows characterizing this event originated from a small coronal hole in the vicinity of a large active region on the Sun. These recent results have put to rest speculation that such events are associated with global phenomenon like the periodic solar polar field reversal that occurs at the maximum of each solar cycle. In this paper we revisit the 11 May 1999 event, look at other disappearance events that have ocurred in the past, examine the reasons why speculations about the association of such events with global phenomena like solar polar field reversals were made and also examine the role of transient coronal holes as a possible solar source for such events.</p>

				<title>Transient Perturbations and their Effects in the Heliosphere, the Geo-magnetosphere, and the Earth’s Atmosphere: Space Weather Perspective</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0209-0217</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the effects of certain dynamic features of space environment in the heliosphere, the geo-magnetosphere, and the earth’s atmosphere. In particular, transient perturbations in solar wind plasma, interplanetary magnetic field, and energetic charged particle (cosmic ray) fluxes near 1 AU in the heliosphere have been discussed. Transient variations in magnetic activity in geo-magnetosphere and solar modulation effects in the heliosphere have also been studied. Emphasis is on certain features of transient perturbations related to space weather effects. Relationships between geomagnetic storms and transient modulations in cosmic ray intensity (Forbush decreases), especially those caused by shock-associated interplanetary disturbances, have been studied in detail. We have analysed the cosmic ray, geomagnetic and interplanetary plasma/field data to understand the physical mechanisms of two phenomena namely, Forbush decrease and geomagnetic storms, and to search for precursors to Forbush decrease (and geomagnetic storms) that can be used as a signature to forecast space weather. It is shown that the use of cosmic ray records has practical application for space weather predictions. Enhanced diurnal anisotropy and intensity deficit of cosmic rays have been identified as precursors to Forbush decreases in cosmic ray intensity. It is found that precursor to smaller (less than 5\%) amplitude Forbush decrease due to weaker interplanetary shock is enhanced diurnal anisotropy. However, larger amplitude (greater than 5\%) Forbush decrease due to stronger interplanetary shock shows loss cone type intensity deficit as precursor in ground based intensity record. These precursors can be used as inputs for space weather forecast.</p>

				<title>Geo-effectiveness of Solar Wind Extremes</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0227-0235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Examples of extreme events of solar wind and their effect on geomagnetic conditions are discussed here. It is found that there are two regimes of high speed solar wind streams with a threshold of $\sim 850$ km s$^{-1}$. Geomagnetic activity enhancement rate (GAER) is defined as an average increase in Ap value per unit average increase in the peak solar wind velocity (Vp) during the stream. GAER was found to be different in the two regimes of high speed streams with +ve and $-$ve IMF. GAER is 0.73 and 0.53 for solar wind streams with +ve and $-$ve IMF respectively for the extremely high speed streams ($\lt 850$ km s$^{-1}$). This indicates that streams above the threshold speed with +ve IMF are 1.4 times more effective in enhancing geomagnetic activity than those with $-$ve IMF. However, the high speed streams below the threshold with $-$ve IMF are 1.1 times more effective in enhancing geomagnetic activity than those with +ve IMF. The violent solar activity period (October–November 2003) of cycle 23 presents a very special case during which many severe and strong effects were seen in the environment of the Earth and other planets; however, the z-component of IMF (Bz) is mostly positive during this period. The most severe geomagnetic storm of this cycle occurred when Bz was positive.</p>

				<title>The Challenge of Predicting the Occurrence of Intense Storms</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0237-0242</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geomagnetic super-storms of October and November 2003 are compared in order to identify solar and interplanetary variables that influence the magnitude of geomagnetic storms. Although these super-storms (${\rm D}_{\text{ST}} \lt -300$ nT) are associated with high speed CMEs, their ${\rm D}_{\text{ST}}$ indices show large variation. The most intense storm of November 20, 2003 (${\rm D}_{\text{ST}}\sim -472$ nT) had its source in a comparatively small active region and was associated with a relatively weaker, M-class flare, while the others had their origins in large active regions and were associated with strong X-class flares. An attempt has been made to implement a logistic regression model for the prediction of the occurrence of intense/super-intense geomagnetic storms. The model parameters (regression coefficients) were estimated from a training data-set extracted from a data-set of 64 geo-effective CMEs observed during 1996–2002. The results indicate that logistic regression models can be effectively used for predicting the occurrence of major geomagnetic storms from a set of solar and interplanetary factors. The model validation shows that 100\%\ of the intense storms ($-200$ nT $\lt {\rm D}_{\text{ST}} \lt -100$ nT) and only 50\%\ of the super-intense (${\rm D}_{\text{ST}} \lt -200$ nT) storms could be correctly predicted.</p>

					<p>NOAA 10486 produced several powerful flares, including the 4B/X17.2 superflare of October 28, 2003/11:10 UT. This flare was extensively covered by the H$_{\alpha}$ and GONG instruments operated at the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO). The central location of the active region on October 28, 2003was well-suited for the ring diagram analysis to obtain the 3-D power spectra and search for helioseismic response of this large flare on the amplitude, frequency and width of the p-modes. Further, using USO observations, we have identified the sites of new flux emergences, large proper motions and line-of-sight velocity flows in the active region and their relationship with the flare.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We observed 4B/X17.2 flare in H$\alpha$ from super-active region NOAA 10486 at ARIES, Nainital. This is one of the largest flares of current solar cycle 23, which occurred near the Sun’s center and produced extremely energetic emission almost at allwavelengths from $\gamma$-ray to radio-waves. The flare is associated with a bright/fast full-halo earth directed CME, strong type II, type III and type IV radio bursts, an intense proton event and GLE. This flare is well observed by SOHO, RHESSI and TRACE. Our H$\alpha$ observations show the stretching/de-twisting and eruption of helically twisted S shaped (sigmoid) filament in the south–west direction of the active region with bright shock front followed by rapid increase in intensity and area of the gigantic flare. The flare shows almost similar evolution in H$\alpha$, EUV and UV. We measure the speed of H$\alpha$ ribbon separation and the mean value is $\sim 70$ km s$^{-1}$. This is used together with photospheric magnetic field to infer a magnetic reconnection rate at three HXR sources at the flare maximum. In this paper, we also discuss the energetics of active region filament, flare and associated CME.</p>

				<title>The Flares Associated with the Dynamics of the Sunspots</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0277-0284</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we consider six years data of spot groups that have well developed leading and following spots obtained from the Kodaikanal Observatory white light pictures and occurrence of H$\alpha$ flares. From the daily observations, we compute the variations in rotation rates, meridional velocity, the areas and longitudinal separations. We find that among all these variations, the occurrence of abnormal rotation rates (the rotation rates that have greater than $1\sigma$) and longitudinal minimum separation during the course of their evolution eventually lead to triggering of flares. We also find that the events of abnormal rotation rates, longitudinal minimum separation and the flares occur mainly during the 50–80\%\ of the sunspots’ life span indicating magnetic reconnection probably below (0.935 $R_{\odot}$) the solar surface. Relevance of these results with the conventional theory of magnetic reconnection is briefly discussed.</p>

				<title>Design and Status of Solar Vector Magnetograph (SVM-I) at Udaipur Solar Observatory</title>
				<feature>Oral Presentations</feature>
				<page>0285-0292</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the status of the instrument called Solar Vector Magnetograph Phase-I (SVM-I) currently being developed at Udaipur Solar Observatory. SVM-I is an instrument which aims to determine the magnetic field vector in the solar atmosphere by measuring Zeeman induced polarization across the spectral line. The instrument is currently in a preliminary development stage, with all components under an evaluation process. The integration of components is being done. The integrated performance of the system on a tracking mount and its control software is being tested. Some test observations of sunspots has been carried out. In this paper we give a technical description of the hardware and software elements of the instrument and present the polarized images obtained during test observations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The solar observational facilities at ARIES (erstwhile U.P. State Observatory, UPSO), Nainital, began in the sixties with the acquisition of two moderate sized (25 cm, f/66 off-axis Skew Cassegrain and 15 cm, f/15 refractor) telescopes. Both these systems receive sunlight through a 45 cm and 25 cm coelostat respectively. The backend instruments to these systems comprised of a single pass grating spectrograph for spectroscopic study of the Sun and a Bernhard–Halle $H\alpha$ filter, coupled with a Robot recorder camera for solar patrolling in $H\alpha$ respectively. With the advancement in solar observing techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution in $H\alpha$ and other wavelengths, it became inevitable to acquire sophisticated instrumentation for data acquisition. In view of that, the above facilities were upgraded, owing to which the conventional photographic techniques were replaced by the CCD camera systems attached with two 15 cm, f/15 Coude refractor telescopes. These CCD systems include the Peltier cooled CCD camera and photometrics PXL high speed modular CCD camera which provide high temporal and spatial resolution of $\sim 25$ ms and $\sim 1.3$ arcsec respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS) mission onboard GSAT-2 Indian Spacecraft was launched on 08 May 2003 using GSLV–D2 rocket by Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). SOXS aims to study solar flares, which are the most violent and energetic phenomena in the solar system, in the energy range of 4–56 keV with high spectral and temporal resolution. SOXS employs state-of-the-art semiconductor devices, viz., Si-Pin and CZT detectors to achieve sub-keV energy resolution requirements. In this paper, we present an overview of data acquisition, control, communication and computation of low energy payload of the SOXS mission.</p>

				<page>0315-0320</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The index of scintillation measurement is a good parameter to compare different sites for image quality or ‘seeing’.We have developed a scintillometer, which is deployed on the high resolution SPAR telescope in the island site of Udaipur Solar Observatory, for the site characterization to specify the proposed MAST (Multi Application Solar Telescope).</p>
					<p>The scintillometer consists of a miniature telescope, termed as micro telescope (4mm aperture, 15mm focal length) mounted on a drive which tracks the Sun continuously, associated amplifiers and a data acquisition system. A photodiode is used as the detector. The telescope along with detector was obtained from National Solar Observatory (NSO), and is similar to the one used for Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) site survey. At USO we developed the amplifier and data acquisition system for the scintillometer. A 24-bit analog to digital converter based system was designed, assembled, tested and used as the data acquisition system (DAS). In this paper, we discuss the instrumentation and present the initial results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study the spatial damping of magnetoacoustic waves in an unbounded quiescent prominence invoking the technique of MHD seismology. We consider Newtonian radiation in the energy equation and derive a fourth order general dispersion relation in terms of wavenumber $k$. Numerical solution of dispersion relation suggests that slow mode is more affected by radiation. The high frequency waves have been found to be highly damped. The uncertainty in the radiative relaxation time, however, does not allow us to conclude if the radiation is a dominant damping mechanism in quiescent prominence.</p>

				<title>Observational Searches for Chromospheric $g$-Mode Oscillations from CaII H-Line Observations</title>
				<feature>Poster Papers</feature>
				<page>0327-0331</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have used a high spatial and temporal resolution of long time sequence of spectra in CaII H-line obtained at the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) of the Sacramento Peak Observatory on a quiet region at the center of the solar disk over a large number of bright points and network elements to search for atmospheric (chromospheric) $g$-mode oscillations. An important parameter of the H-line profile, intensity at H$_{\text{2V}}$(I$_{\text{H2V}}$), has been derived from a large number of line profiles. We derived the light curves of all the bright points and network elements. The light curves represent the main pulse with large intensity amplitude and followed by several follower pulses with lower intensity amplitudes. The light curves of these bright points would give an impression that one can as well draw curves towards and away from the highest peak (main pulse) showing an exponential growth and decay of the amplitudes. An exponential decaying function has been fitted for all the light curves of the bright points to determine the damping time of the modes that are more or less the same, and one value of the coefficient of exponent can represent reasonably well the decay for all the cases. The FFT analysis of temporal variation of both the bright points and the network elements indicates around 10-min periodicity. We speculate that this longer period of oscillation may be related to chromospheric $g$-mode oscillations.</p>

					<p>The positional measurements of sunspots from the Kodaikanal Observatory and Solar Geophysical data are used to study the association between occurrence of the abnormal activities of big sunspot groups that were observed during the period of October–November 2003 and occurrence of the flares.

				<title>Study of Microflares through SOXS Mission</title>
				<feature>Poster Papers</feature>
				<page>0339-0346</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a study of 10 microflares observed in 4–30 keV by SOXS mission simultaneously with H$\alpha$ observations made at NAOJ, Japan during the interval between February and August 2004. The X-ray and H$\alpha$ light curves showed that the lifetime of microflares varies between 4 and 25 min. We found that the X-ray emission in all microflares under study in the dynamic energy range of 4–30 keV can be fitted by thermal plus non-thermal components. The thermal spectrum appeared to start from almost 4 keV, low level discriminator (LLD) of both Si and CZT detectors, however it ends below 8 keV. We also observed the Fe line complex features at 6.7 keV in some microflares and attempted to fit this line by isothermal temperature assumption. The temperature of isothermal plasma of microflares varies in the range between 8.6 and 10.1 MK while emission measure between 0.5 and $2\times 10^{49}$ cm$^{-3}$. Non-thermal (NT) emission appeared in the energy range 7–15 keV with exponent $-6.8 \leq \gamma \leq -4.8$. Our study of microflares that had occurred on 25 February 2004 showed that sometimes a given active region produces recurrent microflare activity of a similar nature.We concluded from X-ray and simultaneous H$\alpha$ observations that the microflares are perhaps the result of the interaction of low lying loops. It appears that the electrons that accelerated during reconnection heat the ambient coronal plasma as well as interact with material while moving down along the loops and thereby produce H$\alpha$ bright kernels.</p>

We have tried to study the morphology of the event, energy budget of the prominence and associated CMEs.

				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of solar wind–magnetosphere coupling is investigated for intense geomagnetic storms ($D_{\text{st}} \leq -100$ nT) that occurred during solar cycle 23. For this purpose interplanetary plasma and field data during some intensely geo-effective transient solar/interplanetary disturbances have been analysed. A geomagnetic index that represents the intensity of planetary magnetic activity at subauroral latitude and the other that measures the ring current magnetic field, together with solar plasma and field parameters (V, B, B$_{\text{z}}$, $\sigma_{\text{B}}$, N, and T) and their various derivatives (BV, $-$BVz, BV$^{2}$, $-$BzV$^{2}$, B$^{2}$V, Bz$^{2}$V, NV$^{2}$) have been analysed in an attempt to study mechanism and the cause of geo-effectiveness of interplanetary manifestations of transient solar events. Several functions of solar wind plasma and field parameters are tested for their ability to predict the magnitude of geomagnetic storm.</p>

				<title>Gravitational Clustering of Galaxies in an Expanding Universe</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0373-0379</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We inquire the phenomena of clustering of galaxies in an expanding universe from a theoretical point of view on the basis of thermodynamics and correlation functions. The partial differential equation is developed both for the point mass and extended mass structures of a two-point correlation function by using thermodynamic equations in combination with the equation of state taking gravitational interaction between particles into consideration. The unique solution physically satisfies a set of boundary conditions for correlated systems and provides a new insight into the gravitational clustering problem.</p>

				<title>QSO Pairs <i>across</i> Active Galaxies: Evidence of Blueshifts?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0381-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several QSO pairs have been reported and their redshifts determined, where the two objects in each pair are located <i>across</i> an active galaxy. The usually accepted explanation of such occurrences is that the pair is ejected from the parent galaxy. Currently interpreted redshifted spectra for both the QSOs imply that both the objects are receding from the observer. However, ejection can occur towards and away from the observer with equal probability. We argue that for a system with two QSOs lying across the parent galaxy, ejection should have occurred in opposite directions, whereby one object will be approaching us and the other will be receding from us. The former would exhibit a blueshifted spectrum. We analyse here a sample of four such pairs and show that the observed spectrum of one QSO in each pair can be interpreted as blueshifted. The other exhibits the usual redshifted spectrum. A scenario based on the ‘sling-shot’ mechanism of ejection is presented to explain the occurrences of the pairs in opposite sides of the active galaxies moving in opposite directions.</p>

				<title>Report on the Dynamical Evolution of an Axially Symmetric Quasar Model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0389-0397</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The role of the angular momentum in the regular or chaotic character of motion in an axially symmetric quasar model is examined. It is found that, for a given value of the critical angular momentum $L_{zc}$, there are two values of the mass of the nucleus $M_{n}$ for which transition from regular to chaotic motion occurs. The $[L_{zc}-M_{n}]$ relationship shows a linear dependence for the time independent model and an exponential dependence for the evolving model. Both cases are explained using theoretical arguments together with some numerical evidence. The evolution of the orbits is studied, as mass is transported from the disk to the nucleus. The results are compared with the outcomes derived for galactic models with massive nuclei.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have constructed two gas-phase models to study the chemistry of circumstellar envelope surrounding the carbon-rich variable star IRAS 15194–5115. The network used consists of 3893 reactions involving 397 gas-phase species. The derived fractional abundances for many molecules are in excellent agreement with values obtained from observations. The predicted column densities from the two models go well with the observed values of carbon star IRC + 10216. The dominant formation routes for three groups of species are discussed through the inner and outer envelopes.</p>

				<title>Orbital Evolution and Orbital Phase Resolved Spectroscopy of the HMXB Pulsar 4U 1538–52 with RXTE-PCA and BeppoSAX</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0411-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here results from detailed timing and spectral studies of the high mass X-ray binary pulsar 4U 1538–52 over several binary periods using observations made with the Rossi X-rayTiming Explorer (RXTE) and BeppoSAX satellites. Pulse timing analysis with the 2003 RXTE data over two binary orbits confirms an eccentric orbit of the system. Combining the orbitial parameters determined from this observation with the earlier measurements we did not find any evidence of orbital decay in this X-ray binary. We have carried out orbital phase resolved spectroscopy to measure changes in the spectral parameters with orbital phase, particularly the absorption column density and the iron line flux. The RXTE-PCA spectra in the 3–20 keV energy range were fitted with a power law and a high energy cut-off alongwith a Gaussian line at $\sim 6.4$ keV, whereas the BeppoSAX spectra needed only a power law and Gaussian emission line at $\sim 6.4$ keV in the restricted energy range of 0.3–10.0 keV. An absorption along the line of sight was included for both the RXTE and BeppoSAX data. The variation of the free spectral parameters over the binary orbit was investigated and we found that the variation of the column density of absorbing material in the line of sight with orbital phase is in reasonable agreement with a simple model of a spherically symmetric stellar wind from the companion star.</p>

				<title>Analysis of Enhanced Velocity Signals Observed during Solar Flares</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0425-0438</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solar flares are known to release a large amount of energy. It is believed that the flares can excite velocity oscillations in active regions. We report here the changes in velocity signals in three active regions which have produced large X-class flares. The enhanced velocity signals appeared during the rise time of the GOES soft X-ray flux. These signals are located close to the vicinity of the hard X-ray source regions as observed with RHESSI. The power maps of the active region show enhancement in the frequency regime 5–6.5 mHz, while there is feeble or no enhancement of these signals in 2–4 mHz frequency band. High energy particles with sufficient momentum seem to be the cause for these observed enhanced velocity signals.</p>

					<p>New limits of the shielding coefficients in the supposed phenomenon of gravitation shielding have recently become available. The new values are briefly reviewed and discussed in order to update the state of art since some new limits for gravitation shielding are not necessarily the lowest ones which, instead, are those of interest when planning new experimental research or studying theoretically the possible effects of gravitation shielding.</p>

				<title>Interpretation of the Global Anisotropy in the Radio Polarizations of Cosmologically Distant Sources</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0443-0454</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a detailed statistical study of the observed anisotropy in radio polarizations from distant extragalactic objects. This anisotropy was earlier found by Birch (1982) and reconfirmed by Jain and Ralston (1999) in a larger data set. A very strong signal was seen after imposing the cut $|RM-\overline{RM}| \gt 6$ rad/m$^{2}$, where $RM$ is the rotation measure and $\overline{RM}$ its mean value. In this paper, we show that there are several indications that this anisotropy cannot be attributed to bias in the data. We also find that a generalized statistic shows a very strong signal in the entire data without imposing the $RM$ dependent cut. Finally we argue that an anisotropic background pseudoscalar field can explain the observations.</p>

				<title>Long-term Modulation of Cosmic Ray Intensity in relation to Sunspot Numbers and Tilt Angle</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0455-0464</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed correlative analysis between sunspot numbers (SSN) and tilt angle (TA) with cosmic ray intensity (CRI) in the neutron monitor energy range has been performed for the solar cycles 21, 22 and 23. It is found that solar activity parameters (SSN and TA) are highly (positive) correlated with each other and have inverse correlation with cosmic ray intensity (CRI). The ‘running cross correlation coefficient’ between cosmic ray intensity and tilt angle has also been calculated and it is found that the correlation is positive during the maxima of odd cycles 21 and 23. Moreover, the time lag analysis between CRI and SSN, and between CRI and TA has also been performed and is supported by hysteresis curves, which are wide for odd cycles and narrow for even cycles.</p>
