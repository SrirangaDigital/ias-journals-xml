				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0893-0909</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-delayed nonlinear evolution equations and boundary value problems have a wide range of applications in science and engineering. In this paper, we implement the differential transform method to solve the nonlinear delay differential equation and boundary value problems. Also, we present some numerical examples including time-delayed nonlinear Burgers equation to illustrate the validity and the great potential of the differential transform method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the use and computational efﬁciency of the method. This method can easily be applied to many nonlinear problems and is capable of reducing the size of computational work.</p>

				<page>0911-0924</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Studying compactons, solitons, solitary patterns and periodic solutions is important in nonlinear phenomena. In this paper we study nonlinear variants of the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP) and the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equations with positive and negative exponents. The functional variable method is used to establish compactons, solitons, solitary patterns and periodic solutions for these variants. This method is a powerful tool for searching exact travelling solutions in closed form.</p>

				<title>Pitchfork bifurcation and vibrational resonance in a fractional-order Duffing oscillator</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0943-0957</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pitchfork bifurcation and vibrational resonance are studied in a fractional-order Duffing oscillator with delayed feedback and excited by two harmonic signals. Using an approximation method, the bifurcation behaviours and resonance patterns are predicted. Supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations can be induced by the fractional-order damping, the exciting highfrequency signal and the delayed time. The fractional-order damping mainly determines the pattern of the vibrational resonance. There is a bifurcation point of the fractional order which, in the case of double-well potential, transforms vibrational resonance pattern from a single resonance to a double resonance, while in the case of single-well potential, transforms vibrational resonance from no resonance to a single resonance. The delayed time influences the location of the vibrational resonance and the bifurcation point of the fractional order. Pitchfork bifurcation is the necessary condition for the double resonance. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the numerical simulations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>By exploiting the supersymmetry-inspired factorization method through a judicious use of deuteron ground state wave function, higher partial wave nucleon–nucleon potentials, both energy independent and energy dependent, are generated.

				<title>A clean signal for a top-like isosinglet fermion at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0975-0986</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We predict a clean signal at the Large Hadron Collider ($\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV) for a scenario where there is a top-like, charge +2/3 vector-like isosinglet fermion. Such a quark, via mixing with the standard model top, can undergo decays via both flavour-changing Z-boson coupling and flavour-changing Yukawa interactions. We concentrate on the latter channel, and study the situation where, following its pair production, the heavy quark pair gives rise to two tops and two Higgs bosons. We show that when each Higgs decays in the $b\bar{b}$ channel, there can be a rather distinct and background-free signal that can unveil the existence of the vector-like isosinglet quark of this kind.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0987-0994</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we present an experimental approach to track coarsening process of foam using a computer optical mouse as a dynamic laser speckle measurement sensor. The dynamics of foam coarsening and rearrangement events cause changes in the intensity of laser speckle backscattered from the foam. A strong negative correlation between the average speed of the cursor and the evolution of bubble diameter was found. We used microscopic images to demonstrate that decrease in speed is related to increase in bubble size. The proposed set-up is not very expensive, is highly portable and can be used in laboratory measurements of dynamics in other kinds of opaque materials.</p>

				<title>High harmonic generation in H$_2^+$ and HD$^+$ by two-colour femtosecond laser pulses</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0995-1007</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have theoretically investigated the high harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of H$_2^+$ and HD$^+$ using a time-dependent wave packet approach for the nuclear motion with combined twocolour (1$\omega_L$–3$\omega_L$) pulsed lasers for ωL corresponding to wavelengths 1064 nm and 800 nm. The 1$\omega_L$ and 3$\omega_L$ lasers have peak intensities of $I_1^0 = 5.0 \times 10^{13}$ W/cm$^2$ and $I_2^0 = 2.0 \times 10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$, respectively. We have taken the pulse duration of $T = 50$ fs for both the fields, and the molecular initial vibrational level $v_0 = 0$. We have argued that for these combinations, the harmonic generation due to transitions in the electronic continuum by tunnelling or multiphoton ionization may be neglected and only the electronic transitions within the two lowest electronic states would be important. Thus, the characteristic features of HHG spectra in the two-colour field are determined, in our model, by the nuclear motions on the two lowest field-coupled electronic states between which interelectronic and intraelectronic (due to the intrinsic dipole moments in case of HD$^+$) radiative transitions can take place. We have studied the role of relative phase ($\varphi$) of the two fields on the HHG spectra of the molecular ions. In case of HD$^+$, the effect of nonadiabatic (NA) nonradiative interaction between the two lowest Born–Oppenheimer (BO) electronic states (1$s\sigma_g$, 2$p\sigma_u$) has been taken into account. Our calculations give realistic HHG spectra which are reasonably efficient and extended for both H$_2^+$ and HD$^+$ in the mixed two-colour field without involving the electronic continuum. The use of two-colour (1$\omega_L$–3$\omega_L$) field enables us to generate high harmonics beyond that achievable with a single 1$\omega_L$ or 3$\omega_L$ field of the corresponding intensity, frequency and pulse time.</p>

				<title>Statistical model of stress corrosion cracking based on extended form of Dirichlet energy</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1009-1019</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mechanism of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) has been discussed for decades. Here I propose a model of SCC reflecting the feature of fracture in brittle manner based on the variational principle under approximately supposed thermal equilibrium. In that model the functionals are expressed with extended forms of Dirichlet energy, and Dirichlet principle is applied to them to solve the variational problem that represents SCC and normal extension on pipe surface. Based on the model and the maximum entropy principle, the statistical nature of SCC colony is discussed and it is indicated that the crack has discrete energy and length under ideal isotropy of materials and thermal equilibrium.</p>

				<title>Phonon dispersions in graphene sheet and single-walled carbon nanotubes</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1021-1035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present research paper, phonons in graphene sheet have been calculated by constructing a dynamical matrix using the force constants derived from the second-generation reactive empirical bond order potential by Brenner and co-workers. Our results are comparable to inelastic X-ray scattering as well as first principle calculations. At $\Gamma$ point, for graphene, the optical modes (degenerate) lie near 1685 cm$^{−1}$. The frequency regimes are easily distinguishable. The lowfrequency ($\omega \to 0$) modes are derived from acoustic branches of the sheet. The radial modes can be identified with $\omega \to 584$ cm$^{−1}$. High-frequency regime is above 1200 cm$^{−1}$ (i.e. ZO mode) and consists of TO and LO modes. The phonons in a nanotube can be derived from zone folding method using phonons of a single layer of the hexagonal sheet. The present work aims to explore the agreement between theory and experiment. A better knowledge of the phonon dispersion of graphene is highly desirable to model and understand the properties of carbon nanotubes. The development and production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for possible applications need reliable and quick analytical characterization. Our results may serve as an accurate tool for the spectroscopic determination of the tube radii and chiralities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>For a finite $m$ boson system, the ensemble-averaged state density has been computed with respect to the body interaction rank $k$. The shape of such a state density changes from Gaussian to semicircle as the body rank of the interaction increases. This state density is expressed as a linear superposition of Gaussian and semicircular states. The nearest-neighbour spacing distribution (NNSD), which is one of the most important spectral properties of a system, is studied. The NNSDs are rather independent of body rank $k$ and show a Wigner distribution throughout.</p>

				<title>Imaging unsteady three-dimensional transport phenomena</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0003-0014</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Careful and continuous measurements of flow, heat and mass transfer are required in quite a few contexts. Using appropriate light sources, it is possible to map velocity, temperature, and species concentration over a cross-section and as a function of time. Image formation in optical measurements may rely on scattering of radiation from particles. Alternatively, if the region of interest is transparent, refractive index would be a field variable and beam bending effects can be used to extract information about temperature and concentration of solutes dissolved in liquids. Time-lapsed images of light intensity can be used to determine fluid velocity. Though used originally for flow visualization, optical imaging has now emerged as a powerful tool for quantitative measurements. Optical methods that utilize the dependence of refractive index on concentration and temperature can be configured in many different ways. Three available routes considered are interferometry, schlieren imaging, and shadowgraph. Images recorded in these configurations can be analysed to yield time sequences of three-dimensional distributions of the transported variables. Optical methods are non-intrusive, inertia-free and can image cross-sections of the experimental apparatus. The image data can be jointly analysed with the physical laws governing transport and principles of image formation. Hence, with the experiment suitably carried out, three-dimensional physical domains with unsteady processes can be accommodated. Optical methods promise to breach the holy grail of measurements by extracting unsteady three-dimensional data in applications related to transport phenomena.</p>

				<title>High-power Yb-doped continuous-wave and pulsed fibre lasers</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0015-0027</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High-power laser generation using Yb-doped double-clad fibres with conversion efficiencies in excess of 80&#37; have attracted much attention during the last decade due to their inherent advantages in terms of very high efficiency, no misalignment due to in-built intracore fibre Bragg gratings, low thermal problems due to large surface to volume ratio, diffraction-limited beam quality, compactness, reliability and fibre-optic beam delivery. Yb-doped fibres can also provide a wide emission band from $\tilde$1010 nm to $\tilde$1170 nm, which makes it a versatile laser medium to realize continuous-wave (CW), Q-switched short pulse, and mode-locked ultrashort pulse generation for various applications. In this article, a review of Yb-doped CW and pulsed fibre lasers along with our study on self-pulsing dynamics in CW fibre lasers to find its role in high-power fibre laser development and the physical mechanisms involved in its generation has been described. A study on the generation of high-power CWfibre laser of 165Woutput power and generation of high peak power nanosecond pulses from acousto-optic Q-switched fibre laser has also been presented.</p>

				<title>Development of coherent tunable source in 2–16 $\mu$m region using nonlinear frequency mixing processes</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0029-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A very convenient way to obtain widely tunable source of coherent radiation in the infrared region is through nonlinear frequency mixing processes like second harmonic generation (SHG), difference-frequency mixing (DFM) or optical parametric oscillation (OPO). Using commonly available Nd:YAG laser and its harmonic pumped dye laser radiation as parent beams, we have been able to generate coherent tunable infrared radiation (IR) in 2–16 $\mu$m region using different nonlinear crystals by DFM and OPO. We have also generated such IR source in the 4–5 $\mu$m region through SHG of CO$_2$ laser in different infrared crystals. In the process we have characterized a large number of nonlinear crystals like different borate group of crystals, KTP, KTA, LiIO$_3$, MgO:LiNbO$_3$, GaSe, AgGaSe$_2$, ZnGeP$_2$, AgGa$_{1−x}$In$_x$Se$_2$, HgGa$_2$S$_4$ etc. To improve the conversion efficiencies of such frequency conversion processes, we have developed some novel schemes, like multipass configuration (MC) and positive optical feedback (POF). The significance of the obtained results lies in the fact that to get the same conversion in SHG or DFM, one now requires fundamental input radiation with much lower intensity.</p>

				<title>Optical fibre probes in the measurement of scattered light: Application for sensing turbidity</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0039-0048</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optical fibre probes or optrodes often form the heart of multimode fibre-based measurements and sensors. An optrode usually comprises a bundle of multimode fibres, out of which one or more fibres are used for irradiating the sample, and the remaining fibres are used to collect the light reflected/scattered/fluoresced from the sample containing the measurand(s). The so-collected light carries the characteristic signature of the measurand. Here we present our work on the design and realization of optrodes for the measurement of scattered light from liquid samples. Optical properties of a solution are usually characterized by the parameters absorption coefficient $\mu_a$, scattering coefficient $\mu_s$, and anisotropy factor $g$. We have developed a simple method to determine $\mu_a$, $\mu_s$, and $g$, of a turbid medium, and a Monte–Carlo model was used to simulate the light scattering from the turbid medium. As an application, we describe the development of a turbidity sensor that has been designed and realized by employing an optrode in conjunction with a concave mirror. The estimation of turbidity is done on the basis of total interaction, by considering scattering and absorption of light from the sample solution. Details of the experiments and results are presented here.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The acronym MLIS (molecular laser isotope separation) defines the laser process whereby the isotopes of uranium can be separated by mid-infrared laser/s when the molecule employed is UF$_6$. The theoretical and spectroscopical data to configure and enable experiments and demonstrations in the laboratory is adequate. However, the engineering and commercial aspects require innovative technology solutions that are not presently available in the literature on these topics. This paper is an overview of the most salient features of MLIS and its potential utility at an industrial level.</p>

				<title>Subwavelength propagation and localization of light using surface plasmons: A brief perspective</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0059-0070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface plasmons at the metal–dielectric interface have emerged as an important candidate to propagate and localize light at subwavelength scales. By tailoring the geometry and arrangement of metallic nanoarchitectures, propagating and localized surface plasmons can be obtained. In this brief perspective, we discuss: (1) how surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and localized surface plasmons (LSPs) can be optically excited in metallic nanoarchitectures by employing a variety of optical microscopy methods; (2) how SPPs and LSPs in plasmonic nanowires can be utilized for subwavelength polarization optics and single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) on a photonic chip; and (3) how individual plasmonic nanowire can be optically manipulated using optical trapping methods.</p>

				<title>Compact, common path quantitative phase microscopic techniques for imaging cell dynamics</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0071-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microscopy using visible electromagnetic radiation can be used to investigate living cells in various environments. But bright field microscopy only provides two-dimensional (2D) intensity distribution at a single object plane. One of the ways to retrieve object height/thickness information is to employ quantitative phase microscopic (QPM) techniques. Interferometric QPM techniques are widely used for this. Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is one of the stateof-the-art methods for quantitative three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Usually it is implemented in two-beam geometry, which is prone to mechanical vibrations. But to study dynamics of objects like red blood cells, one needs temporal stability much better than the fluctuations of the object, which the two-beam geometry fails to deliver. One way to overcome this hurdle is to use selfreferencing techniques, in which a portion of the object beam will act as the reference beam. Here the development of self-referencing QPM techniques is described along with the results.</p>

				<title>Attosecond-correlated dynamics of two electrons in argon</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work we explored strong field-induced decay of doubly excited transient Coulomb complex Ar$^{\ast\ast} \to $Ar$^{2+}$+2$e$. We measured the correlated two-electron emission as a function of carrier envelop phase (CEP) of 6 fs pulses in the non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) of argon. Classical model calculations suggest that the intermediate doubly excited Coulomb complex loses memory of its formation dynamics. We estimated the ionization time difference between the two electrons from NSDI of argon and it is 200 $\pm$ 100 as (N Camus $\textit{et al, Phys. Rev. Lett}$. ${\bf 108}$, 073003 (2012)).</p>

				<title>Progress in sub-femtosecond control of electron localization in molecules</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0087-0095</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent advances in controlled generation of intense, ultrashort laser pulses in the femtosecond and attosecond time-scales have pushed new avenues of research in the coherent control of ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms and molecules. We present a topical review on the phenomenon of control of electron localization in small dissociating molecules. By creating and controlling coherent superposition of the symmetric and antisymmetric electronic states, it becomes possible to confine the evolving electron cloud onto a preferred nucleus, thereby steering the molecule towards a desired dissociation route. We discuss the origin of the idea and various mechanisms to achieve electron localization in small molecules. To highlight recent experimental progress, we explain how one can employ few-cycle IR pulses and different attosecond extreme ultraviolet (EUV) pulses in various ways to successfully demonstrate the control of electronic dynamics. Future research opportunities and challenges on this topic are envisioned.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of ultrashort [nanosecond (ns)/picosecond (ps)/femtosecond (fs)] pulses with materials is an exhaustive area of research with underlying, and often extremely rich, physics along with a plethora of applications evolving from it. High-energy materials (HEMs) are chemical compounds or mixture of compounds which, under suitable initiation, undergoes a very rapid exothermic and self-propagating decomposition. Herein, we describe the interaction of laser pulses with materials and its implications for studies on HEMs in four parts: (a) ns and fs laserinduced breakdown spectroscopic (LIBS) studies of HEMs towards understanding the molecular dynamics and discrimination, (b) ps/fs pulses interaction with metallic solids towards the production of nanoparticles, nanostructures and their utility in identifying explosive molecules using surface-enhanced Raman scattering studies, (c) interaction of laser pulses with the bulk and surface of glasses and polymers producing micro- and nanostructures for microfluidic/lab-on-a-chip applications, and (d) ultrafast spectroscopic studies for comprehending the excited state dynamics towards elucidation of vibrational dynamics in HEMs. Several applications resulting from these interactions will be discussed in detail.</p>

				<title>Probing strong field ionization of solids with a Thomson parabola spectrometer</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0111-0120</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Intense ultrashort laser pulses are known to generate high-density, high-temperature plasma from any substrate. Copious emission of hot electrons, from a solid substrate, results in strong electrostatic field that accelerates the ions with energies ranging from a few eV to MeV. Ion spectrometry from laser–plasma is convolved with multiple atomic systems, several charge states and a broad energy spread. Conventional mass spectrometric techniques have serious limitations to probe this ionization dynamics. We have developed an imaging ion spectrometer that measures charge/mass-resolved ion kinetic energies over the entire range. Microchannel plate (MCP) is used as the position-sensitive detector to perform online and single shot measurements. The wellresolved spectrum even for the low-energy ions, demonstrates that the spectral width is limited by the space-charge repulsion for the ions generated in the hot dense plasma.</p>

					<p>A principal limitation of single-molecule spectroscopy in solution is the diffusionlimited residence time of a given molecule within the detection volume. A common solution to this problem is to immobilize molecules of interest on a passivated glass surface for extending the observation time to obtain reliable data statistics. However, surface tethering of molecules often introduces artifacts, particularly when studying the structural dynamics of biomolecules. To circumvent this limitation, we investigated alternative ways to extend single-molecule observation times in solution without surface immobilization. Among various possibilities, the so-called anti-Brownian electro-kinetic trap (or ABEL trap) seems best suited to achieve this goal. The essential part of this trap is a feedback-controlled electro-kinetic steering of a molecule’s position in reaction to its diffusive Brownian motion which is monitored by fluorescence, thus keeping the molecule within a sub-micron sized detection volume. Fluorescence trace recordings of over thousands of milliseconds duration on individual dye molecules within an ABEL trap have been reported. In this short review, we shall briefly discuss the principle and some results of ABEL trapping of individual molecules with possible extensions to future works.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the state of the art of using a solid-state Nd:YAG laser for material processing applications such as cutting, welding and drilling of several components of operational nuclear reactors in radioactive environment. We have demonstrated several advantages of laserbased material processing over conventional methods, and these are discussed briefly. At NPCIL, we have used laser techniques to cut stainless steel sheets up to 14 mm thickness and stainless steel weld up to a depth of 3 mm. This remotely operable laser system has been engineered for its robustness with proper fixtures and tooling for various material processing operations on industrial scale.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presents results of a theoretical model of a pulsed electron beam controlled CO$_2$ laser (EBCL) to investigate the effect of cooling on the laser gas mixture. It is shown that cryogenic cooling can significantly improve the performance of the laser. The efficiency of an EBCL improved from 20&#37; to 25.3&#37; by cooling it to 200 K. The improvement is mainly due to the decrease of thermal population of the CO$_2$ (0 1 0) vibration level.</p>

				<title>Enhanced performance of a repetitively pulsed 130 mJ KrF laser with improved pre-ionization parameters</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0153-0157</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Studies related to the effect of pre-ionizer on laser output energy of a repetitively pulsed KrF laser are presented. The dependence of laser output energy, spectral width and beam spot homogeneity on pre-ionization parameters, namely its current and voltage rise time are reported here. Here, effectiveness of pre-ionization is optimized by improving pre-ionization current and rise time of the pump pulse of the automatic UV pre-ionizer KrF laser. It is observed that by increasing pre-ionization current from 6 kA to 10.6 kA, the output energy increases by about 30&#37; (from 100 to 130 mJ). It is also observed that the emission spectral width reduces by almost 60&#37; by increasing the pre-ionization current. Regular homogeneous and well-developed beam spot (nearly Hat-Top profile) was achieved under these optimized conditions.</p>

				<title>Measurement of the figure of merit of indigenously developed Nd-doped phosphate laser glass rods for use in high power lasers</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0159-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High energy, high power (HEHP) Nd:glass laser systems are used for inertial confinement fusion and equation of state (EOS) studies of materials at high temperature and pressure. A program has been undertaken for the indigenous development of Nd-doped phosphate laser glass rods and discs for HEHP lasers. In this paper, we report the characterization of the Nd-doped phosphate laser glass rods produced under this program and compare the indigenously developed laser glass to LHG-8 laser glass of M/s Hoya, Japan. We experimentally measured the values of the stimulated emission cross-section ($\sigma$) and coefficient of intensity-dependent refractive index ($n_2$) and hence the figure of merit $F = \sigma/n_2$ of the indigenous phosphate laser glass rods. This value of figure of merit is found comparable to the reported value of identically doped Nd:glass rods.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Development of a discharge-pumped krypton chloride (KrCl) laser operating at 222 nm wavelength is demonstrated. In this paper the design, successful realization and operating characteristics of KrCl excimer laser are reported. The laser is driven by a simple and efficient excitation technique using automatic UV pre-ionization with discharge-pumped self-sustained capacitor– capacitor (C–C) energy transfer circuit. The experimental investigations including output laser energy, temporal pulse parameters, emission spectra and beam profile of the KrCl laser were recorded. For high repetition rate operation, in-built, compact gas circulation system using tangential blower was incorporated. The laser was operated at 25 kV discharge voltage, gas mixture of 5 mbar HCl, 160 mbar kypton and neon as balance with a total gas pressure of $\tilde$2.5 bar. These experiments produced an efficient and reliable output energy of 25 mJ from an active volume of 60 cm$^3$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Frequency corresponding to the energy difference between designated levels of an atom provides precise reference for making a universally accurate clock. Since the middle of the 20th century till now, there have been tremendous efforts in the field of atomic clocks making time the most accurately measured physical quantity. National Physical Laboratory India (NPLI) is the nation’s timekeeper and is developing an atomic fountain clock which will be a primary frequency standard. The fountain is currently operational and is at the stage of complete frequency evaluation. In this paper, a brief review on atomic time along with some of the recent results from the fountain clock will be discussed.</p>

				<title>LOPUT Laser: A novel concept to realize single longitudinal mode laser</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0185-0190</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We propose a novel type of cavity design to generate single longitudinal mode laser known as LOPUT cavity. LOPUT cavity stands for linear orthogonally polarized modes resulting in unidirectional travelling wave cavity. The technique can be applied to both isotropic as well as anisotropic gain mediums. In the present paper, we applied the technique to anisotropic gain medium such as a-cut Nd:YVO$_4$. Using the LOPUT cavity, we demonstrated nearly 2 W of single longitudinal mode laser with nearly diffraction-limited spatial profile. Linewidth measurement using a custom-made Fabry Perot interferometer revealed instrument-limited linewidth of $\tilde$5 MHz at 1064 nm.</p>

A KTP crystal cut for type-II phase matching was used for intracavity sum frequency generation in the cavity at an appropriate location for efficient and stable yellow output power. More than 550 mW of stable CW yellow-orange beam at 593.5 nm with beam quality parameter ($M^2$) $\tilde$ 4.3 was obtained. The total pump to yellow beam conversion efficiency was estimated to be 3.83&#37;.</p>

				<title>Measurement of flow fluctuations in single longitudinal mode pulsed dye laser</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0203-0210</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simple technique had been demonstrated for measuring flow-induced fluctuations in the single longitudinal mode (SLM) pulsed dye laser. Two prominent frequency components of 10.74 Hz and 48.83 Hz were present in the output of the Nd:YAG-pumped SLM dye laser. The flow-induced frequency component of 48.83 Hz was present due to the revolution per minute of the motor attached to the magnetically coupled gear pump. The time average bandwidth of 180 MHz has been obtained for this SLM dye laser. The effect of pump pulse energy on the bandwidth of the SLM dye laser was studied. The bandwidth of the SLM dye laser was increased to 285 MHz from 180 MHz, when the pump pulse energy was increased to 0.75 mJ from 0.15 mJ for a constant dye flow velocity of 0.5 m/s.</p>

				<title>Efficient delivery of 60 J pulse energy of long pulse Nd:YAG laser through 200 $\mu$m core diameter optical fibre</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0211-0216</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most of today’s industrial Nd:YAG lasers use fibre-optic beam delivery. In such lasers, fibre core diameter is an important consideration in deploying a beam delivery system. Using a smaller core diameter fibre allows higher irradiances at focus position, less degradation of beam quality, and a larger stand-off distance. In this work, we have put efforts to efficiently deliver the laser output of ‘ceramic reflector’-based long pulse Nd:YAG laser through a 200 $\mu$m core diameter optical fibre and successfully delivered up to 60 J of pulse energy with 90&#37; transmission efficiency, using a GRADIUM (axial gradient) plano-convex lens to sharply focus down the beam on the end face of the optical fibre and fibre end faces have been cleaved to achieve higher surface damage thresholds.</p>

				<title>Development of copper bromide laser master oscillator power amplifier system</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0217-0225</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Development of master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) system of copper bromide laser (CBL) operating at 110 W average power is reported. The spectral distribution of power at green (510.6 nm) and yellow (578.2 nm) components in the output of a copper bromide laser is studied as a function of operating parameters. The electrical input power was varied from 2.6 to 4.3 kW, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was changed from 16 to 19 kHz, and the pressure of the buffer gas (neon) was kept fixed at 20 mbar. When the electrical input power was increased to 4.3 kW from 2.6 kW, the tube-wall temperature also increased to 488$^\circ$C from 426$^\circ$C but the ratio of the green to yellow power decreased to 1.53 from 3.73. The ratio of green to yellow power decreased to 1.53 from 1.63 when the PRF of the laser was increased to 19 kHz from 16 kHz. These observations are explained in terms of electron temperature, energy levels of transitions, and voltage and current waveforms across the laser head.</p>

					<p>Well-resolved multimode laser emission was observed for the first time from a freestanding microring cavity based on Rhodamine B dye-doped hollow polymer optical fibre by transverse pumping. Fibres with different diameters such as 180, 460, 640 and 800 $\mu$m were fabricated from a dye-doped hollow polymer preform. A blueshift in the mode structure was observed with decrease in fibre diameter leading to wide range tunability of the laser emission.</p>

				<title>Laser-assisted surface cleaning of metallic components</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0237-0242</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Removal of a thin oxide layer from a tungsten ribbon and ThO$_2$ particulates from zircaloy surface was achieved using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The removal mechanism of the oxide layer from the tungsten ribbon was identified as spallation or sublimation depending on the wavelength and fluence of the coherent radiation. The oxidized and cleaned surfaces were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Laser-cleaned tungsten ribbons were used in a thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) to determine isotopic composition of neodymium atoms. The fundamental (1064 nm) and the third harmonic (355 nm) radiations were found to be the most effective in removing ThO$_2$ particulates from the zircaloy surface. Decontamination efficiency was found to be critically dependent on the wavelength of the coherent radiation and number of exposures. The mechanism of cleaning of ThO$_2$ particulates from the zircaloy surface at different wavelengths of the incident radiation has been explained qualitatively.</p>

				<title>Versatile laser microfabrication techniques for lab-on-chip devices in general and uranium analysis in particular</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0243-0248</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a plethora of microfabrication processes available now-a-days, one needs to choose the best possible option suitable for the job on-hand. This paper discusses three versatile approaches to fabricate microchips for lab-on-chip (LOC) applications in general and uranium analysis in water samples as a specific case. Laser-direct patterning succeeded by soft lithography, laser micropatterning followed by HF etching and micromilling have been demonstrated which not only suit the objective of uranium detection but also for most of the LOC applications. The different techniques elaborated enable development of LOCs in polymers as well as glass with a depth ranging from few microns to 100 $\mu$m or higher while squeezing the reaction lengths of $\tilde$10 cm on a 20 mm $\times$ 32 mm chip. This development equips one to design and develop more complicated LOC devices to take advantage of their hastened reaction cycle with minimal waste in terms of capital and maintenance cost.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We simulate adaptive feedback control to coherently shape a femtosecond infrared laser pulse by means of a 4f-spatial light modulator in order to selectively excite the rovibrational modes of a polyatomic molecule. We preferentially populate an arbitrarily chosen upper rovibrational level by only employing these tailored temporally shaped pulses.

Alternatively the excited molecules enhanced reactivity could be exploited for selective chemistry.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the study on development of tilted fibre Bragg gratings using highly coherent 255 nm radiation, obtained from the second harmonic generation (SHG) of copper vapour laser (CVL). The transmission and reflection spectra of the tilted fibre Bragg gratings (TFBG) were studied for the tilt angles of 0$^\circ$ (normal FBG), 1$^\circ$, 3$^\circ$ and 4$^\circ$ between the fibre axis and the interference fringe plane. It was observed that as the angle of fibre axis and phase mask increased, the main Bragg peak shifted towards the higher wavelength and transmission dip decreased. The transmission dip of the cladding mode first increased and then decreased after reaching a maximum with the increase in the tilt angle.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photopolymer systems can produce good image quality holograms that does not require any post-processing and are environmentally stable with good diffraction efficiency. The present work reports the development of a methylene blue-sensitized polyvinyl alcohol acrylamide (MBPVA/AA) photopolymer system for recording white light reflection holograms. Reflection gratings were recorded in the photopolymer films with different concentrations of methylene blue (MB). Various parameters affecting the holographic properties of the samples were also studied. The holographic performance of the material is found to depend on its chemical composition and the recording parameters.</p>

				<title>HF-based clad etching of fibre Bragg grating and its utilization in concentration sensing of laser dye in dye–ethanol solution</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0265-0269</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based sensor to study the concentration of laser dye in dye–ethanol solution. The FBG used in this experiment is indigenously developed using 255 nm UV radiations from copper vapour laser. The cladding of the FBG was partially removed using HF-based etching to make FBG sensitive to changes in the surrounding refractive index. The experimental results on the shift of the Bragg peak wavelength with HF etching and different dye concentration in ethanol are presented. The Bragg wavelength shifted from 1534.670 nm to 1534.225 nm in 30 min and from this point to 1533.97 in the next 2 min. The clad-etched Bragg peak shifted almost linearly from 1534.056 nm to 1534.162 nm as surrounding dye concentration in ethanol changes from 0 mM to 1.5 mM. It was observed that sensitivity depends on the concentration of the solution and found to be 70 pm/mM.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Recent demonstration in augmenting the efficiency of aqueous Rhodamine dye lasers using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), a deaggregating and photostabilizing host, has drawn interest in the synthesis and characterization of spectroscopic grade CB[7] in larger quantities. Synthesis of cucurbituril group of macrocycles always leads to the formation of various homologues of CB[n]s (n=5–7) with CB[7] as the minor product. The literature procedure has been optimized to get pure CB[7] in 12–14&#37; yield by fractional crystallization and the purity was checked by NMR, MS and spectrophotometric titration. Laser performances of the synthesized and commercial CB[7] sample as an additive were evaluated using Nd-YAG (532 nm) pumped Rhodamine B aqueous dye lasers and comparable results were obtained.</p>

				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0277-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum yield of fluorescence (QYF) of widely used Rhodamine (RhB) dye in ethanol and water was observed to decrease rapidly with increase in temperature of the dye solutions, which was correlated to enhanced torsional motion of its flexible diethylamino groups. This is harmful for its use in high-average power dye lasers, pumped by copper vapour laser (CVL) or diodepumped solid-state green laser (DPSSGL), in which bulk temperature of the dye solution was found to increase due to the heat generated by circulation pumps and non-radiative decay processes of excited dye molecules. The QYF of RhB dye in water was found to be not sensitive to temperature in the practical operating region 16–25$^\circ$C of dye laser by adopting supramolecular route to form an inclusion complex of RhB with the container molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]).</p>

					<p>We characterize thermal stability of second harmonic generation (SHG) properties of four different Y-type polymers poled using corona poling method. These polymers are based on donor–acceptor–donor-type repeating unit with different aromatic moieties acting as donors and dicyanomethylene acting as an acceptor through conjugated bridge. The donor varies from different substituted benzene to phenothiazine. Polymer containing phenothiazine as donor showed higher SHG intensity and high temperature stability due to rigid repeating unit of phenothiazine compared to others with benzene in the main chain.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The formations of sinusoidal surface relief structures recorded in positive photoresist (Allresist AR-P 3120) have been studied and optimized for different recording parameters of gratings with spatial frequency of$\tilde$1200 grooves/mm.Astable sinusoidal pattern generated using a two-beam laser interferometric technique was recorded in thin films of positive photoresist deposited on glass substrates. Several gratings were generated by varying the exposure time of interference pattern and time of chemical development of exposed media. Time duration of exposure for 90 s and chemical development for 15 s were observed to be optimum for the translation of the sinusoidal interference pattern into nearly-sinusoidal profiled grooves in the gratings for a developer AR-300-26 of dilution of 2:1 (developer:de-ionized water).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) of a probe field in a Dopplerbroadened five-level K-type atomic system driven by three strong laser (coupling) fields. Effect of wave-vector mismatch occurring when the coupling field frequency is higher than that of the probe field frequency ($\lambda_c &lt; \lambda_p$) are considered. Under the influence of the coherent coupling fields, the steady-state linear susceptibility of the probe laser shows that the system can have single, double or triple EIT windows depending on the amplitude and detuning of the coupling fields.</p>

				<title>Spectral narrowing of coherent population trapping resonance in laser-cooled and room-temperature atomic gas</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0301-0306</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated coherent population trapping (CPT) in laser-cooled as well as room-temperature (with and without buffer gas) rubidium atoms. The characteristic broad signal profile emerging from the two-photon Raman resonance for room-temperature atomic vapour is consistent with the theoretical calculation incorporating associated thermal averaging. The spectral width of the dark resonance obtained with cold atoms is found to be broadened, compared to roomtemperature vapour cell, due to the feeble role played by thermal averaging, although the cold atomic sample significantly overcomes the limitation of the transit time broadening. An alternative way to improve transit time is to use a buffer gas, with which we demonstrate that the coherent population trapping signal width is reduced to &lt; 540 Hz.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A comparative study in terms of optimized output power and stability is made on cascaded second-order nonlinear optical mode-locking with KTP, BBO and LBO crystals for both 1064 nm and 532 nm. Large nonlinear optical phase shift achieved in a non-phase-matched second harmonic generating crystal, is transformed into amplitude modulation through soft aperturing the nonlinear cavity mode variation at the laser gain medium to mode-lock a Nd:YVO$_4$ laser. The laser delivers stable dual wavelength cw mode-locked pulse train with pulse duration 10.3 ps and average power of 1.84 W and 255 mW at 1064 nm and 532 nm respectively for the optimum performance in type-II KTP crystal. The exceptional stability achieved with KTP is accounted by simulating the mode-size variation with phase mismatch.</p>

				<title>Picosecond nonlinear optical properties of cuprous oxide with different nano-morphologies</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0321-0325</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cuprous oxide nanoclusters, microcubes and microparticles were successfully synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method. Phase purity and crystallinity of the samples were studied by using X-ray powder diffraction. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show different morphologies like nanoclusters, microcubes and microparticles. For linear and nonlinear optical measurements, the as-synthesized Cu$_2$O with different morphologies were dispersed in isopropanol solution. The absorption spectrum recorded in the visible regions shows peaks that depend on the morphology of the particles and the peak shifts towards red region as one goes from nanoclusters to microparticles. Simple open-aperture Z-scan technique is used to measure nonlinear optical properties of cuprous oxide at 532 nm, 30 ps excitation at 10 Hz repetition rate. Cuprous oxide nanoclusters show reverse saturable absorption (RSA) behaviour, the microcubes and microparticles at a similar concentration exhibit saturable absorption (SA) type of behaviour at lower peak intensities and exhibit RSA within SA at higher peak intensities. The results show that the transition from SA to RSA can be ascribed to the two-photon absorption (TPA) process.</p>

				<page>0327-0330</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Research studies on quantum dots (QDs) of semiconductor materials are of potential interest in present days having promising applications in different optoelectronic devices. Among other materials, ZnS is a direct bandgap semiconductor material having a wide bandgap of 3.6 eV for its cubic phase at room temperature and it shows excellent optical properties. However, here the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of chemically synthesized ZnS QDs of average size of $\tilde$ 1.5 nm have been reported which are measured by using an indigenously developed Z-scan technique. The pump radiation is 355 nm which is the third harmonic of the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser radiation having pulsed duration of 10 ns with the repetition rate of 10 Hz. The measured experimental data have been analysed by using analytical models and two-photon absorption coefficients of the ZnS QDs at 355 nm have been extracted.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Copper complex nanoparticles were fabricated from bulk copper using picosecond laser ablation in water and chloroform. We found that composition of the nanoparticles was CuCl and Cu$_2$OCl$_2$ in chloroform at three different input fluences; Cu$_2$O in water which was confirmed from the data of EDAX, UV-Visible absorption spectra, and selected area electron diffraction pattern. We have also performed nonlinear optical studies of colloidal nanoparticles using Z-scan technique at 800 nm and $\tilde$2 ps laser pulses. Cu$_2$O NPs exhibited two-photon absorption at lower peak intensities while three-photon absorption was observed at higher peak intensities. Other samples exhibited two-photon absorption at all peak intensities.</p>

					<p>A theoretical analysis of modulational instability (MI) of optical pulses propagating near the zero dispersion wavelength of a lossless fibre with the effect of delayed saturable nonlinear response is presented.

				<abstract>
					<p>Fretting-fatigue is an important factor influencing service life of turbine blades. The present paper describes laser shock peening of potential crack nucleation site in the root region of steam turbine blade for its enhanced service life. The experimental study, performed with an in-house developed 2.5 J/7 ns Nd:YAG laser demonstrated that laser peening introduced a residual surface compressive stress of −260 to −390 MPa. Case depth of laser peened surface layer was found to be more than 900 $\mu$m.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, we report size-dependent measurement of the shift in peak of upconversion photoluminescence spectra compared to that of normal photoluminescence using a 800 nm femtosecond laser and its second harmonic. It has been shown that the upconversion photoluminescence is always red-shifted compared to that of normal PL in all the samples. By measuring the power-dependent upconversion photoluminescence (UCPL), it has been shown that the origin of UCPL from MPA-capped CdTe nanoparticles is mainly of two-photon absorption</p>

				<title>Spectral analysis of K-shell X-ray emission of magnesium plasma produced by ultrashort high-intensity laser pulse irradiation</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0365-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spectral analysis of K-shell X-ray emission of magnesium plasma, produced by laser pulses of 45 fs duration, focussed up to an intensity of $\tilde$10$^{18}$ W cm$^{−2}$, is carried out. The plasma conditions prevalent during the emission of X-ray spectrum were identified by comparing the experimental spectra with the synthetic spectra generated using the spectroscopic code Prism-SPECT. It is observed that He-like resonance line emission occurs from the plasma region having sub-critical density, whereas K-$\alpha$ emission arises from the bulk solid heated to a temperature of 10 eV by the impact of hot electrons. K-$\alpha$ line from Be-like ions was used to estimate the hot electron temperature. A power law fit to the electron temperature showed a scaling of $I^{0.47}$ with laser intensity.</p>

					<p>We have developed high sensitivity long-period fibre gratings (LPGs) in B–Ge codoped fibre for strain sensing application. These LPGs are shortest grating period (180 $\mu$m) LPGs inscribed in B–Ge co-doped fibre using CO$_2$ laser-based grating inscription set-up. Strain sensitivity of 1.77 dB/mε has been obtained for attenuation band corresponding to the turnaround point mode. TAP operation of LPG facilitates intensity-based detection using simple optical power meter instead of wavelength-based detection.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A compact trolley-mounted pulsed transverse electric atmospheric pressure (TEA) carbon dioxide laser-based differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system capable of stand-off detection of chemical clouds in aerosol and vapour form upto about 200 m range in the atmosphere has been developed and assembled at Laser Science and Technology Centre (LASTEC), Delhi. The system was tested successfully with diethyl ether (DEE) (a toxic industrial chemical (TIC)) and differential absorption signals at $\lambda_{\text{on}}$ (strong absorption, 9R16) and $\lambda_{\text{off}}$ (weak absorption, 10R26) wavelengths were recorded for stand-off distances upto $\tilde$100 m (open air ground path). This paper discusses the technical details of trolley-mounted CO$_2$ DIAL system and the data generated during the test and evaluation of this sensor using DEE aerosols.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The study on the optical characteristics of aerosol is carried out using the dual polarization lidar observations from the tropical inland station Gadanki (13.5$^\circ$N, 79.2$^\circ$E) for the period of observation during the year 2010. The summer and monsoon observation days show high scattering ratio at the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and at the lower stratosphere region. The depolarization ratio is also high at this altitude due to the transport of particulates to the TTL layer by the active convection prevailing at the period. The study reveals more dependable values of scattering ratio that are seasonal and range-dependent.</p>

				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0397-0401</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an emerging analytical technique with numerous advantages such as rapidity, multi-elemental analysis, minimal sample preparation, minimal destruction, low cost and versatility of being applied to a wide range of materials. In this paper, we report the preliminary observations we obtained using LIBS for clinical and environmental samples. Elemental analysis has been done qualitatively in human teeth samples which show encouraging results. It has also been demonstrated in this paper that LIBS can be very well utilized in field applications such as plastic waste sorting and recycling.</p>

				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0409-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work, results of upconversion emission in various powder samples have been discussed. The powder upconversion phosphors such as La$_2$O$_3$:Er$^{3+}/Yb$^{3+}$, LaF$_3$:Er$^{3+}$/Yb$^{3+}$, CeO$_2$ :Er$^{3+}$/Yb$^{3+}$, CeF$_3$:Er$^{3+}$/Yb$^{3+}$ were prepared and their upconversion emission, using 976 nm wavelength excitation, was investigated in depth. These phosphors have shown good upconversion emission in the visible region except for the CeF$_3$:Er$^{3+}$/Yb$^{3+}$ phosphor. Two intense bands around 525 and 550 nm due to the ${}^2H_{11/2}\to {}^4 I_{15/2}$ and ${}^4S_{3/2} \to {}^4 I_{15/2}$ transitions, respectively, are found to be in a thermally coupled state in these samples. The intensity ratio of these two bands permitted us to estimate the temperature of the environment. The pump power studies of the emission bands of these samples are also made to understand the dynamics of the upconversion emission.</p>

					<p>In this article, we report a method to achieve a precisely tunable highly stable probe beam generation for performing pump–probe experiment around a given wavelength by tilting a sum frequency generation (SFG) crystal angle. The width of the generated third-harmonic beam is of the order of 2 nm throughout the tunable range.

				<abstract>
					<p>We present here our experimental results on transfer of laser-cooled atom cloud to a quadrupole magnetic trap. We show that by choosing appropriately the ratio of potential energy in magnetic trap to kinetic energy of cloud in molasses, we can obtain the maximum phase-space density in the magnetic trap. These results guide us to choose the value of current to be switched in the quadrupole coils used for magnetic trapping for a given temperature of the cloud after molasses. This study is also useful to set the initial phase-space density of the cloud before evaporative cooling.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>$\textit{In-situ}$ monitoring of silver nanoparticle formation was studied in thin films of polyvinyl alcohol and silver nitrate. We proposed the observation of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a novel and simple technique to record the growth of silver nanoparticles in polyvinyl alcohol thin films. Observed enhancement in the Raman bands of polyvinyl alcohol is explained through the localized surface plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles. Influence of temperature generated by silver nanoparticles on the formation of nanoparticles is also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report the development of an optoelectronic tweezers set-up which works by lightinduced dielectrophoresis mechanism to manipulate microparticles. We used thermal evaporation technique for coating the organic polymer, titanium oxide phthalocyanine (TiOPc), as a photoconductive layer on ITO-coated glass slide. Compare to the conventional optical tweezers, the technique requires optical power in $\mu$W range and provides a manipulation area of a few mm$^2$. The set-up was used to manipulate the polystyrene microspheres and red blood cells (RBCs). The RBCs could be attracted or repelled by varying the frequency of the applied AC bias.</p>

					<p>In the present study, a digital holography microscope has been developed to study instantaneous 3D velocity field in a square channel of 1000 $\times$ 1000 $\mu$m$^2$ cross-section. The flow field is seeded with polystyrene microspheres of size $d_p = 2.1$ $\mu$m. The volumetric flow rate is set equal to 20 $\mu$l/min. The instantaneous 3D velocity field is obtained by correlating the particles obtained from the 3D numerical reconstruction of holograms using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV).</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0477-0488</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Einstein, Podolski and Rosen (EPR) have shown that any wavefunction (subject to the Schrödinger equation) can describe the physical reality completely, and any two observables associated with two non-commuting operators can have simultaneous reality. In contrast, quantum theory claims that the wavefunction can capture the physical reality completely, and the physical quantities associated with two non-commuting operators cannot have simultaneous reality. The above contradiction is known as the EPR paradox. Here, we unambiguously expose that there is a hidden assumption made by EPR, which gives rise to this famous paradox. Putting the assumption right this time leads us not to the paradox, but only reinforces the correctness of the quantum theory. However, it is shown here that the entanglement phenomenon between two physically separated particles (they were entangled prior to separation) can only be proven to exist with a `proper’ measurement.</p>

					<p>In this paper, the synchronization problem of general complex networks is investigated by using adaptive control schemes. Time-delay coupling, derivative coupling, nonlinear coupling etc. exist universally in real-world complex networks. The adaptive synchronization scheme is designed for the complex network with multiple class of coupling terms. A criterion guaranteeing synchronization of such complex networks is established by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem and adaptive control schemes. Finally, an illustrative example with numerical simulation is given to show the feasibility and efficiency of theoretical results.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0515-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Within the framework of isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model, we demonstrate the evolution of intermediate mass fragments in heavy-ion collisions. In this paper, we study the time evolution, impact parameter, and excitation energy dependence of IMF production for the different forms of density-dependent symmetry energy. The IMF production and charge distribution show a minor but considerable sensitivity towards various forms of densitydependent symmetry energy. The Coulomb interactions affect the IMF production significantly at peripheral collisions. The IMF production increases with the stiffness of symmetry energy.</p>

					<p>model is suggested to describe the fringe shift which occurs due to the phase variations of cladded glass fibre introduced between the two plates of the liquid wedge interferometer illuminated with a He–Ne laser. The fringe shift of the phase object which appears in the denominator of the Airy distribution formula of the multiple beam interference is represented in the harmonic term. An experiment is conducted using liquid wedge interferometer where the step index glass fibre of a nearly quadratic thickness variation is introduced between the two plates of the interferometer. The obtained fringe shift shows a good agreement with the proposed quadratic model. The Matlab code is written to plot the interferometer fringes comprising the shift of the step index fibre. Secondly, recognition of elliptical fibres is outlined using tomographic imaging. Finally, results and concluding remarks are given.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Crystals of cobalt tartrate are grown from the gel using chemical reaction method. The functional groups are found from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The OH stretching mode owing to water, carbonyl group, CH stretching modes and metal–oxygen stretching are identified. The unit cell dimensions, interaxial angles and unit cell volume are found from powder X-ray diffraction studies (XRD) which show the orthorhombic nature of the crystal. The magnetic study is used to find the magnetic susceptibility and magnetic moment of the grown crystal. It reveals the magnetic nature of the crystal. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are done to find the thermal properties of the crystal which manifest the water of hydration in the crystal. The variation of dielectric constant with respect to the applied frequency shows the polarization property of the crystal. The AC conductivity is increased proportionally with increase in frequency. The reverse nature is found for the AC resistivity. The nature of the composition of the crystals affects the dielectric properties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper a theoretical calculation is presented for the growth per cycle (GPC) of the film and the variation of GPC with OH concentration on the substrate surface. The calculated GPC range (0.179 nm–0.075 nm) agrees well with reported experimental values. The present approach yielded a density of 2.95 g/cc for the deposited films. The number of monolayers (ML) as a function of the OH concentration on the substrate surface is calculated and is found to be in the range of 58.4–24.2&#37; of the total number of cycles of deposition. Effective monolayer thickness is calculated as 0.31 nm.</p>

				<title>Predicting the growth of new links by new preferential attachment similarity indices</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0571-0583</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By revisiting the preferential attachment (PA) mechanism for generating a classical scale-free network, we propose a class of novel preferential attachment similarity indices for predicting future links in evolving networks. Extensive experiments on 14 real-life networks show that these new indices can provide more accurate prediction than the traditional one. Due to the improved prediction accuracy and low computational complexity, these proposed preferential attachment indices can be helpful for providing both instructions for mining unknown links and new insights to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive the network evolution.</p>

				<title>Long term performance evaluation of the TACTIC imaging telescope using $\tilde$400 h Crab Nebula observation during 2003–2010</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0585-0605</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The TeV atmospheric Cherenkov telescope with imaging camera (TACTIC) $\gamma$-ray telescope has been in operation at Mt. Abu, India since 2001 to study TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from celestial sources. During the last 10 years, apart from consistently detecting a steady signal from the Crab Nebula above $\tilde$1.2 TeV energy, at a sensitivity level of $\tilde$5.0$\sigma$ in $\tilde$25 h, the telescope has also detected flaring activity from Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 on several occasions. Although we used Crab Nebula data partially, in some of the reported results, primarily for testing the validity of the full data analysis chain, the main aim of this work is to study the long term performance of the TACTIC telescope by using consolidated data collected between 2003 and 2010. The total on-source data, comprising $\tilde$402 h, yields an excess of $\tilde$(3742$\pm$192) $\gamma$-ray events with a statistical significance of $\tilde$19.9$\sigma$ . The off-source data, comprising $\tilde$107 h of observation, is found to be consistent with a no-emission hypothesis, as expected. The resulting $\gamma$-ray rate for the onsource data is determined to be $\tilde$(9.31$\pm$0.48) h$^{−1}$. A power law fit (d$\Phi$/d$E$ = $f_0E^{−\Gamma}$) with $f_0 \tilde (2.66 \pm  0.29) \times  10^{−11}$ cm$^{−2}$ s$^{−1}$ TeV$^{−1}$ and $\Gamma \tilde$ 2.56 $\pm$ 0.10 is found to provide reasonable fit to the inferred differential spectrum within statistical uncertainties. The spectrum matches reasonably well with that obtained by other groups. A brief summary of the improvements in the various subsystems of the telescope carried out recently, which has resulted in a substantial improvement in its detection sensitivity (viz., $\tilde$5$\sigma$ in an observation period of $\tilde$13 h as compared to $\tilde$25 h earlier) are also presented in this paper. Encouraged by the detection of strong $\gamma$-ray signals from Mrk 501 and Mrk 421 on several occasions, there is considerable scope for the TACTIC telescope to monitor similar TeV $\gamma$-ray emission activity from other active galactic nuclei on a long-term basis.</p>

				<title>$S$-matrix approach to the equation of state of dilute nuclear matter</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0625-0635</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Based on the general analysis of the grand canonical partition function in the $S$-matrix framework, a method is presented to calculate the equation of state of dilute warm nuclear matter. The result is a model-independent virial series for the pressure and density that systematically includes contributions from all the ground and excited states of all the stable nuclear species and their scattering channels. The multiplicity distribution of these species to keep the matter in statistical equilibrium is found out and then the pressure, incompressibility and the symmetry energy of the system are evaluated. The calculated symmetry energy coefficients are found to be in fair agreement with the recent experimental data.</p>

				<title>The effect of nonlinearity in relativistic nucleon–nucleon potential</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0637-0647</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simple form for nucleon–nucleon (NN) potential is introduced as an alternative to the popular M3Y form using the relativistic mean field theory (RMFT) with the non-linear terms in $\sigma$ -meson for the first time. In contrast to theM3Y form, the new interaction becomes exactly zero at a finite distance and the expressions are analogous with the M3Y terms. Further, its applicability is examined by the study of proton and cluster radioactivity by folding it with the RMFT-densities of the cluster and daughter nuclei to obtain the optical potential in the region of proton-rich nuclides just above the double magic core ${}^{100}$Sn. The results obtained were found comparable with the widely used M3Y $NN$ interactions.</p>

					<p>Recently, a digital data acquisition system with 96 channels has been set up for the Indian National Gamma Array (INGA) consisting of 24 Compton-suppressed clover detectors. The digital system provides higher throughput, better energy resolution and better stability for the multidetector Compton-suppressed clover array compared to the previous conventional system with analog shaping. A number of nuclear spectroscopic experiments have been carried out using the array.

				<page>0659-0669</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The deformed configurations and rotational band structures in $N=50$ Ge and Se nuclei are studied by deformed Hartree–Fock with quadrupole constraint and angular momentum projection. Apart from the `almost’ spherical HF solution, a well-deformed configuration occurs at low excitation. A deformed well-mixed $\Omega = 1/2^+$ neutron orbit comes down in energy (from the shell above $N = 50$) to break the $N = 50$ spherical shell closure. A $K$ = 7$^−$ isomer is predicted in ${}^{84}$Se at fairly low excitation energy. At higher excitation energies (8 MeV), a deformed band with $\Omega$ = 7/2$^+$–1/2$^−$ (based on $h_{11/2}$) neutron 1p–1h excitation, for ${}^{82}$Ge and ${}^{84}$Se, is shown in our calculation. Our study gives insight into possible deformed structures at spherical shell closure.</p>

				<title>Probing of complete and incomplete fusion dynamics in heavy-ion collision</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0683-0696</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three different types of experiments have been performed to explore the complete and incomplete fusion dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. In this respect, first experiment for the measurement of excitation functions of the evaporation residues produced in the ${}^{20}$Ne+$^{165}$Ho system at projectile energy ranges $\approx$2–8 MeV/nucleon has been done. Measured cumulative and direct crosssections have been compared with the theoretical model code PACE-2, which takes into account only the complete fusion process. It has been observed that, incomplete fusion fraction is sensitively dependent on projectile energy and mass asymmetry between the projectile and the target systems. Second experiment for measuring the forward recoil range distributions of the evaporation residues produced in the ${}^{20}$Ne+$^{165}$Ho system at projectile energy $\approx$8MeV/nucleon has been done. It has been observed that, some evaporation residues have shown additional peaks in the measured forward recoil range distributions at cumulative thicknesses relatively smaller than the expected range of the residues produced via complete fusion. The results indicate the occurrence of incomplete fusion involving the breakup of ${}^{20}$Ne into ${}^4$He+$^{16}$O and/or ${}^8$Be+$^{12}$C followed by one of the fragments with target nucleus ${}^{165}$Ho. Third experiment for the measurement of spin distribution of the evaporation residues produced in the ${}^{16}$O+$^{124}$Sn system at projectile energy $\approx$6 MeV/nucleon, showed that the residues produced as incomplete fusion products associated with fast $\alpha$ and 2$\alpha$-emission channels observed in the forward cone, are found to be distinctly different from those of the residues produced as complete fusion products. The spin distribution of the evaporation residues also inferred that in incomplete fusion reaction channels input angular momentum ($J_0$) increases with fusion incompleteness when compared to complete fusion reaction channels. Present observation clearly shows that the production of fast forward $\alpha$-particles arises from relatively larger angular momentum in the entrance channel leading to peripheral collision.</p>

				<title>Cluster knockout reactions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0697-0704</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cluster knockout reactions are expected to reveal the amount of clustering (such as that of $\alpha$, d and even of heavier clusters such as ${}^{12}$C, ${}^{16}$O etc.) in the target nucleus. In simple terms, incident medium high-energy nuclear projectile interacts strongly with the cluster (present in the target nucleus) as if it were existing as a free entity. Theoretically, the relatively softer interactions of the two outgoing particles with the residual nucleus lead to optical distortions and are treated in terms of distorted wave (DW) formalism. The long-range projectile–cluster interaction is accounted for, in terms of the finite range (FR) direct reaction formalism, as against the more commonly adopted zero-range (ZR) distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA) formalism. Comparison of the DWIA calculations with the observed data provide information about the momentum distribution and the clustering spectroscopic factor of the target nucleus. Interesting results and some recent advancements in the area of ($\alpha$, 2$\alpha$) reactions and heavy cluster knockout reactions are discussed. Importance of the finite-range vertex and the final-state interactions are brought out.</p>

				<title>Decay of heavy and superheavy nuclei</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0705-0715</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here, an overview and progress of the theoretical works on the isomeric state $\alpha$ decay, $\alpha$ decay fine structure of even–even, even–odd, odd–even and odd–odd nuclei, a study on the feasibility of observing $\alpha$ decay chains from the isotopes of the superheavy nuclei $Z = 115$ in the range $271 \leq  A \leq 294$ and the isotopes of $Z = 117$ in the range $270 \leq A \leq 301$, within the Coulomb and proximity potential model for deformed nuclei (CPPMDN). The computed half-lives of the favoured and unfavoured $\alpha$ decay of nuclei in the range $67 \leq  Z \leq  91$ from both the ground state and isomeric state, are in good agreement with the experimental data and the standard deviation of half-life is found to be 0.44. From the $\alpha$ fine structure studies done on various ranges of nuclei, it is evident that, for nearly all the transitions, the theoretical values show good match with the experimental values. This reveals that CPPMDN is successful in explaining the fine structure of even–even, even–odd, odd–even and odd–odd nuclei. Our studies on the $\alpha$ decay of the superheavy nuclei ${}^{271−294}$115 and ${}^{270−301}$117 predict 4$\alpha$ chains consistently from ${}^{284,285,286}$115 nuclei and 5$\alpha$ chains and 3$\alpha$ chains consistently from ${}^{288−291}$117 and ${}^{292}$117, respectively. We thus hope that these studies on ${}^{284−286}$115 and ${}^{288−292}$117 will be a guide to future experiments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A general decay formula for the emission of charged particles from metastable nuclei is developed based on the basic phenomenon of resonances occurring in quantum scattering process under Coulomb-nuclear potential. It relates the half-lives of radioactive decays with the $Q$ values of the outgoing elements with masses and charges of the nuclei involved in the decay. The relation is found to be a generalization of the Geiger–Nuttall law in $\alpha$ radioactivity and explains well all the known emissions of charged particles including clusters, alpha and proton.</p>

				<page>0727-0741</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Study of intermediate mass fragments (IMFs) and light charged particles (LCPs) emission has been carried out for a few reactions involving $\alpha$-cluster and non-$\alpha$-cluster systems to see how the emission processes are affected by nuclear clustering. Li, Be, B and $\alpha$-particles have been studied from α-clustered system ${}^{16}$O + ${}^{12}$C for 117, 125, 145 and 160 MeV bombarding energies respectively. The enhanced yields of near-entrance channel fragment B and large quadrupole deformation of the produced composite ${}^{28}$Si$^{\ast}$ extracted from LCP spectra indicate the survival of orbiting-like process in ${}^{16}$O + ${}^{12}$C system at these energies. The same IMFs emitted from the $\alpha$-cluster system ${}^{12}$C (77 MeV) + ${}^{28}$Si and nearby non-$\alpha$ cluster ${}^{11}$B (64 MeV) + ${}^{28}$Si and ${}^{12}$C (73 MeV) + ${}^{27}$Al (all having the same excitation energy of $\tilde$67 MeV) have also been studied. The fully energy damped (fusion–fission) and the partially energy damped (deep inelastic) components of the fragment energy spectra have been extracted. It has been found that the yields of the fully energy damped fragments for all the above reactions are in conformity with the respective statistical model predictions. The time-scales of various deep inelastic fragment emissions have been extracted from the angular distribution data. The angular momentum dissipation in deep inelastic collisions has been estimated from the data and it has been found to be close to the corresponding sticking limit value.</p>

GXPF1A interaction in 1 $f_{7/2}$, 2$p_{3/2}$, 1$f_{5/2}$ and 2$p_{1/2}$ space with ${}^{40}$Ca as the core is employed.

				<title>Evolution of giant dipole resonance width at low temperatures – New perspectives</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0779-0787</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High energy photons from the decay of giant dipole resonances (GDR) built on excited states provide an excellent probe in the study of nuclear structure properties, damping mechanisms etc., at finite temperatures. The dependence of GDR width on temperature ($T$) and angular momentum ($J$) has been the prime focus of many experimental and theoretical studies for the last few decades. The measured GDR widths for a wide range of nuclei at temperatures (1.5 &lt; $T$ &lt; 2.5 MeV) and spins (upto fission limit) were well described by the thermal shape fluctuation model (TSFM). But, at low temperatures ($T$ &lt; 1.5 MeV) there are large discrepancies between the existing theoretical models. The problem is compounded as there are very few experimental data in this region. At Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata, a programme for the systematic measurement of GDR width at very low temperatures has been initiated with precise experimental techniques. Several experiments have been performed by bombarding 7–12 MeV/nucleon alpha beam on various targets (${}^{63}$Cu, ${}^{115}$In and ${}^{197}$Au) and new datasets have been obtained at low temperatures ($T$ &lt; 1.5MeV) and at very lowspins ($J$ &lt; 20$\hbar$). The TSFM completely fails to represent the experimental data at these low temperatures in the entire mass range. In fact, the GDR width appears to be constant at its ground state value until a critical temperature is reached and subsequently increases thereafter, whereas the TSFM predicts a gradual increase of GDR width from its ground state value for $T$ &gt; 0 MeV. In order to explain this discrepancy at low $T$, a new formalism has been put forward by including GDR-induced quadrupole moment in the TSFM.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Calculations of elastic scattering cross-sections for ${}^{9,10,11}^Be + ${}^{64}$Zn at near-Coulomb barrier energy have been performed using a potential obtained from the double folding model and are compared with the experiment. In the framework of the double folding model, the nuclear matter densities of ${}^{9,10,11}$Be projectiles and a ${}^{64}$Zn target are folded with the complex energydependent effective M3Y interaction. The angular distributions of the differential cross-section for ${}^{9,10}$Be scattering from ${}^{64}$Zn at $E_{c.m.} \approx$24.5 MeV agree remarkably well with the data, while in case of ${}^{11}$Be, calculations show a Coulomb–nuclear interference peak which is not observed in the data.</p>

				<title>Neutron star in the presence of strong magnetic field</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0797-0807</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Compact stars such as neutron stars (NS) can have either hadronic or exotic states like strange quark or colour superconducting matter. Stars can also have a quark core surrounded by hadronic matter, known as hybrid stars (HS). The HS is likely to have a mixed phase in between the hadron and the quark phases. Observational results suggest huge surface magnetic field in certain NS. Therefore, we study here the effect of strong magnetic field on the respective equation of states (EOS) of matter under extreme conditions. We further study the hadron–quark phase transition in the interiors of NS giving rise to HS in the presence of strong magnetic field. The hadronic matter EOS is described based on RMF theory and we include the effects of strong magnetic fields leading to Landau quantization of the charged particles. For quark phase, we use the simple Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) bag model, assuming density-dependent bag pressure and magnetic field. The magnetic field strength increases from the surface to the centre of the star. We construct the intermediate mixed phase using Glendenning conjecture. The magnetic field softens the EOS of both the matter phases. We finally study, the mass–radius relationship for such types of mixed HS, calculating their maximum mass, and compare them with the recent observations of pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which is about 2 solar mass.</p>

				<title>Effective interaction: From nuclear reactions to neutron stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0809-822</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An equation of state (EoS) for symmetric nuclear matter is constructed using the density-dependent M3Y effective interaction and extended for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. Theoretically obtained values of symmetric nuclear matter incompressibility, isobaric incompressibility, symmetry energy and its slope agree well with experimentally extracted values. Folded microscopic potentials using this effective interaction, whose density dependence is determined from nuclear matter calculations, provide excellent descriptions for proton, alpha and cluster radioactivities, elastic and inelastic scattering. The nuclear deformation parameters extracted from inelastic scattering of protons agree well with other available results. The high density behaviour of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter satisfies the constraints from the observed flow data of heavy-ion collisions. The neutron star properties studied using $\beta$-equilibrated neutron star matter obtained from this effective interaction reconcile with the recent observations of the massive compact stars.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Recent observations of high mass pulsar PSRJ1614-2230 has raised serious debate over the possible role of exotics in the dense core of neutron stars. The precise measurement of mass of the pulsar may play a very important role in limiting equation of state (EoS) of dense matter and its composition. Indirectly, it may also shape our understanding of the nucleon–hyperon or hyperon–hyperon interactions which is not well known. Within the framework of an effective chiral model, we compute models of neutron stars and analyse the hyperon composition in them. Further related implications are also discussed.</p>

					<p>The direct part of real $\alpha$−$\alpha$ interaction potential is calculated in the simple folding model using density-dependent Brink–Boeker effective interaction. The simple folding potentials calculated from the short- and finite-range components of this effective interaction are compared with their corresponding double folding results obtained from the oscillator model wave function to establish the relative accuracy of the model.

				<title>Unified approach to alpha decay calculations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0867-0878</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With the discovery of a large number of superheavy nuclei undergoing decay through $\alpha$ emissions, there has been a revival of interest in $\alpha$ decay in recent years. In the theoretical study of $\alpha$ decay the $\alpha$-nucleus potential, which is the basic input in the study of $\alpha$-nucleus systems, is also being studied using advanced theoretical methods. In the light of these, theWentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation method often used for the study of $\alpha$ decay is critically examined and its limitations are pointed out. At a given energy, the WKB expression uses barrier penetration formula for the determination of the transmission coefficient. This approach utilizes the $\alpha$-nucleus potential only at the barrier region and ignores it elsewhere. In the present era, when one has more precise experimental information on decay parameters and better understanding of $\alpha$-nucleus potential, it is desirable to use a more precise method for the calculation of decay parameters. We describe the analytic $S$-matrix (SM) method which gives a procedure for the calculation of decay energy and mean life in an integrated way by evaluating the resonance pole of the $S$-matrix in the complex momentum or energy plane. We make an illustrative comparative study of WKB and $S$-matrix methods for the determination of decay parameters in a number of superheavy nuclei.</p>

				<title>Classical simulations of heavy-ion fusion reactions and weakly-bound projectile breakup reactions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0879-0891</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heavy-ion collision simulations in various classical models are discussed. Heavy-ion reactions with spherical and deformed nuclei are simulated in a classical rigid-body dynamics (CRBD) model which takes into account the reorientation of the deformed projectile. It is found that the barrier parameters depend not only on the initial orientations of the deformed nucleus, but also on the collision energy and the moment of inertia of the deformed nucleus. Maximum reorientation effect occurs at near- and below-barrier energies for light deformed nuclei. Calculated fusion crosssections for ${}^{24}$Mg + ${}^{208}$Pb reaction are compared with a static-barrier-penetration model (SBPM) calculation to see the effect of reorientation. Heavy-ion reactions are also simulated in a 3-stage classical molecular dynamics (3S-CMD) model in which the rigid-body constraints are relaxed when the two nuclei are close to the barrier thus, taking into account all the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom in the same calculation. This model is extended to simulate heavy-ion reactions such as ${}^6$Li + ${}^{209}$Bi involving the weakly-bound projectile considered as a weakly-bound cluster of deuteron and ${}^{4}$He nuclei, thus, simulating a 3-body system in 3S-CMD model. All the essential features of breakup reactions, such as complete fusion, incomplete fusion, no-capture breakup and scattering are demonstrated.</p>

				<title>Transverse momentum spectra of the produced hadrons at SPS energy and a random walk model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0893-0905</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The transverse momentum spectra of the produced hadrons have been compared to a model, which is based on the assumption that a nucleus–nucleus collision is a superposition of isotropically decaying thermal sources at a given freeze-out temperature. The freeze-out temperature in nucleus–nucleus collisions is fixed from the inverse slope of the transverse momentum spectra of hadrons in nucleon–nucleon collision. The successive collisions in the nuclear reaction lead to gain in transverse momentum, as the nucleons propagate in the nucleus following a random walk pattern. The average transverse rapidity shift per collision is determined from the nucleon–nucleus collision data. Using this information, we obtain parameter-free result for the transverse momentum distribution of produced hadrons in nucleus–nucleus collisions. It is observed that such a model is able to explain the transverse mass spectra of the produced pions at SPS energies. However, it fails to satisfactorily explain the transverse mass spectra of kaons and protons. This indicates the presence of collective effect which cannot be accounted for, by the initial state collision broadening of transverse momentum of produced hadrons, the basis of random walk model.</p>

This model is used to calculate basic observables of nuclear multifragmentation like mass distribution, fragment multiplicity, isotopic distribution and isoscaling. Extension of canonical thermodynamical model to a projectile fragmentation model is outlined. Application of the projectile fragmentation model for calculating average number of intermediate mass fragments and the average size of the largest cluster at different $Z_{\text{bound}}$, differential charge distribution and cross-section of neutron-rich nuclei of different projectile fragmentation reactions at different energies are described.

				<title>Dynamics of light, intermediate, heavy and superheavy nuclear systems formed in heavy-ion collisions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0919-0930</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dynamical description of light, intermediate, heavy and superheavy nuclei formed in heavy-ion collisions is worked out using the dynamical cluster decay model (DCM), with reference to various effects such as deformation and orientation, temperature, angular momentum etc. Based on the quantum mechanical fragmentation theory (QMFT), DCM has been applied to understand the decay mechanism of a large number of nuclei formed in low-energy heavy-ion reactions. Various features related to the dynamics of competing decay modes of nuclear systems are explored by addressing the experimental data of a number of reactions in light, intermediate, heavy and superheavy mass regions. The DCM, being a non-statistical description for the decay of a compound nucleus, treats light particles (LPs) or equivalently evaporation residues (ERs), intermediate mass fragments (IMFs) and fission fragments on equal footing and hence, provides an alternative to the available statistical model approaches to address fusion–fission and related phenomena.</p>

				<title>Evidences for magicity in superdeformed shapes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0931-0941</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many empirical evidences that point to the existence of preferred magic nucleon numbers for superdeformed (SD) shapes are presented in this paper. We use a simple premise based on the 4-parameter formula fitted using observed $\gamma$-rays of SD bands. In particular, plots of $\gamma$-ray energy ratios, nuclear softness parameter values and the number of SD bands for given $N$ and $Z$ are used to pinpoint the magicity ($N$, $Z$ numbers) that are most favoured as the SD magic numbers. This analysis also leads to several new predictions on the occurrence of SD bands specially in neutron-rich nuclei.</p>

				<title>Effects of complex parameters on classical trajectories of Hamiltonian systems</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0973-0983</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Anderson $\textit{et al}$ have shown that for complex energies, the classical trajectories of real quartic potentials are closed and periodic only on a discrete set of eigencurves. Moreover, recently it was revealed that when time is complex $t(t = t_r e^{i\theta_\tau})$, certain real Hermitian systems possess close periodic trajectories only for a discrete set of values of $\theta_\tau$. On the other hand, it is generally true that even for real energies, classical trajectories of non-PT symmetric Hamiltonians with complex parameters are mostly non-periodic and open. In this paper, we show that for given real energy, the classical trajectories of complex quartic Hamiltonians $H = p^2 + ax^4 + bx^k$ (where $a$ is real, $b$ is complex and $k = 1$ or 2) are closed and periodic only for a discrete set of parameter curves in the complex $b$-plane. It was further found that given complex parameter $b$, the classical trajectories are periodic for a discrete set of real energies (i.e., classical energy gets discretized or quantized by imposing the condition that trajectories are periodic and closed). Moreover, we show that for real and positive energies (continuous), the classical trajectories of complex Hamiltonian $H = p^2 + \mu x^4$, ($\mu= \mu_r$ e$^{i\theta}$) are periodic when $\theta = 4 \tan^{−1}$[($n/(2m + n)$)] for $\forall n$ and $m \epsilon \mathbb{Z}$.</p>

				<title>A phenomenological approach to the equation of state of a unitary Fermi gas</title>

				<page>0985-0993</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We propose a phenomenological approach for the equation of state of a unitary Fermi gas. The universal equation of state is parametrized in terms of Fermi–Dirac integrals. This reproduces the experimental data over the accessible range of fugacity and normalized temperature, but cannot describe the superfluid phase transition found in the MIT experiment [Ku $\textit{et al, Science}$ ${\bf 335}$, 563 (2012)]. The most sensitive data for compressibility and specific heat at phase transition can, however, be fitted by introducing into the grand partition function a pair of complex conjugate zeros lying in the complex fugacity plane slightly off the real axis.</p>

				<title>Chaotic behaviour of nonlinear coupled reaction–diffusion system in four-dimensional space</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0995-1009</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, nonlinear coupled reaction–diffusion (CRD) system has been widely investigated by coupled map lattice method. Previously, nonlinear behaviour was observed dynamically when one or two of the three variables in the discrete system change. In this paper, we consider the chaotic behaviour when three variables change, which is called as four-dimensional chaos. When two parameters in the discrete system are unknown, we first give the existing condition of the chaos in four-dimensional space by the generalized definitions of spatial periodic orbits and spatial chaos. In addition, the chaotic behaviour will vary with the parameters. Then we propose a generalized Lyapunov exponent in four-dimensional space to characterize the different effects of parameters on the chaotic behaviour, which has not been studied in detail. In order to verify the chaotic behaviour of the system and the different effects clearly, we simulate the dynamical behaviour in two- and three-dimensional spaces.</p>

				<title>Extent of sensitivity of single photon production to parton distribution functions</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1039-1047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the production of single isolated prompt photons in high-energy proton–proton collisions at the RHIC ($\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV) and the LHC ($\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV) energies within the framework of perturbative QCD upto next-to-leading order of strong coupling ($\alpha_s$). We have used five different parametrizations of parton distribution function (PDF) starting from the old CTEQ4M to the new CT10 distributions and compared our results with the recent single-prompt photon data from the PHENIX and the CMS Collaborations. The prompt photon cross-section is found to be described equally well by all the PDFs within the experimental errors at the RHIC and the LHC energies. The deviation in the single-prompt photon yield for different PDF sets is within $\pm$20&#37; when compared to CTEQ4M, indicating the upper bound of uncertainty in determining the gluon density. The diphoton measurement could be a potential candidate to constrain the gluon distribution inside the proton.</p>

					<p>The operative mechanism for a free-electron laser (FEL) with two consecutive helical wigglers having opposite circular polarization in the presence of an axial magnetic field is proposed and analysed. With the help of fluid theory, a tenth-degree polynomial dispersion equation for electromagnetic and space-charge waves is derived. The results are used to illustrate and discuss the dependence of growth rate on different system parameters. Finally, it is shown that for the same system parameters the growth rate of the proposed structure is more than the growth rate of instability in a conventional FEL.</p>

					<p>Nonlinear Mach–Zehnder interferometer (NMZI) created with photonic crystal waveguides (PCW) and with Kerr-type nonlinearity has been investigated in this paper. The NMZI has been simulated using two-dimensional finite difference time domain (2D-FDTD) method. Input verses output (I/O) characteristics have been obtained for different lengths of the nonlinear arm, nonlinear coefficients of the nonlinear arm, wavelengths of the input beam, sizes of defect rods and NMZI offset. The results obtained are compared with earlier published results of NMZI created with conventional step index waveguides (SIW). It is shown that all useful features of light switching offered by SIW-based NMZIs are also possible with PCW-based NMZIs of extremely small dimensions. Moreover, PCW-based NMZIs offer additional useful feature not available with SIW-based NMZIs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the experimental studies on self-breakdown-based single-gap plasma cathode electron (PCE) gun (5–20 kV/50–160 A) in argon, gas atmosphere and its performance evaluation based on particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation code `OOPIC-Pro’.The PCE-Gun works in conducting phase (low energy, high current) of pseudospark discharge. It produces an intense electron beam, which can propagate more than 200 mm in the drift space region without external magnetic field. The profile of this beam in the drift space region at different breakdown conditions (i.e., gas pressures and applied voltages) has been studied and the experimental results are compared with simulated values. It is demonstrated that $\tilde$30&#37; beam current is lost during the propagation possibly due to space charge neutralization and collisions with neutral particles and walls.</p>

				<title>A theoretical study of pump–probe experiment in single-layer, bilayer and multilayer graphene</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1085-1101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pump–probe experiment is typically used to study relaxation phenomena in nonlinear optical systems. Here we use it as a tool to study the phenomenon of anomalous Rabi oscillations in graphene that was predicted recently in single-layer graphene. Unlike conventional Rabi oscillations, anomalous Rabi oscillations are unique to graphene (and possibly to surface states of topological insulators (TIs)), attributable to the pseudospin (conventional spin for TI) degree of freedom and Dirac-fermion character of the graphene system. A pump pulse of a finite duration long enough to contain a large number of cycles induces a current density that oscillates with the frequency of the pump pulse. The amplitude associated with these fast oscillations is seen to exhibit much slower oscillations with a frequency given by $2\omega^2_R/\omega$–the anomalous Rabi frequency, where $\omega_R$ is the conventional Rabi frequency and $\omega$ is the frequency of the external pump field. This effect is easily probed by a probe pulse subsequent to the pump, where it manifests itself as periodic oscillations of the probe susceptibility as a function of pump duration at each probe frequency. Alternatively, it is also seen as an oscillatory function of the pump–probe delay with other variables remaining fixed. This period corresponds to the anomalous Rabi frequency. An analysis of the previously reported experimental data confirms the presence of anomalous Rabi oscillations in graphene.</p>

				<title>First-principle study of nanostructures of functionalized graphene</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1103-1117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present first-principle calculations of 2D nanostructures of graphene functionalized with hydrogen and fluorine, respectively, in chair conformation. The partial density of states, band structure, binding energy and transverse displacement of C atoms due to functionalization (buckling) have been calculated within the framework of density functional theory as implemented in the SIESTA code. The variation in band gap and binding energy per add atom have been plotted against the number of add atoms, as the number of add atoms are incremented one by one. In all, 37 nanostructures with 18C atoms, $3 \times  3 \times 1$ (i.e., the unit cell is repeated three times along $x$-axis and three times along $y$-axis) supercell, have been studied. The variation in C–C, C–H and C–F bond lengths and transverse displacement of C atoms (due to increase in add atoms) have been tabulated. A large amount of buckling is observed in the carbon lattice, 0.0053–0.7487 &#197;, due to hydrogenation and 0.0002–0.5379 &#197;, due to fluorination. As the number of add atoms (hydrogen or fluorine) is increased, a variation in the band gap is observed around the Fermi energy, resulting in change in behaviour of nanostructure from conductor to semiconductor/insulator. The binding energy per add atom increases with the increase in the number of add atoms. The nanostructures with 18C+18H and 18C+18F have maximum band gap of 4.98 eV and 3.64 eV, respectively, and binding energy per add atom –3.7562 eV and –3.3507 eV, respectively. Thus, these nanostructures are stable and are wide band-gap semiconductors, whereas the nanostructures with 18C+2H, 18C+4H, 18C+4F, 18C+8F, 18C+10F and 18C+10H atoms are small band-gap semiconductors with the band gap lying between 0.14 eV and 1.72 eV. Fluorine being more electronegative than hydrogen, the impact of electronegativity on band gap, binding energy and bond length is visible. It is also clear that it is possible to tune the electronic properties of functionalized graphene, which makes it a suitable material in microelectronics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, we write the general form of the quasiexactly solvable Hamiltonian of $g_2$ algebra via one special representation in the $x–y$ two-dimensional space. Then, by choosing an appropriate set of coefficients and making a gauge rotation, we show that this Hamiltonian leads to the solvable Poschl–Teller model on an open infinite strip. Finally, we assign $g_2$ hidden algebra to the Poschl–Teller potential and obtain its spectrum by using the representation space of $g_2$ algebra.</p>

				<title>Lie and Noether symmetries of systems of complex ordinary differential equations and their split systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0009-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Lie and Noether point symmetry analyses of a $k$th-order system of $m$ complex ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with $m$ dependent variables are performed. The decomposition of complex symmetries of the given system of complex ODEs yields Lie- and Noether-like operators. The system of complex ODEs can be split into $2m$ coupled real partial differential equations (PDEs) and $2m$ Cauchy–Riemann (CR) equations. The classical approach is invoked to compute the symmetries of the $4m$ real PDEs and these are compared with the decomposed Lie- and Noetherlike operators of the system of complex ODEs. It is shown that, in general, the Lie- and Noether-like operators of the system of complex ODEs and the symmetries of the decomposed system of real PDEs are not the same. A similar analysis is carried out for restricted systems of complex ODEs that split into $2m$ coupled real ODEs. We summarize our findings on restricted complex ODEs in two propositions.</p>

					<p>In this paper, a method that can be used to construct the infinitely-many conservation laws with the Lax pair is generalized from the (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) to the (2+1)-dimensional ones. Besides, we apply that method to the Kadomtsev– Petviashvili (KP) and Davey–Stewartson equations in fluids, and respectively obtain their infinitelymany conservation laws with symbolic computation. Based on that method, we can also construct the infinitely-many conservation laws for other multidimensional NLEEs possessing the Lax pairs, including the cylindrical KP, modified KP and (2+1)-dimensional Gardner equations, in fluids, plasmas, optical fibres and Bose–Einstein condensates.</p>

				<title>Some exact solutions of magnetized viscous model in string cosmology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0063-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we study anisotropic Bianchi-V Universe with magnetic field and bulk viscous fluid in string cosmology. Exact solutions of the field equations are obtained by using the equation of state (EoS) for a cloud of strings, and a relationship between bulk viscous coefficient and scalar expansion. The bulk viscous coefficient is assumed to be inversely proportional to the expansion scalar. It is interesting to examine the effects of magnetized bulk viscous string model in early and late stages of evolution of the Universe. This paper presents different string models like geometrical (Nambu string), Takabayasi (p-string) and Reddy string models by taking certain physical conditions. We discuss the nature of classical potential for viscous fluid with and without magnetic field. The presence of bulk viscosity stops the Universe from becoming empty in its future evolution. It is observed that the Universe expands with decelerated rate in the presence of viscous fluid with magnetic field whereas, it expands with marginal inflation in the presence of viscous fluid without magnetic field. The other physical and geometrical aspects of each string model are discussed in detail.</p>

					<p>We study static spherically symmetric space-time to describe relativistic compact objects with anisotropic matter distribution and derive two classes of exact models to the Einstein–Maxwell system with a modified Van derWaals equation of state. We motivate a Van derWaals-type equation of state to physically signify a high-density domain of quark matter, and the generated exact solutions are shown to contain several classes of exact models reported previously that correspond to various physical scenarios. Geometrical analysis shows that the physical quantities are well behaved so that these models may be used to describe anisotropic charged compact spheres.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The modified multiple ($G'/G$)-expansion method is proposed in this paper to construct exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. The validity and advantage of the proposed method are illustrated by its application to the Sharma–Tasso–Olver equation. As a result, various exact solutions including hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions and their mixture with parameters are obtained. When some parameters are taken as special values, the known double solitary-like wave solutions are derived from the double hyperbolic function solution. It is shown that the method introduced in this paper has general significance in searching for exact solutions to the nonlinear evolution equations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a very efficient tool for chemical and biological sensing in nanotechnology, nanobiotechnology, medicine and environmental monitoring. A theoretical simulation study incorporating the use of admittance loci design methodology in SPR-based sensing device using gold-tungsten trioxide (Au-WO$_{3−x}$) nanocomposite film is reported in this paper. A simple Kretschmann–Raether-type prism-based plasmonic device consisting of a glass prism, Au-WO$_{3−x}$ nanocomposite film and various gas samples is considered. Complex permittivity for both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric Au-WO$_{3−x}$ nanocomposite films has been used for the simulation of the admittance loci plots, resonance curves and sensitivity curves by considering angular interrogation at a fixed wavelength of 632.8 nm.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of size of a cooling laser beam in a zig-zag atomic beam collimator on transverse cooling of a krypton atomic beam is investigated. The simulation results show that discreteness in the interaction between the cooling laser beam and atomic beam, arising due to finite size and incidence angle of the cooling laser beam, significantly reduces the value of transverse velocity capture range of the collimator. The experimental observations show the trend similar to that obtained from simulations. Our study can be particularly useful where a small zig-zag collimator is required.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, it is shown that Stieltjes electrostatic model and quantum Hamilton Jacobi formalism are analogous to each other. This analogy allows the bound state problem to mimic as $n$ unit moving imaginary charges $i\hbar$, which are placed in between the two fixed imaginary charges arising due to the classical turning points of the potential. The interaction potential between $n$ unit moving imaginary charges $i\hbar$ is given by the logarithm of the wave function. For an exactly solvable potential, this system attains stable equilibrium position at the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials depending upon the interval of the classical turning points.</p>

				<title>Linear and nonlinear resonance features of an erbium-doped fibre ring laser under cavity-loss modulation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0147-0159</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The continuous-wave output of a single-mode erbium-doped fibre ring laser when subjected to cavity-loss modulation is found to exhibit linear as well as nonlinear resonances. At sufficiently low driving amplitude, the system resembles a linear damped oscillator. At higher amplitudes, the dynamical study of these resonances shows that the behaviour of the system exhibits features of a nonlinear damped oscillator under harmonic modulation. These nonlinear dynamical features, including harmonic and subharmonic resonances, have been studied experimentally and analysed with the help of a simple time-domain and frequency-domain information obtained from the output of the laser. All the studies are restricted to the modulation frequency lying in a regime near the relaxation oscillation frequency.</p>

				<title>Nonadiabatic corrections to a quantum dot quantum computer working in adiabatic limit</title>
				<feature>Brief Report</feature>
				<page>0161-0164</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The time of operation of an adiabatic quantum computer must be less than the decoherence time, otherwise the computer would be nonoperative. So far, the nonadiabatic corrections to an adiabatic quantum computer are merely theoretical considerations. By the above reason, we consider the particular case of a quantum-dot-confined electron spin qubit working adiabatically in the nanoscale regime (e.g., in the MeV range of energies) and include nonadiabatic corrections in it. If the decoherence times of a quantum dot computer are $\tilde$100 ns [J M Kikkawa and D D Awschalom, $\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett}$. ${\bf 80}$, 4313 (1998)] then the predicted number of one qubit gate (primitive) operations of the Loss–DiVincenzo quantum computer in such an interval of time must be $&gt; 10^{10}$. However, if the quantum-dot-confined electron spin qubit is very excited (i.e., the semiclassical limit) the number of operations of such a computer would be approximately the same as that of a classical computer. Our results suggest that for an adiabatic quantum computer to operate successfully within the decoherence times, it is necessary to take into account nonadiabatic corrections.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present an analysis of a system of three two-level atoms interacting with one another through dipole–dipole interaction. The interaction manifests between the excited state of one of the atoms and the ground state of its nearest neighbour. Steady-state populations of the density matrix elements are presented and are compared with a situation when only two atoms are present. It can be noticed that the third atom modifies the behaviour of the three atoms. Two configurations are analysed, one in which the three atoms are in a line, with no interaction between atoms at the end points and the other in which the atoms form a closed loop with one atom interacting with both its neighbours.</p>

				<title>Application of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy in carbon sequestration research and development</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0179-0188</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The success of carbon capture and storage (CCS) programme relies on the long-term isolation of CO$_2$ from the atmosphere. Therefore, technologies concomitant to physical storage of CO$_2$ such as reliable measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) techniques are needed to ensure that the integrity of the storage site is maintained. We propose the use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analytical technique to detect carbon dioxide leaks to aid in the successful application of CCS. LIBS has a real-time monitoring capability and can be reliably used for the elemental and isotopic analysis of solid, liquid, and gas samples. The flexibility of probe design and use of fibre optics make it a suitable technique for real-time measurements in harsh conditions and at hard-to-reach places. Proposed monitoring with LIBS includes terrestrial soil samples, water samples from monitoring wells or from different formations, air samples from monitoring wells or suspected leakage areas. This work details the laboratory scale experiments to measure carbon contents in soil, aqueous, and air samples. The potential of the technology for measurements in high-pressure, high-temperature conditions has been discussed.</p>

The technique of Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy is briefly summarized. A review of various techniques adopted for measuring absolute frequencies of the atomic transitions and precision measurements of isotope shifts and hyperfine structures (HFS) is presented. Some of the recent works on precision measurements of HFS constants of 6$s$ ${}^2S_{1/2}$ level of ${}^{39}$K and ${}^{41}$K, 9$s$ ${}^2S_{1/2}$ level and 7$d$ ${}^2D_{3/2}$ level of ${}^{133}$Cs are also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Results illustrating the nonlinear dynamics of ultrashort laser pulse filamentation in gases are presented, with particular emphasis on the filament properties useful for developing attosecond light sources. Two aspects of ultrashort pulse filaments are specifically discussed: (i) numerical simulation results on pulse self-compression by filamentation in a gas cell filled with noble gas. Measurements of high harmonics generated by the pulse extracted from the filament allows for the detection of intensity spikes and subcycle pulses generated within the filament. (ii) Simulation results on the spontaneous formation of conical wavepackets during filamentation in gases, which in turn can be used as efficient driving pulses for the generation of high harmonics and isolated attosecond pulses.</p>

					<p>We discuss aspects of entanglement and quantum discord, two of the quantum correlations that are of much interest in the field of quantum information. Their definitions and handling will be discussed, with simple illustrative examples. A specific example is of entanglement decay resulting from a simple dissipative process and how to alter that decay. An analytical prescription for computing quantum discord when a qubit (spin-1/2 or two-level quantum system) is involved is presented along with applications, and its generalization to higher spins (many levels) indicated.</p>

				<title>Interaction of ultrashort pulses with molecules and solids: Physics and applications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0241-0253</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of ultrashort laser pulses with molecules and solids is an extremely complex area of science research encompassing the fields of physics, chemistry, and materials science. The physics of interaction has been fairly understood over the last couple of decades and, consequently, several applications have been envisaged from these interactions in the fields of photonics, lithography, biomedicine, sensing, telecommunications etc. In the present article we describe three different components of interaction of ultrashort pulses with matter: (1) with liquid molecules/thin films wherein we present the results from our studies of optical nonlinearities predominantly using picosecond and femtosecond pulses, (2) with molecules/solids wherein plasma generated from the surface was studied for applications in understanding the molecular dynamics and towards identifying high-energy molecules and (3) within the bulk and on the surface of solids (e.g. glasses, bulk polymers and metals) resulting in micro- and nanostructures. Different applications resulting from such interactions in photonics and microfluidics are presented and discussed.</p>

				<title>Role of the multipolar black-body radiation shifts in the atomic clocks at the 10$^{−18}$ uncertainty level</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0255-0263</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here an overview of the role of the multipolar black-body radiation (BBR) shifts in the single ion atomic clocks to appraise the anticipated 10$^{−18}$ uncertainty level. With an attempt to use the advanced technologies for reducing the instrumental uncertainties at the unprecedented low, it is essential to investigate contributions from the higher-order systematics to achieve the ambitious goal of securing the most precise clock frequency standard. In this context, we have analysed contributions to the BBR shifts from the multipolar polarizabilities in a few ion clocks.</p>

				<title>Multiscale simulations of damage of perfect crystal Cu at high strain rates</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0265-0272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We use the molecular dynamics code, large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS), to simulate high strain rate triaxial deformation of crystal copper to understand void nucleation and growth (NAG) within the framework of an experimentally fitted macroscopic NAG model for polycrystals (also known as DFRACT model). It is seen that void NAG at the atomistic scales for crystal copper (Cu) has the same qualitative behaviour as the DFRACT model, albeit with a different set of parameters. The effect of material temperature on the nucleation and growth of voids is studied. As the temperature increases, there is a steady decrease in the void NAG thresholds and close to the melting point of Cu, a double-dip in the pressure–time profile is observed. Analysis of this double-dip shows disappearance of the long-range order due to the creation of stacking faults and the system no longer has a face centred cubic (fcc) structure. Molecular dynamics simulation of shock in crystal Cu at strain rates high enough to cause spallation of crystal Cu are then carried out to validate the void NAG parameters. We show that the pre-history of the material affects the void nucleation threshold of the material. We also simulate high-strain-rate triaxial deformation of crystal Cu with defects and obtain void NAG parameters. The parameters are then used in a macroscale hydrodynamic simulation to obtain spallation threshold of realistic crystal Cu. It is seen that our results match experimental results within the limit of 20&#37; error.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present new types of compacton-like solutions for modified KdV and nonlinear Schrödinger equation with external sources, using a recently developed fractional transformation. In particular, we explicate these novel compactons for the trigonometric case, and compare their properties with those of the compactons and solitons in the case of modified KdV equation. Keeping in mind the significance of nonlinear Schrödinger equation with external source, for pulse propagation through asymmetric twin-core fibres, we hope that the newly found compacton may be launched in a long-haul telecommunication network utilizing asymmetric twin-core fibres.</p>

				<title>Entangling capabilities of symmetric two-qubit gates</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0279-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Our work addresses the problem of generating maximally entangled two spin-1/2 (qubit) symmetric states using NMR, NQR, Lipkin–Meshkov–Glick Hamiltonians. Time evolution of such Hamiltonians provides various logic gates which can be used for quantum processing tasks. Pairs of spin-1/2s have modelled a wide range of problems in physics. Here, we are interested in two spin-1/2 symmetric states which belong to a subspace spanned by the angular momentum basis $\{|j = 1,\mu\langle; \mu = + 1, 0, -12\}$. Our technique relies on the decomposition of a Hamiltonian in terms of $SU$(3) basis matrices. In this context, we define a set of linearly independent, traceless, Hermitian operators which provides an alternate set of $SU(n)$ generators. These matrices are constructed out of angular momentum operators $\{\bf J}_x$, ${\bf J}_y$,  ${\bf J}_z$. We construct and study the properties of perfect entanglers acting on a symmetric subspace, i.e., spin-1 operators that can generate maximally entangled states from some suitably chosen initial separable states in terms of their entangling power.</p>

				<page>0301-0316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Making use of an ansatz for the eigenfunction, we investigate closed-form solutions of the Schrödinger equation for an even power complex deictic potential and its variant in one dimension. For this purpose, extended complex phase-space approach is utilized and nature of the eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunction is determined by the analyticity property of the eigenfunction. The imaginary part of the energy eigenvalue exists only if the potential parameters are complex, whereas it reduces to zero for real coupling parameters and the result coincides with those derived from the invariance of Hamiltonian under $\mathcal{PT}$ operations. Thus, a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian possesses real eigenvalue, if it is $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric.</p>

				<title>Study of neutron-rich Mo isotopes by the projected shell model approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0341-0363</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The projected shell model (PSM) calculations have been performed for the neutron-rich even–even ${}^{102−110}$Mo and odd–even ${}^{103−109}$Mo isotopes. The present calculation reproduces the available experimental data on the yrast bands. In case of even–even nuclei, the structure of yrast bands is analysed and electromagnetic quantities are compared with the available experimental data. The $g$-factors have been predicted for high spin states. For the odd-neutron nuclei, the structures of yrast positive- and negative-parity bands are analysed and found to be in reasonable agreement with the experiments for ${}^{103−107}$Mo. The disagreement of the calculated and observed plots for energy staggering quantity clearly establishes the occurrence of sizable triaxiality in ${}^{103,105}$Mo and also predicts a decrease in the quantum of triaxiality with increasing neutron number and angular momentum for odd mass neutron-rich Mo isotopes.</p>

				<page>0365-0375</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Energy levels and $\Lambda\Lambda$ bond energy of the double-$\Lambda$ hypernucleus are calculated by considering two- and three-cluster interactions. Interactions between constituent particles are contact interactions for reproducing the low binding energy of nuclei. The effective action is constructed to involve three-body forces. In this paper, we also compare the obtained binding energy result with experimental and other cluster and shell models. The results of all schemes agree very well showing the high accuracy of our method to calculate the other many-body hyperonic nuclei using three-cluster interactions. The experimental values of $B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$(${}^{10}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$ Be) = (11.90 $\pm$ 0.13) MeV, $B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$(${}^{11}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Be) = (20.49 $\pm$ 1.15) MeV and $B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$(${}^{12}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Be) = (22.23 $\pm$ 1.15) MeV seem to be more compatible with our calculated value of $B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$(${}^{10}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Be) = 14.04 MeV, $B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$(${}^{11}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Be) = 19.31 MeV and $B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$(${}^{12}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Be) = 21.45 MeV in comparison with the other calculated results by Hiyama $\textit{et al}$, Gal $\textit{et al}$ and Guleria $\textit{et al}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This article focusses on the study of clan model parameters and their target dependence in light of void probability scaling for heavy (Ag and Br) and light (C, N and O) groups of target present in nuclear emulsion detector using ${}^{84}$Kr$_{36}$ at $\tilde$1 A GeV. The variation of scaled rapidity–gap (rap–gap) probability with single moment combination has been studied. We found that experimental points lie approximately on the negative binomial distribution (NBD) curve, indicating a scaling behaviour. The increase in average clan multiplicities ($\bar{N}$) for interactions with the pseudorapidity interval ($\Delta \eta$) was also observed. The values of $\bar{N}$ for AgBr targets are larger than those for C/N/O target and also average number of particles per clan ($\bar{n}_c$) increases with increase in pseudorapidity interval. We further observed that for a particular target, the average number of particles per clan ($\bar{n}_c$) increases with an increase in the size of projectile nucleus.</p>

					<p>We demonstrate the generation of an isotopically pure beam of laser-cooled Yb atoms by deflection using 1D-optical molasses. Atoms in a collimated thermal beam are first slowed using a Zeeman slower. They are then subjected to a pair of molasses beams inclined at 45$^\circ$ with respect to the slowed atomic beam. The slowed atoms are deflected and probed at a distance of 160 mm. We demonstrate the selective deflection of the bosonic isotope ${}^{174}$Yb and the fermionic isotope ${}^{171}$Yb. Using a transient measurement after the molasses beams are turned on, we find a longitudinal temperature of 41 mK.</p>

				<page>0395-0411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the main concerns about the currentworking on nuclear power reactors is the potential hazard of their radioactive waste. There is hope that this issue will be reduced in next generation nuclear fusion power reactors. Reactors will release nuclear energy through microexplosions that occur in a mixture of hydrogen isotopes of deuterium and tritium. However, there exist radiological hazards due to the accumulation of tritium in the blanket layer. A catalytic fusion reaction of DT$_x$ mixture may stand between DD and an equimolar DT approach in which the fusion process continues with a small amount of tritium seed. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of DT$_x$ reaction in the fast ignition (FI) scheme. The kinematic study of the main mechanism of the energy gain–loss term, which may disturb the ignition and burn process, was performed in FI and the optimum values of precompressed fuel and proton beam driver were derived. The recommended values of fuel parameters are: areal density $\rho R \geq 5$g$\cdot$cm$^{−2}$ and initial tritium fraction $x \leq 0.025$. For the proton beam, the corresponding optimum interval values are proton average energy $3\leq E_p \leq 10$ MeV, pulse duration $5 \leq t_p \leq 15$ ps and power $5\leq W_p \leq 12 \times 10^{22}$ (keV$\cdot$cm$^3$$\cdot$ps$^{−1}$). It was proved that under the above conditions, a fast ignition DT$_x$ reaction stays in the catalytic regime.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>First-principles calculations were performed to study the elastic stiffness constants ($C_{ij}$) and Debye temperature ($\theta_D$) of wurzite (wz) AlN and GaN binary semiconductors at high pressure. The lattice constants were calculated from the optimized structure of these materials. The band gaps were calculated at $\Gamma$ point using local density approximation (LDA) approach. The unit cell volume, lattice parameters, $c/a$, internal parameter ($u$), elastic constant ($C_{ij}$), Debye temperature ($\theta_D$), Hubbard parameter ($U$) and band gap ($E_g$) were studied under different pressures. The bulk modulus ($B_0$), reduced bulk modulus ($B'_0$) and Poisson ratio ($\vee$) were also calculated. The calculated values of these parameters are in fair agreement with the available experimental and reported values.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An interesting phenomenon is observed while carrying out thermal carbonization of porous silicon (PS) with an aim to arrest the natural surface degradation, and it is a burning issue for PS-based device applications. A tubular carbon structure has been observed on the PS surface. Raman, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and electron microscope studies, revealed that the tubular structure is nothing but amorphous carbon nanofibres sprouted within the pores in the absence of a metal catalyst, for which a suitable explanation is proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we investigate the effect that naturally occurring impurities in salt mines have both on effective permittivity of the medium and on radio wave propagation at $\tilde$200 MHz. The effective permittivity is determined based on the dielectric properties of salt and the characteristics of the main impurities. We conclude that at such frequencies the scattering is negligible compared to absorptions. The effect of trapped water in different forms is also evaluated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Action-at-a-distance electrodynamics – alternative approach to field theory – can be extended to cosmological models using conformal symmetry. An advantage of this is that, the origin of arrow of time in electromagnetism can be attributed to the cosmological structure. Different cosmological models can be investigated, based on Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory, and only those models can be considered viable for our Universe which have net full retarded electromagnetic interactions, i.e., forward direction of time. This work evaluates the quasi-steady-state model and demonstrates that it admits full retarded and not advanced solution. Thus, quasi-steady-state cosmology (QSSC) satisfies this necessary condition for a correct cosmological model, based on action-at-a-distance formulation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new method, homoclinic (heteroclinic) breather limit method (HBLM), for seeking rogue wave solution to nonlinear evolution equation (NEE) is proposed. (1+1)-dimensional Boussinesq equation is used as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested method. Rational homoclinic wave solution, a new family of two-wave solution, is obtained by inclined periodic homoclinic breather wave solution and is just a rogue wave solution. This result shows that rogue wave originates by the extreme behaviour of homoclinic breather wave in (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear wave fields.</p>

				<title>Biased trapping issue on weighted hierarchical networks</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0481-0491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we present trapping issues of weight-dependent walks on weighted hierarchical networks which are based on the classic scale-free hierarchical networks. Assuming that edge’s weight is used as local information by a random walker, we introduce a biased walk. The biased walk is that a walker, at each step, chooses one of its neighbours with a probability proportional to the weight of the edge. We focus on a particular case with the immobile trap positioned at the hub node which has the largest degree in the weighted hierarchical networks. Using a method based on generating functions, we determine explicitly the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for the trapping issue. Let parameter $a (0 &lt; a &lt; 1)$ be the weight factor. We show that the efficiency of the trapping process depends on the parameter a; the smaller the value of a, the more efficient is the trapping process.</p>

As the systems of our choice are capable of exhibiting vibrational resonance behaviour unlike the earlier reports, they are taken for investigation and the necessary numerical and analytical results are presented. Further, we study the effect of external forcing on various attractors of these systems with appropriate bifurcation and Lyapunov exponent diagrams.</p>

					<p>In this paper we consider a class of systems of two coupled real scalar fields in bidimensional space-time, with the main motivation of studying classical stability of soliton solutions using collective coordinate approach. First, we present the class of systems of the collective coordinate equations which are derived using the presented method. After that, we follow the dynamics of the coupled fields with local inhomogeneity like a delta function potential wall as well as a delta function potential well. The results of the investigation of the two coupled fields are compared to each other and the differences are discussed. The method can predict most of the characters of the interaction.</p>

Evolution of gap generated by the energy difference of single-particle levels $v2s_{1/2}$ and $v1d_{3/2}$ has been found to be responsible for shell closure at $N = 16$. The splitting pattern of spin–orbit partners $2p$ shell model state in Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe and Ni isotopes indicates the formation of a new shell at $N = 32$ region.</p>

					<p>The cross-sections for the formation of ${}^{54,56,57,58}$Co in the ${}^{54,56,57,58}$Fe($p, n$) reaction from threshold to 30 MeV protons have been theoretically calculated using the TALYS-1.4 nuclear model code, whereby we have studied major nuclear reaction mechanisms, including direct, preequilibrium and compound nuclear reaction. Subsequently, the level density and shell damping parameters have been adjusted and at the same time, the odd–even effects are well comprehended. The excitation functions have been compared with experimental nuclear data. It is observed that the theoretical cross-sections match fairly well. Proton-induced reaction cross-sections provide clues to understand the nuclear structure and offers a good testing ground for ideas about nuclear forces. In addition, complete information in this field is very much required for application in accelerator-driven subcritical system.</p>

				<title>Immiscible multicomponent lattice Boltzmann model for fluids with high relaxation time ratio</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0557-0570</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An immiscible multicomponent lattice Boltzmann model is developed for fluids with high relaxation time ratios, which is based on the model proposed by Shan and Chen (SC). In the SC model, an interaction potential between particles is incorporated into the discrete lattice Boltzmann equation through the equilibrium velocity. Compared to the SC model, external forces in our model are discretized directly into the discrete lattice Boltzmann equation, as proposed by Guo $\textit{et al}$. We develop it into a new multicomponent lattice Boltzmann (LB) model which has the ability to simulate immiscible multicomponent fluids with relaxation time ratio as large as 29.0 and to reduce `spurious velocity’. In this work, the improved model is validated and studied using the central bubble case and the rising bubble case. It finds good applications in both static and dynamic cases for multicomponent simulations with different relaxation time ratios.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The fine (i.e. 38 nm) powder of polycrystalline Na$_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ was prepared by the hightemperature solid-state reaction technique. The formation of the compound in orthorhombic system is confirmed by preliminary structural analysis using X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. Spectroscopic studies of the compound have been carried out by vibration spectroscopy (Raman/FTIR) to understand its molecular structure at microscopic level. The complex impedance spectroscopy (CIS) technique has been used to study the electrical properties of the material as a function of frequency (10$^2$–10$^6$ Hz) at different temperatures (23–450$^\circ$C), and also to investigate the fundamental mechanism involved in the material. Impedance analysis also indicates that below 300$^\circ$C, the electrical conduction in the material is due to grain interior only. At and above 325$^\circ$C, the contribution of grain boundary is clearly evident. The electrical processes in the material are found to be temperature-dependent and are due to the relaxation phenomena in it. A frequency-dependent maximum of the imaginary electrical impedance is found to obey the Vogel–Fulcher law.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Debye relaxation times $(\tau_{jk})$ and dipole moments $(\mu_{jk})$ of binary ($jk$) polar mixtures of ethanol (EtOH) and $N$-methyl acetamide (NMA) dissolved in benzene(i) are studied by studying conductivity of solution at 9.90 GHz for different temperatures, different mole fractions ($x_j$) of ethanol and different weight fractions $(w_{jk})$ of the mixtures, respectively. The variation of $\tau_{jk}−x_j$ from linear slope of imaginary ($\sigma''_{ijk}$) against real ($\sigma'_{ijk}$) part of total conductivity ($\sigma^{\ast}_{ijk}$) curve reveals solute–solute (dimer) or solute–solvent (monomer) molecular associations up to $x_j$ = 0.0−0.3 and thereafter, solute–solvent molecular associations. $\tau_{jk}$s from the ratio of slopes of $\sigma''_{ijk}$−w_{jk}$ and $\sigma'_{ijk}$−w_{jk}$ curves exhibit solute–solvent molecular association for all $x_j$s which are consistent with the $\mu_{jk}−x_j$ curves at all temperatures except at 35$^\circ$C. This signifies the validity of both the proposed methods in estimating $\tau$ and $\mu$. The molecular dynamics of the polar mixture are ascertained from Eyring rate theory. Theoretical dipole moments from bond angles and bond moments ($\mu_{\text{theo}}$) are also calculated to predict associational aspects.</p>

				<title>Coherent nonlinear electromagnetic response in twisted bilayer and few-layer graphene</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0597-0617</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phenomenon of Rabi oscillations far from resonance is described in bilayer and few-layer graphene. These oscillations in the population and polarization at the Dirac point in $n$-layer graphene are seen in the nth harmonic termin the external driving frequency. The underlying reason behind these oscillations is attributable to the pseudospin degree of freedom possessed by all these systems. Conventional Rabi oscillations, which occur only near resonance, are seen in multiple harmonics in multilayer graphene. However, the experimentally measurable current density exhibits anomalous behaviour only in the first harmonic in all the graphene systems. A fully numerical solution of the optical Bloch equations is in complete agreement with the analytical results, thereby justifying the approximation schemes used in the latter. The same phenomena are also described in twisted bilayer graphene with and without an electric potential difference between the layers. It is found that the anomalous Rabi frequency is strongly dependent on twist angle for weak applied fields – a feature absent in single-layer graphene, whereas the conventional Rabi frequency is relatively independent of the twist angle.</p>

				<page>0635-0642</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nucleus ${}^8$Be has been conjectured to resemble a molecule of two interacting $\alpha$-particles. A crucial test of this conjecture is the electromagnetic transition between the molecular resonances. This paper discusses the earlier indirect bremsstrahlung measurements and describes a recent experiment on the direct measurement of $\gamma$-transition between the $4^+$ and $2^+$ resonances. Experimental results are compared with various theories. The outlook on the measurement of $2^+ \to 0^+$ transition will be presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The nucleus ${}^{12}$C has a rather significant role in modern nuclear physics, but whose influence can be traced to the work of Hoyle in the 1950s, when it was concluded that there should be a state close to 7.68 MeV responsible for the synthesis of carbon in stellar nucleosynthesis. Although a state at 7.65 MeV was subsequently discovered, its properties have remained something of a mystery until rather recently. This paper explores our current understanding of the structure of ${}^{12}$C, in particular the nature of the Hoyle state.</p>

					<p>We review the calculation of the Hoyle state of ${}^{12}$C in nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) and its anthropic implications in the nucleosynthesis of ${}^{12}$C and ${}^{16}$O in red giant stars. We also analyse the extension of NLEFT to the regime of medium-mass nuclei, with emphasis on the determination of the ground-state energies of the $\alpha$ nuclei ${}^{16}$O, ${}^{20}$Ne, ${}^{24}$Mg, and ${}^{28}$Si by Euclidean time projection. Finally, we discuss recent NLEFT results for the spectrum, electromagnetic properties, and α-cluster structure of ${}^{16}$O.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the recent work our group has undertaken on effective field theory (EFT) analyses of experimental data pertaining to one- and two-neutron halo nuclei is discussed. The cases of ${}^{19}$C and ${}^8$Li (one-neutron halos) and ${}^{22}$C (two-neutron halo) are considered. For ${}^{19}$C and ${}^8$Li electromagnetic processes, such as Coulomb dissociation and radiative capture are considered. In the ${}^{22}$C system the way in which the measured matter radius can be used to derive constraints on the two-neutron separation energy of this very neutron-rich system is shown. In each case the Halo EFT’s ability to correlate different experimental observables with one another, in a modelindependent manner, and up to an accuracy that is determined by the separation of scales in the halo system is shown.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The prediction of Hoyle state was necessitated to explain the abundance of carbon, which is crucial for the existence of life on Earth and is the stepping stone for understanding the abundance of other heavier elements. After the experimental confirmation of its existence, soon it was realized that the Hoyle state was `different’ from other excited states of carbon, which led to intense theoretical and experimental activities over the past few decades to understand its structure. In recent times, precision, high statistics experiments on the decay of Hoyle state have been performed at the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, to determine the quantitative contributions of various direct $3\alpha$ decay mechanisms of the Hoyle state. The present results have been critically compared with those obtained in other recent experiments and their implications have been discussed.</p>

				<title>Viscosity: From air to hot nuclei</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0683-0693</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>After a brief review of the history of viscosity from classical to quantal fluids, a discussion of how the shear viscosity $\eta$ of a finite hot nucleus is calculated directly from the width and energy of the giant dipole resonance (GDR) of the nucleus is given in this paper. The ratio $\eta/s$ with s being the entropy volume density, is extracted from the experimental systematic of GDR in copper, tin and lead isotopes at finite temperature $T$. These empirical results are compared with the results predicted by several independent models, as well as with almost model-independent estimations. Based on these results, it is concluded that the ratio $\eta/s$ in medium and heavy nuclei decreases with increasing $T$ to reach (1.3−4)$\times\hbar/(4\pi k_B)$ at $T = 5$ MeV, which is almost the same as that obtained for quark-gluon plasma at $T &gt; 170$ MeV.</p>

				<title>Net-proton measurements at RHIC and the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0705-0712</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two measurements related to the proton and antiproton production near midrapidity in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV Au+Au collisions using the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are discussed. At intermediate impact parameters, the net-proton midrapidity d$v_1$/d$y$, where $v_1$ and $y$ are directed flow and rapidity, respectively, shows non-monotonic variation as a function of beam energy. This non-monotonic variation is characterized by the presence of a minimum in d$v_1$/d$y$ between $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 11.5 and 19.6 GeV and a change in the sign of d$v_1$/d$y$ twice between $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 and 39 GeV. At small impact parameters the product of the moments of net-proton distribution, kurtosis $\times$ variance ($\kappa \sigma^2$) and skewness $\times$ standard deviation ($S\sigma$) are observed to be significantly below the corresponding measurements at large impact parameter collisions for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6 and 27 GeV. The $\kappa \sigma^2$ and $S\sigma$ values at these beam energies deviate from the expectations from Poisson statistics and that from a hadron resonance gas model. Both these measurements have implications towards understanding the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase structures, the first-order phase transition and the critical point in the high baryonic chemical potential region of the phase diagram.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An experimental campaign aimed at studying various high spin phenomena using the Indian National Gamma Array (INGA) at the BARC–TIFR Pelletron Linac Facility has been successfully completed. The array consisting of a large number of Compton-suppressed clover detectors was coupled to a digital data acquisition system with 96 channels. The present system provides higher throughput, better energy resolution and better stability of gain for the multidetector Compton-suppressed clover array compared to its previous conventional system with analog shaping. Selected results from this array are discussed which highlight the exotic shapes, novel excitation modes and interesting isomers of the nuclei. The preliminary results from the experimental efforts to improve the sensitivity and capability of the array by adding ancillary detectors are also described briefly.</p>

				<title>Nuclear triaxiality in the $A \tilde$ 160–170 mass region: the story so far</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0729-0737</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Research in nuclear triaxial deformation has revealed many exciting facts and figures over the last one and a half-decades. Although wobbling motion of nuclei was experimentally discovered at the beginning of the last decade, after almost 25 years of its prediction by Bohr and Mottelson, efforts are still being put to understand this rare nuclear phenomenon in greater detail. The concept of transverse wobbling is one such recent attempt which successfully explains the evolution of experimentally observed wobbling frequency with spin. The population of triaxial strongly deformed (TSD) bands in the $A \tilde$160–170 region is favoured for which neutron number ($N = 92$ or 94) is a topic of current debate. Experimental efforts are being put following Bengtsson’s calculations which indicate that the elevated yrast lines for $N = 92$ isotones favour TSD population. In $A\tilde$170 mass region, the ambiguity over the real character of certain strongly deformed bands has recently been removed by extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, and the bands have now been firmly established as either enhanced deformed (ED) or superdeformed (SD).</p>

				<title>Role of near threshold resonances in intermediate energy nuclear physics</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0749-0759</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The presence of a resonance close to the threshold strongly effects the dynamics of the interacting particles at low energies. Production of ${}^{12}$C, the element for life, in ${}^4$He burning in Sun is a classic example of such a situation. In intermediate energy nuclear physics, this situation arises in the interactions of an $\eta$-meson with a nucleon and that of a $K^−$-meson with a proton at low energies, where both these systems have a resonance or a bound state near their thresholds, resulting in a strong attractive interaction. If putting these mesons in nuclear environment produces a strong attraction, it is possible that, in nature there may exist $\eta$- and $K^−$-nuclear bound states. Such a tantalizing possibility has led to experimental and theoretical programmes to search for them. These efforts have produced positive results. This paper gives a brief critical overview of these studies, emphasizing especially the efforts led by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC).</p>

				<title>Opportunities and problems in determining proton and light nuclear radii</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0761-0771</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We briefly review the so-called `proton puzzle’, i.e., the disagreement of the newly extracted value of the proton charge radius $r_p$ from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy with other extractions, its possible significance and related problems. After describing the conventional theory to extract the proton radius from atomic spectroscopy we focus on a novel consistent approach based on the Breit equation. With this new tool, we confirm that the radius has indeed become smaller compared to the value extracted from scattering experiments, but the existence of different theoretical approaches casts some doubt on the accuracy of the new value. Precision measurements in atomic physics do provide the opportunity to extract light nuclear radii but the accuracy is limited by the methods of incorporating the nuclear structure effects.</p>

				<title>Heavy flavour hadron spectroscopy: An overview</title>

				<page>0773-0782</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive overview and some of the theoretical attempts towards understanding heavy flavour hadron spectroscopy are presented. Apart from the conventional quark structure (quark, antiquarks structure for the mesons and three-quarks structure of baryons) of hadrons, multiquark hadrons the hadron molecular states etc., also will be reviewed. Various issues and challenges in understanding the physics and dynamics of the quarks at the hadronic dimensions are highlighted. Looking into the present and future experimental prospects at different heavy flavour laboratories like BES-III, CLEO-c, BaBar, Belle, LHC etc., the scope for theoretical extensions of the present knowledge of heavy flavour physics would be very demanding. In this context, many relevant contributions from the forthcoming PANDA Facility are expected. Scopes and outlook of the hadron physics at the heavy flavour sector in view of the future experimental facilities are highlighted.</p>

We present the results of a systematic leading-order calculation of hyperon Compton scattering and extract the forward spin polarizability ($\gamma$0) of hyperons. The results obtained for $\gamma_0$ in the case of nucleons agree with the known results of $SU$(2) HBChPT when kaon loops are not considered.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Heavy ion reaction studies around Coulomb barrier energies have been generally used to investigate the effect of the structure of projectile/target on reaction dynamics. Other than providing an understanding of basic physics of the reaction dynamics, some of these reactions have been used as tools to serve as surrogates of neutron-induced compound nuclear fission cross-sections involving unstable targets. In this paper, we report some of the recent results on the determination of neutron-induced fission cross-sections of unstable actinides present in Th–U and U–Pu fuel cycles by surrogate reaction method by employing transfer-induced fission studies with ${}^{6,7}$Li beams.</p>

				<page>0807-0815</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The characteristics and performance of the newly commissioned neutron detector array at IUAC are described. The array consists of 100 BC501 liquid scintillators mounted in a semispherical geometry and are kept at a distance of 175 cm from the reaction point. Each detector is a $5''\times 5''$ cylindrical cell coupled to $5''$ diameter photomultiplier tube (PMT). Signal processing is realized using custom-designed home-made integrated electronic modules which perform neutron–gamma discrimination using zero cross timing and time-of-flight (TOF) technique. Compact custom-built high voltage power supply developed using DC–DC converters are used to bias the detector. The neutrons are recorded in coincidence with fission fragments which are detected using multi-wire proportional counters mounted inside a 1m diameter SS target chamber. The detectors and electronics have been tested off-line using radioactive sources and the results are presented.</p>

In this paper, a simplistic view has been presented on the application of our formalism to composite detectors consisting of hexagonal closely packed encapsulated HPGe detector modules.We have presented modified calculations for the peak-to-total (PT) and peak-to-background (PB) ratios of the cluster and spectrometer for integral satellite (SPI) for the first time considering up to four-fold events. Instead of using an empirical method or simulation, we present a novel approach for calculating the peak-to-total ratio of the SPI spectrometer for high $\gamma$ energies. Our work can provide guidance for designing new composite detectors and for performing experimental studies with the SPI spectrometer for high-energy $\gamma$-rays.</p>

				<title>Charged particle-induced nuclear fission reactions – Progress and prospects</title>
				<feature>Invited Review</feature>
				<page>0851-0884</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nuclear fission phenomenon continues to be an enigma, even after nearly 75 years of its discovery. Considerable progress has been made towards understanding the fission process. Both light projectiles and heavy ions have been employed to investigate nuclear fission. An extensive database of the properties of fissionable nuclei has been generated. The theoretical developments to describe the fission phenomenon have kept pace with the progress in the corresponding experimental measurements. As the fission process initiated by the neutrons has been well documented, the present article will be restricted to charged particle-induced fission reactions. The progress made in recent years and the prospects in the area of nuclear fission research will be the focus of this review.</p>

				<page>0885-0906</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, we study time–space fractional advection–dispersion (FADE) equation and time–space fractional Whitham–Broer–Kaup (FWBK) equation that have significant roles in hydrology. We introduce suitable transformations to convert fractional-order derivatives to integerorder derivatives and as a result these equations transform into partial differential equations (PDEs). Then the Lie symmetries and the corresponding optimal systems of the resulting PDEs are derived. The symmetry reductions and exact independent solutions based on optimal system are investigated which constitute the exact solutions of original fractional differential equations.</p>

				<title>Two atoms scattering at low and cold energies</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0907-0914</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A modified static-exchange model is developed to study the collision of an atom with another atom. It includes the effect of long-range dipole–dipole van der Waals interaction between two atoms in addition to the exact effect of short-range force due to Coulomb exchange between two system electrons. Both these interactions dominate at colder energies. The system is treated as a four-centre problem in the centre-of-mass frame. The present $\textit{ab-initio}$ model is useful to study the two-atomic collisions at low energies, as well as cold energies. The new code is applied to study the scattering of positronium (Ps) by hydrogen (H), both in their ground states.</p>

				<title>Spin–spin entanglement in moving frames: Properties of negativity</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0915-0923</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present article, we use negativity to investigate the entanglement between two massive particles in the spin degrees of freedom, as seen by moving observers. Assuming that the occurrence of spin-momentum states is determined by Gaussian probability distributions, we show that the degree of entanglement monotonically descends to a diminishingly small value at high rapidities. We further report, how the characteristics of this behaviour vary as the widths of distributions change. In particular, the degree of maximally entangled spin–spin states, resulting from equal distribution widths, is shown to exhibit extrema, depending on the width, at certain rapidities. The material presented in this paper then supports the idea that, for relativistic particles, a consistent reduced spin density (from which the negativity is derived) is impossible to construct.</p>

					<p>We study the well-known one-dimensional problem of $N$ particles with nonlinear interaction. The $\beta$-Fermi–Pasta–Ulam model is the special case of quadratic and quartic interaction potential among nearest neighbours. We enumerate and classify the simple periodic orbits for this system and find the stability zones, employing Floquet theory. We quantize the nonlinear normal modes and construct a wavefunction for what we believe is a primitive nonlinear analogue of a `phonon’.</p>

				<title>Dependence of synchronization frequency of Kuramoto oscillators on symmetry of intrinsic frequency in ring network</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0945-0953</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kuramoto oscillators have been proposed earlier as a model for interacting systems that exhibit synchronization. In this article, we study the difference between networks with symmetric and asymmetric distribution of natural frequencies. We first indicate that synchronization frequency of oscillators in a completely connected network is always equal to the mean of the natural frequency distribution. In particular, shape of the natural frequency distribution does not affect the synchronization frequency in this case. Then, we analyse the case of oscillators in a directed ring network, where asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution is seen to shift the synchronization frequency of the network. We also present an estimate of the shift in the frequencies for slightly asymmetric distributions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Author uses the condition in terms of contact point radial distribution function $G(\sigma, \lambda(\eta_c, \alpha))$ containing the self-consistent function $\lambda(\eta_c, \alpha)$ and condition of continuity at $\sigma/2$ = contact point, to determine equation of state, (EoS). Different EoSs in terms of built-in parameter, $m$, can be obtained with a suitable choice of $\lambda(\eta_c, \alpha)$ and the present EoSs have less r.m.s. deviation than Barker–Henderson BH2 for LJ fluids, and results are much closer to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations than expectations and reproduce the existing simulation data and present EoS for LJ potential, with the help of a set of minimum single-scaled parameter, $a_0(\eta_c, \alpha)$ for a given reduced temperature, $T^\ast = (1/\beta \epsilon)$= 1.4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. It has been found that parameter $\alpha$ = 1.059128388 can be used to fix up the critical temperature parameter $T_c$ = 1.3120(7) to that of a computer simulation result.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, we uphold and extend the formalism advocated by us more than a decade ago in order to extract information on various distribution functions describing nucleonic helicity structure and calculate a complete set of splitting functions relevant for their quantum chromodynamics (QCD) evolutions using light-front Hamiltonian perturbation theory in light front gauge $A^+$ = 0. Twist-two structures of the helicity distributions are self-evident in our calculation. Sum rules associated with these helicity distributions are also verified in a frame-independent way.</p>

				<title>Measurement of nonlinear refractive index in open-aperture $Z$-scan experiments</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0985-0994</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present an experimental study on measurement of nonlinear refractive index ($n_2$) of organic liquids when the thermo-optic effects manifest into large nonlinear phase shifts ($\Delta\phi_0$) in an open-aperture $Z$-scan configuration. Although we do not obtain the familiar peak–valley normalized transmittance curve as in the case of closed-aperture $Z$-scan technique, we use a theoretical model using Gaussian beam decomposition (GD) technique to estimate the value of $n_2$. Using this recipe, we obtain the nonlinear refractive index $n_2 = −(4.90 \pm 1.20) \times 10^{−15}$ cm$^2$/W for toluene (organic solvent) and $n_2 = −(10.60 \pm  2.10) \times  10^{−15}$ cm$^2$/W for an organic polymer solution (10$^{−4}$ Min toluene). By carrying out absorption measurements directly with an unfocussed Gaussian beam, we found nonlinear absorptions $\beta_{\text{tol}} = (2.42 \pm 0.20) \times 10^{−13}$ m/W and $\beta_{\text{poly}} = (2.79 \pm 0.24) \times  10^{−13}$ m/W which are close to the expected results.</p>

				<title>Beam filter and splitter based on surface plasmon propagation in ring metal heterowaveguide</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0995-1002</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) beam filter (BF) and beam splitter (BS) constructed using metal heterostructures are proposed and demonstrated numerically. Both structures have a ring metal heterowaveguide, which is constructed by a metal cylinder and a ring dielectric cladding. The two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (2D-FDTD) method is employed to study the properties of the proposed BF and BS, and the results show that SPPs can effectively propagate on bended plasmonic waveguides with dielectric claddings. By introducing dielectric and plasmonic waveguides on both sides of the resonant ring, SPPs can be efficiently excited at the output of the waveguide ring resonator (WRR) through mode coupling. The planar metal heterostructures provide a way for constructing various nanoscale counterparts of conventional planar integrated devices such as filters, splitters, resonators, sensors, optical switches, and so on.</p>

				<page>1003-1013</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we studied the propagation of elastic longitudinal waves in quasi-onedimensional (1D) finite phononic crystal with conical section, and derived expressions of frequencyresponse functions. It is found that, contrary to the 1D phononic crystal with a constant section, the value of attenuation inside the band gaps decreases quickly when cross-sectional area increases, and the initial frequency also decreases, but the cut-off frequency increases, thus the width of the band gap increases. The effects of lattice constant and the filling fraction on the band gap are also analysed, and the change trends of the initial frequency and cut-off frequency are consistent with those of constant section. It is shown that the results using this method are in good agreement with the results analysed by the finite element software, ANSYS.We hope that the results will be helpful in practical applications of phononic crystals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A theoretical investigation has been carried out on the growth rate of instability of the low-frequency electrostatic waves in a partially ionized four-component magnetodustyplasma in the presence of polarization force. Utilizing the method of linear mode analysis, the results of investigation have been presented. The findings of the investigation reveal that the polarization force, the external magnetic field and the dust temperature have a tendency to destabilize the system by increasing the growth rate of instability. On the other hand, the positive dust mass causes the instability growth rate to decrease, thereby stabilizing the system.</p>

				<title>Plasmonic properties of gold-coated nanoporous anodic alumina with linearly organized pores</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Anodization of aluminium surfaces containing linearly oriented scratches leads to the formation of nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) with the nanopores arranged preferentially along the scratch marks. NAA, when coated with a thin gold film, support plasmonic resonances. Dark-field spectroscopy revealed that gold-coated NAA with such linearly arranged pores shows a polarization-dependent scattering, that is larger when the incident light is polarized parallel to the scratch direction than when polarized perpendicular to the scratch direction. Fluorescence studies from rhodamine-6G (R6G) molecules dissolved in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and deposited on these NAA templates showed that fluorescence can be strongly enhanced with the bare NAA due to multiple light scattering in the NAA, while fluorescence from the molecules deposited on gold-coated NAA is strongly quenched due to the strong plasmonic coupling.</p>
