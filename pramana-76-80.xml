				<title>Results from PAMELA, ATIC and FERMI: Pulsars or dark matter?</title>
				<feature>Topical Review</feature>
				<page>0001-0022</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well known that dark matter dominates the dynamics of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Its constituents remain a mystery despite an assiduous search for them over the past three decades. Recent results from the satellite-based PAMELA experiment show an excess in the positron fraction at energies between 10 and 100 GeV in the secondary cosmic ray spectrum. Other experiments, namely ATIC, HESS and FERMI, show an excess in the total electron $(e^+ + e^−)$ spectrum for energies greater than 100 GeV. These excesses in the positron fraction as well as the electron spectrum can arise in local astrophysical processes like pulsars, or can be attributed to the annihilation of the dark matter particles. The latter possibility gives clues to the possible candidates for the dark matter in galaxies and other astrophysical systems. In this article, we give a report of these exciting developments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Three-dimensional non-Hermitian systems are investigated using classical perturbation theory based on Lie transformations. Analytic expressions for total energy in terms of action variables are derived. Both real and complex semiclassical eigenvalues are obtained by quantizing the action variables. It was found that semiclassical energy eigenvalues calculated with the classical perturbation theory are in very good agreement with exact energies and for certain non-Hermitian systems second-order classical perturbation theory performed better than the secondorder Rayleigh–Schroedinger perturbation theory.</p>

				<title>Iterative approach for the eigenvalue problems</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0047-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An approximation method based on the iterative technique is developed within the framework of linear delta expansion (LDE) technique for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional and three-dimensional realistic physical problems. This technique allows us to obtain the coefficient in the perturbation series for the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues directly by knowing the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of the unperturbed problems in quantum mechanics. Examples are presented to support this. Hence, the LDE technique can be used for non-perturbative as well as perturbative systems to find approximate solutions of eigenvalue problems.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear quantum mechanics, the superposition principle, and the quantum measurement problem</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0067-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There are four reasons why our present knowledge and understanding of quantum mechanics can be regarded as incomplete. (1) The principle of linear superposition has not been experimentally tested for position eigenstates of objects having more than about a thousand atoms. (2) There is no universally agreed upon explanation for the process of quantum measurement. (3) There is no universally agreed upon explanation for the observed fact that macroscopic objects are not found in superposition of position eigenstates. (4) Most importantly, the concept of time is classical and hence external to quantum mechanics: there should exist an equivalent reformulation of the theory which does not refer to an external classical time. In this paper we argue that such a reformulation is the limiting case of a nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming important at the Planck mass scale. Such a nonlinearity can provide insights into the aforesaid problems. We use a physically motivated model for a nonlinear Schr ¨odinger equation to show that nonlinearity can help in understanding quantum measurement. We also show that while the principle of linear superposition holds to a very high accuracy for atomic systems, the lifetime of a quantum superposition becomes progressively smaller, as one goes from microscopic to macroscopic objects. This can explain the observed absence of position superpositions in macroscopic objects (lifetime is too small). It also suggests that ongoing laboratory experiments may be able to detect the ﬁnite superposition lifetime for mesoscopic objects in the near future.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The hadronic events from the $e^+ e^−$ annihilation data at the centre-of-mass energies ranging from 60 to 197 GeV were studied. The AMY and OPAL Collaborations offered a unique opportunity to test QCD by measuring the energy dependence of different observables. The coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, was measured by two different methods: first by employing the three-jet observables. Combining all the data, the value of as at next-to-next leading order (NNLO) was determined to be $0.117 \pm 0.004$(hard) $\pm$ 0.006$(theo). Secondly, from the event-shape distributions, the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, was extracted at NNLO and it’s evaluation was tested with the energy scale. The results were consistent with the running of $\alpha_s$, expected from QCD predictions. Averaging over different observables, $\alpha_s$ was determined to be $0.115 \pm 0.007$(hard) $\pm 0.003$(theo).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>By using noninteger n-Slater type orbitals in combined Hartree–Fock–Roothaan method, self-consistent ﬁeld calculations of orbital and lowest states energies have been performed for the isoelectronic series of open shell systems $K[Ar]4s^0 3d^1 ({}^2D) (Z = 19–30)$ and $Cr^+[Ar]4s^0 3d^5 ({}^6 S) (Z = 24–30)$. The results of the calculations for the orbital and total energies obtained by using minimal basis-sets of noninteger $n$-Slater type orbitals are given in the tables. The results are compared with the extended-basis Hartree–Fock computations. The orbital and total energies are in good agreement with those presented in the literature. The results can be useful in the study of various properties of heavy atomic systems when the combined Hartree–Fock–Roothaan approach is employed.</p>

We have shown experimentally that the optimum value of the laser-diode temperature for the maximum pump power absorption by the Nd:YVO$_4$ crystal and the maximum Nd:YVO$_4$ laser output power are approximately similar to that of a system of the low power type, but by increasing the pump power, different values can be obtained.</p>

				<title>Atomistic simulation of the point defects in TaW ordered alloy</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0127-0138</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with modified analytic embeddedatom method (MAEAM), the formation, migration and activation energies of the point defects for six-kind migration mechanisms in B$_2$-type TaW alloy have been investigated. The results showed that the anti-site defects TaW and W$_{\text{Ta}}$ were easier to form than Ta and W vacancies owing to their lower formation energies. Comparing the migration and activation energies needed for six-kind migration mechanisms of a Ta (or W) vacancy, we found that one nearest-neighbour jump (1NNJ) was the most favourable because of its lowest migration and activation energies, but it would lead to a disorder in the alloy. One next-nearest-neighbour jump (1NNNJ) and one third-nearest-neighbour jump (1TNNJ) could maintain the ordered property of the alloy but required higher migration and activation energies. So the 1NNNJ and 1TNNJ should be replaced by straight [100] six nearestneighbor cyclic jumps (S[100]6NNCJ) (especially) or bent [100] six nearest-neighbour cyclic jumps (B[100]6NNCJ) and [110] six nearest-neighbor cyclic jumps ([110]6NNCJ), respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thin films of zinc oxide (ZnO) were deposited on cleaned glass substrates by chemical spray pyrolysis technique using Zn(CH$_3$COO)$_2$ as precursor solution. Also, aluminium-doped thin films of ZnO were prepared by using AlCl$_3$ as doping solution for aluminium. The dopant concentration [Al/Zn atomic percentage (at&#37;)] was varied from 0 to 1.5 at&#37; in thin films of ZnO prepared in different depositions. Structural characterization of the deposited films was performed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. It confirmed that all the films were of zinc oxide having polycrystalline nature and possessing typical hexagonal wurtzite structure with crystallite size varying between 100.7 and 268.6 nm. The films exhibited changes in relative intensities and crystallite size with changes in the doping concentration of Al. The electrical studies established that 1 at&#37; of Aldoping was the optimum for enhancing electrical conduction in ZnO thin films and beyond that the distortion caused in the lattice lowered the conductivity. The films also exhibited distinct changes in their optical properties at different doping concentrations, including a blue shift and slight widening of bandgap with increasing Al dopant concentration.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Interfacial characteristics of metal oxide-silicon carbide (MOSiC) structure with different thickness of SiO$_2$, thermally grown in steam ambient on Si-face of 4H-SiC ($0 0 0 1$) substrate were investigated. Variations in interface trapped level density ($D_{\text{it}}$) was systematically studied employing high-low (H-L) frequency $C–V$ method. It was found that the distribution of $D_{\text{it}}$ within the bandgap of 4H-SiC varied with oxide thickness. The calculated $D_{\text{it}}$ value near the midgap of 4H-SiC remained almost stable for all oxide thicknesses in the range of $10^9 –10^{10}$ cm$^{−2}$ eV$^{−1}$. The $D_{\text{it}}$ near the conduction band edge had been found to be of the order of $10^{11}$ cm$^{−2}$ eV$^{−1}$ for thicker oxides and for thinner oxides $D_{\text{it}}$ was found to be the range of $10^{10}$ cm$^{−2}$ eV$^{−1}$. The process had direct relevance in the fabrication of MOS-based device structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Primordial black holes evaporate due to Hawking radiation. We find that the evaporation times of primordial black holes increase when accretion of radiation is included. Thus, depending on accretion efficiency, more primordial black holes are existing today, which strengthens the conjecture that the primordial black holes are the proper candidates for dark matter.</p>

				<title>Thermoelastic properties of minerals at high temperature</title>
				<feature>Brief Report</feature>
				<page>0183-0188</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The knowledge of elasticity of the minerals is useful for interpreting the structure and composition of the lower mantle and also in seismic studies. The purpose of the present study is to discuss a simple and straightforward method for evaluating thermoelastic properties of minerals at high temperatures. We have extended the Kumar’s formulation by taking into the account the concept of anharmonicity in minerals above the Debye temperature ($\theta_D$). In our present study, we have investigated the thermophysical properties of two minerals (pyrope-rich garnet and MgAl$_2$O$_4$) under high temperatures and calculated the second-order elastic constant ($C_{ij}$) and bulk modulus ($K_T$) of the above minerals, in two cases ﬁrst by taking Anderson–Gruneisen parameter ($\delta_T$) as temperature-independent and then by treating $\delta_T$ as temperature-dependent parameter. The results obtained when $\delta_T$ is temperature-dependent are in close agreement with experimental data.</p>

				<title>X-ray spectrometry for preventive conservation of cultural heritage</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0191-0200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analytical chemistry does play a key role in the chemical characterization of the environment and it appears that X-ray spectrometry, in its many forms, is one of the most relevant analytical techniques in preventive conservation, as it is in cultural heritage research in general. X-ray spectrometry has indeed been the method of choice for the characterization of the inorganic composition of atmospheric aerosols, for a long time.</p>
					<p>We have, over the last decade, intensively used various forms of X-ray spectrometry, viz., mostly energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence, e.g. with polarized high-energy beam excitation, and automated electron probe X-ray microanalysis, together with other techniques, to identify particle types and their sources in indoor environments, including museums, while gaseous indoor pollutants were assessed using passive diffusion samplers. In each case, both bulk aerosols and individual aerosol particles were studied. For microanalysis of single particles, we have investigated a dozen techniques, but for wide, real-life applications, automated electron probe X-ray microanalysis is the most rewarding.</p>
					<p>We have ﬁrst studied atmospheric aerosols in and around the Correr Museum in Venice, many other museums in Austria, Japan and England, and in the caves with prehistoric rock paintings in Altamira, Spain. Very recently, measurements were done in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Wawel Castle in Cracow, in Italian and Polish mountain churches, in a number of museums in Belgium and the Netherlands, and in cathedrals with medieval stained glass windows. In the Correr museum, it appeared that the particles most threatening for the Bellini paintings were released by the deteriorating plaster renderings, and this could be avoided by simply improving the rendering on the museum walls. In the Wawel Castle, outdoor pollution particles, like ﬁne soot from diesel trafﬁc, entering via leaks in the windows and doors, and also street-deicing salts and coal burning pollution particles, brought in by visitors, mostly in winter, were found to be most worrisome.</p>
					<p>Urgent questions that are not solved at this moment pertain to the deposition processes from the atmosphere to the cultural heritage items, the critical surface interactions that take place on these items, and the establishment of suitable particle concentration standards.</p>

				<title>Total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence and energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence characterizations of nuclear materials</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0201-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nuclear energy is one of the clean options of electricity generation for the betterment of human life. India has an ambitious program for such electricity generation using different types of nuclear reactors. The safe and efﬁcient generation of electricity from these reactors requires quality control of different nuclear materials, e.g. nuclear fuel, structural materials, coolant, moderators etc. These nuclear materials have to undergo strict quality control and should have different speciﬁed parameters for their use in nuclear reactors. The concentration of major and trace elements present in these materials should be within speciﬁed limits. For such chemical quality control of these materials, major and trace elemental analytical techniques are required. Since some of these materials are radioactive, the ideal chemical characterization techniques should have multielement analytical capability, should require very less sample (micrograms level) for analysis so that the radioactive waste generated, and radiation exposure to the detector and operator are minimum. Total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence (TXRF) and energy dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence (EDXRF) with improved features, e.g. application of ﬁlters, secondary target and instrumental geometry require very small amount of sample and thus can be suitably used for the characterization of nuclear materials mainly for the determination of elements at trace and major concentration levels. In Fuel Chemistry Division, TXRF analytical methods have been developed for trace element determinations in uranium and thorium oxides, chlorine determination in nuclear fuel and cladding materials, sulphur in uranium, uranium in sea water etc. Similarly, EDXRF analytical methods with radiation ﬁlters (to reduce background) and improved sample preapartion techniques, e.g. fusion bead and taking samples in the form of solution on ﬁlter papers have been used for developing analytical methods for the determination of U and Th in their mixed matrices, Cd in uranium etc. Some ofthese studies have been reported in this paper.</p>

				<title>New applications of the good old wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0213-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence can be characterized by its advantages and drawbacks. Unbeaten spectral resolution in a range below 5 keV, good operational stability, excellent ability of making averaged analysis, and good presentation of peak shape which gives the basis for the chemical speciation are the advantages. Among the drawbacks, the following are important: system with sequential analysis of particular elements, low output of energy supplied to the device, and great cost of instrument which can be amortized only in routine operations. In routine geological and environmental analyses, the WD-XRF performs better than other simpler instrumental or wet techniques. WD-XRF is continuously improved, by applying new multilayer interference mirrors (MIM) for detection and quantiﬁcation of very light elements. Bad spectral resolution of MIM noted earlier is now improved by tailoring their shape to the shape of gratings. The progress in the long wavelength spectral region joined with efﬁcient and precise wavelength resolution systems enables the application of WD-XRF for speciation analysis. In another effort, XRF spectrometry is treated as a tool for obtaining quantitative basis for the judgement on Linnaean systematic classiﬁcation of plants and opens the ﬁeld to a new discipline – quantitative biology.</p>

				<title>Inﬂuence of near-edge processes in the elemental analysis using X-ray emission-based techniques</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0223-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The near-edge processes, such as X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (XAFS) andresonant Raman scattering (RRS), are not incorporated in the available theoretical attenuation coefﬁcients, which are known to be reliable at energies away from the shell/subshell ionization thresholds of the attenuator element. Theoretical coefﬁcients are generally used to estimate matrix corrections in routine quantitative elemental analysis based on various X-ray emission techniques. A tabulation of characteristic X-ray energies across the periodic table is provided where those X-rays are expected to alter the attenuation coefﬁcients due to XAFS from a particular shell/subshell of the attenuator element. The inﬂuence of XAFS to the attenuation coefﬁcient depends upon the atomic environment and the photoelectron wave vector, i.e., difference in energies of incident X-ray and the shell/subshell ionization threshold of the attenuator element. Further, the XAFS at a shell/subshell will signiﬁcantly alter the total attenuation coefﬁcient if the jump ratio at that shell/subshell is large, e.g., the K shell, L$_3$ subshell and M$_5$ subshell. The tabulations can be considered as guidelines so as to know what can be expected due to XAFS in typical photon-induced X-ray emission spectrometry.</p>

				<title>Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence – A tool for interdisciplinary research</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0241-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Trace elements have been at the focus of attention for decades with considerable emphasis on their role in biology and biomedical sciences, environmental sciences, geology, archaeology and material sciences. They comprise a large number of elements, some having essential physiological functions, whereas others are toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic. A few even have antiproliferative and anticarciniogenic properties. The advent of various instrumental techniques and sophisticated instrumentations has made their detection to very low limits possible, making this a very important multidisciplinary study. Among these techniques the energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence (EDXRF) technique is being widely used for trace element detection in various ﬁelds of science. Keeping the importance of trace elements in mind, the Kolkata centre of UGC-DAE Consortium for Scientiﬁc Research initiated several research schemes in different ﬁelds of trace element research using various techniques, EDXRF being one of the main techniques. A Xenemetrix (erstwhile Jordan Valley) EX 3600 EDXRF spectrometer is being used to carry out the research. This presentation aims to highlight some of the very recent applications of EDXRF in the study of the role of trace elements in pre-cancerous tissues, medicinal plants and also in some environmental studies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>X-ray ﬂuorescence has been used to measure several elements noninvasively within living human subjects. Some description is given of the constraints imposed by this rather unusual form of analysis together with a brief listing indicating the range of elements for which such analyses have been developed. Measurements of two elements are then presented in more detail. Lead is measured in bone and has become a well-established tool in continuing research into the long term effects of lead. Strontium is also measured in bone and, although presently not in widespread use, offers the potential for essential information in the study of the reported beneﬁts of strontium supplementation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present study utilized the new hard X-ray microspectroscopy beamline facility, X27A, available at NSLS, BNL, USA, for elemental mapping. This facility provided the primary beam in a small spot of the order of $\sim 10 \mu m$, for focussing. With this spatial resolution and high ﬂux throughput, the synchrotron-based X-ray ﬂuorescent intensities for Mn, Fe, Zn, Cr, Ti and Cu were measured using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled 13-element energy-dispersive high-purity germanium detector. The sample is scanned in a `step-and-repeat’ mode for fast elemental mapping measurements and generated elemental maps at 8, 10 and 12 keV, from a small animal shell (snail). The accumulated trace elements, from these biological samples, in small areas have been identiﬁed. Analysis of the small areas will be better suited to establish the physiology of metals in speciﬁc structures like small animal shell and the distribution of other elements.</p>

				<title>Quantitative energy-dispersive electron probe X-ray microanalysis for single-particle analysis and its application for characterizing atmospheric aerosol particles</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0281-0292</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An energy-dispersive electron probe X-ray microanalysis (ED-EPMA) technique using an energy-dispersive X-ray detector with an ultra-thin window, designated as low-Z particle EPMA, has been developed. The low-Z particle EPMA allows the quantitative determination of concentrations of low-Z elements such as C, N and O, as well as higher-Z elements that can be analysed by conventional ED-EPMA. The quantitative determination of low-Z elements (using full Monte Carlo simulations, from the electron impact to the X-ray detection) in individual particles has improved the applicability of single-particle analysis, especially in atmospheric environmental aerosol research; many environmentally important atmospheric particles, e.g. sulphates, nitrates, ammonium and carbonaceous particles, contain low-Z elements. To demonstrate its practical applicability, the application of the low-Z particle EPMA for the characterization of Asian Dust, urban and subway aerosol particles is shown herein. In addition, it is demonstrated that the Monte Carlo calculation can also be applied in a quantitative single-particle analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), showing that the technique is useful and reliable for the characterization of submicron aerosol particles</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence (EDXRF) especially in its portable version, generally characterized by a small X-ray tube and a Si-PIN or Si-drift detector is particularly useful to analyse works of art. EDXRF technique is nondestructive, noninvasive and multielemental. A variety of works, such as paintings of all types (including frescos and illuminated manuscripts), bronzes and brasses, gold alloys, silver alloys, ceramics, porcelains and faiences, papers, ink, stones of all types (marbles, obsidians etc.), stamps, etc. can be studied using a portable EDXRF equipment. In this paper, examples are given for analysis of the works of art with a portable EDXRF equipment.</p>

				<title>Spectral distribution of the $2S \to 1S$ two-photon transition in atoms and few-electron ions</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0331-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The two-photon decay of the $2S$ state to the ground state in dressed atoms and oneor two-electron ions has been studied for several decades. Relativistic calculations have shown an $Z$-dependence of the spectral shape of this two-photon transition in one- or two-electron ions. We have measured the spectral distribution of the $1s2s {}^1 S_0 \to  1_s {}^2 {}^1 S_0$ two-photon transition in He-like tin at the ESR storage ring using a new approach for such experiments. In this method, relativistic collisions of initially Li-like projectiles with a gaseous target were used to populate exclusively the ﬁrst excited state, $1_s2_s$, of He-like tin, which provided a clean two-photon spectrum. The measured two-photon spectral distribution was compared with fully relativistic calculations. The obtained results show very good agreement with the calculations for He-like tin</p>

				<title>X-ray microbeams based on Kumakhov polycapillary optics and its applications: Analytical consideration</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0339-0344</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kumakhov polycapillary optics is based on the effective passage of X-ray radiation through bundles of monocapillaries of various conﬁgurations. The passage of radiation takes place because of the total external reﬂection of X-rays from the inner capillary walls. In this work,the basic characteristics of intense quasi-parallel X-ray polycapillary microbeams from a laboratory source with microfocus X-ray tube/polycapillary cylindrical structure are investigated theoretically (analytical consideration). The data generated from theoretical estimations are compared  with the experimental results. Several new generations of X-ray analytical devices like, laboratory synchrotron, ﬂuorescent spectrometers, reﬂectometers/refractometers, diffractometers, X-ray microscopes and combinations of several such devices, are developed based on polycapillary optics. Besides, a number of devices can be developed for the most modern research problems such as nanomateriology, namely, X-ray nanoscanner, portable X-ray nanothickness indicator etc. X-ray tubes and the radiators, specially developed for polycapillary optics as efﬁciently as possible, are used in all the devices mentioned above.</p>

				<title>Energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence study of elemental uptake in cauliﬂower</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0345-0349</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A$^{109}$Cd radioisotope-induced energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence (EDXRF) study has been performed on samples of cauliﬂower consisting of the flower, the leaves and the associated root soil. The cauliﬂowers were collected from farms near the main dumping site of municipal solid waste in the city of Kolkata, India and also from uncontaminated farms about 50 km away from the city. A uniﬁed calibration approach was undertaken for the elemental analysis of the samples of widely varying matrices. The present study suggests that the elemental concentrations in the root soils and leaves of the samples vary from farm to farm, whereby the concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb in root soils of MSW-contaminated farms are higher by almost an order of magnitude compared to uncontaminated farms. But, the most notable feature of this study is the strikingly similar elemental concentrations in the edible ﬂower part of all samples irrespective of the type of soil.</p>

				<title>6 MeV storage ring dedicated to hard X-ray imaging and far-infrared spectroscopy</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0351-03550</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The tabletop storage ring, 6 MeV MIRRORCLE, is dedicated to hard X-ray imaging as well as far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy. In spite of low electron energy, the 6 MeV MIRRORCLE generates hard X-rays ranging from 10 keV up to its electron energy and milliwatt order submillimetre range FIR rays. Bremsstrahlung is the mechanism for the hard X-ray generation. Images produced with $11 \times$ geometrical magniﬁcation display a sharply enhanced edge effect when generated using a 25 mm rod electron target. Bright far-infrared is generated in the same way using a conventional synchrotron light source, but with MIRRORCLE the spectral ﬂux is found to be $\sim 1000$ times greater than that of a standard thermal source. Partially coherent enhancement is observed in the case of FIR output.</p>

				<title>Trace determination of uranium in fertilizer samples by total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0357-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Uranium is reported to be present in phosphate fertilizers. The recovery of uranium from the fertilizers is important because it can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors and also because of environmental concerns. For both these activities suitable method of uranium determinations at trace levels in these fertilizers are required. Studies have been initiated for such TXRF determination of uranium and the results are reported in the present paper. For TXRF determinations the fertilizer samples were processed with nitric acid and the uranium present in it was removed by solvent extraction using tri-n-butyl phosphate as the extractant. The organic phase containing uranium was equilibrated with 1.5&#37; suprapure nitric acid to bring out uranium in aqueous phase. This aqueous phase was mixed with internal standard Y and the TXRF spectra were measured by depositing samples on ﬂoat glass supports. The amounts of uranium in four fertilizer samples of Hungarian origin were determined by processing these TXRF spectra. Uranium concentrations in two fertilizer samples were found to be in the range of $4–6 \mu g/g$, whereas two fertilizer samples did not show the presence of uranium. The precision of the TXRF determination of uranium was found to be better than 8&#37; ($1\sigma$).</p>

				<title>Application of total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrometry for trace elemental analysis of rainwater</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0361-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Applicability of total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence (TXRF) spectrometry for trace elemental analysis of rainwater samples was studied. The study was used to develop these samples as rainwater standards by the National University of Singapore (NUS). Our laboratory was one of the participants to use TXRF for this study. The rainwater sample obtained from NUS was analysed by TXRF and the trace elements Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, V and Pb were determined as required by the NUS. The average precision was found to be within 16&#37; and the TXRF-determined elemental concentrations of these elements were below $20 \mu g/l$. The average deviation of TXRFdetermined values from the certiﬁed values were 20&#37; (excluding the deviation for Fe and V which were comparatively high). Apart from the above elements, S, K, Ca, Rb, Sr, Ba and Br were also determined by TXRF and were found to be in the range of 0.2 to 191 $\mu g/l$. TXRF-determined values of our laboratory played an important role in the certiﬁcation of concentration of seven elements in this rainwater sample which was later developed as a rainwater standard.</p>				</abstract>

					<p>Numerical studies of anomalous diffusion in undamped but periodically-driven and parametrically-driven pendulum systems are presented. When the frequency of the periodic driving force is varied, the exponent $\mu$, which is the rate of divergence of the mean square displacement with time, is found to vary in an oscillatory manner. We show the presence of such a variation in other statistical measures such as variance of position, kurtosis, and exponents in the power-exponential law of probability distribution of position.</p>

				<title>Inverse synchronization of coupled fractional-order systems through open-plus-closed-loop control</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0385-0396</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the inverse synchronization problem of fractional-order dynamical systems is investigated. A general explicit coupling via an open-plus-closed-loop control for inverse synchronization of two arbitrary unidirectionally or bidirectionally coupled fractional-order systems is proposed. The inverse synchronization is proved analytically based on the stability theorem of the fractional differential equations. A key feature of this proposed scheme is that it can be applied not only to nonchaotic but also to chaotic fractional-order systems whenever they exhibit regular or irregular oscillations. Feasibility of the proposed inverse synchronization scheme is illustrated through numerical simulations.</p>

				<title>Separation of different wave components in the Bethe–Salpeter wave function</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0397-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The scalar products of polarization tensor and unit vectors are presented explicitly in spherical coordinate system expanded in terms of spherical harmonic functions. By applying the obtained formulae, different wave components in the Salpeter wave function can be shown explicitly, and the results are consistent with the results obtained by $L -S$ coupling analysis. The cancelation formula is given, by which the terms with pure $L = J + 1$ wave components in the Salpeter wave function for the bound state with $\eta_P = (-1)^J$ can be obtained by separating the $L = J - 1$ wave components from mixing terms.

				<feature />
				<page>0407-0420</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study a particular approach for analysing worldsheet conformal invariance for bosonic string propagating in a curved background using Hamiltonian formalism. We work in the Schrödinger picture of a single-particle description of the problem where the particle moves in an inﬁnite-dimensional space. Background independence is maintained in this approach by adopting DeWitt’s (Phys. Rev. 85, 653–661, 1952) coordinate-independent formulation of quantum mechanics. This enables us to construct certain background-independent notion of Virasoro generators, called DeWitt–Virasoro (DWV) generators, and invariant matrix elements of an arbitrary operator constructed out of them in spin-zero representation. We show that the DWV algebra is given by the Witt algebra with additional anomalous terms that vanish for Ricci-ﬂat backgrounds. The actual quantum Virasoro generators should be obtained by ﬁrst introducing the vacuum state and then normal ordering the DWV generators with respect to that. We demonstrate the procedure in ﬂat and pp-wave backgrounds.</p>

				<title>Drell–Yan process at Large Hadron Collider</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0421-0430</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Drell–Yan process at LHC, $q\bar{q} \to Z/ \gamma^{\ast} \to \ell^+ \ell^-$, is one of the benchmarks for conﬁrmation of Standard Model at TeV energy scale. Since the theoretical prediction for the rate is precise and the ﬁnal state is clean as well as relatively easy to measure, the process can be studied at the LHC even at relatively low luminosity. Importantly, the Drell–Yan process is an irreducible background to several searches of beyond Standard Model physics and hence the rates at LHC energies need to be measured accurately. In the present study, the methods for measurement of the Drell–Yan mass spectrum and the estimation of the cross-section have been developed for LHC operation at the centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 100 pb$^{-1}$ in the context of CMS experiment</p>

				<title>Cluster radioactivity leading to doubly magic ${}^{100}$Sn and ${}^{132}$Sn daughters</title>

				<page>0431-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Decay of neutron-deﬁcient ${}^{128−137}$Gd parents emitting ${}^4$He to ${}^{32}$S clusters are studied within the Coulomb and proximity potential model. The predicted half-lives are compared with other models and most of the values are well within the present experimental limit for measurements ($T_{1/2}$ &#60; $10^{30} s$). The lowest $T_{1/2}$ value for ${}^{28}$Si emission from ${}^{128}$Gd indicates the role of doubly magic ${}^{100}$Sn daughter in cluster decay process. It is also found that neutron excess in the parent nuclei slows down the cluster decay process. Geiger–Nuttal plots for all clusters are found to be linear with different slopes and intercepts. The $\alpha$-decay half-lives of ${}^{148−152}$Gd parents are computed and are in agreement with experimental data. The role of doubly magic ${}^{132}$Sn daughter in cluster decay process is also examined for various neutron-rich Ba, Ce, Nd, Sm and Gd parents emitting clusters ranging from ${}^4$He to ${}^{32}$Si. Alpha-like structures are most probable in the decays leading to ${}^{100}$Sn, while non-$\alpha$-like structures are probable in the decays leading to ${}^{132}$Sn. The neutron–proton asymmetry in parent and daughter nuclei is responsible for the reduced decay rate in the decay leading to ${}^{132}$Sn.</p>

					<p>The neutron skin effect has been investigated for even isotopes of molybdenum at 25.6 MeV ${}^{94−100}$Mo($p, xn$) reaction using the geometry-dependent hybrid model of pre-equilibrium nuclear reactions. Here the initial neutron/proton exciton numbers were calculated from the neutron/proton densities obtained from an effective nucleon–nucleon interaction of the Skyrme type. Initial exciton numbers from different radii of even Mo isotopes were used to obtain the corresponding neutron emission spectra. In this investigation the calculated results are compared with the experimental data as also with each other. The results using central densities in the geometry-dependent hybrid model are in better agreement with the experimental data.</p>

				<title>Total and ionization cross-sections of N$_2$ and CO by positron impact: Theoretical investigations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0477-0488</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we report our calculations on several important total cross-sections (TCS$_s$) of positron impact on isoelectronic N$_2$ and CO molecules, treated in the complex spherical potential formalism. Basically the total (complete) cross-section $Q_T$ consists of elastic and inelastic contributions. Our total inelastic cross-section ($Q_{\text{inel}}) contains ionization and electronic excitations together with positronium formation. Our goal here is to bifurcate $Q_{\text{inel}}$ further to deduce total ionization cross-section, using the `complex scattering potential–ionization contribution’ (CSP-ic) method of electron–atom/molecule scattering. The present range of positron energy is 15–2000 eV. All the resulting cross-sections are in a good general accord with the existing data. This work highlights the importance of various scattering channels in $e^+ - N_2$ and $e^+ - CO$ interactions at intermediate and high energies.</p>

					<p>Self-ﬁeld effects, induced by charge and current densities of the electron beam, on gain in two-stage free-electron laser with nonuniform guide magnetic ﬁeld is presented. The gain equation for small-signal has been derived analytically. The results of numerical calculations show a gain decrement for group I orbits and a gain enhancement for group II orbits, due to the self-ﬁeld effects. The wiggler-induced self-magnetic ﬁeld has a diamagnetic effect for group I orbits, whereas for group II, it has a paramagnetic effect. It is also found that using a nonuniform guide ﬁeld, rather than a uniform one, causes the gain to increase.</p>

				<page>0501-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Performance of the backward wave oscillator (BWO) is greatly enhanced with the introduction of plasma. Linear theory of the dispersion relation and the growth rate have been derived and analysed numerically for plasma-ﬁlled rippled wall rectangular waveguide driven by sheet electron beam. To see the effect of plasma on the TM$_{01}$ cold wave structure mode and on the generated frequency, the parameters used are: relativistic factor $\gamma = 1.5$ (i.e. $v/c = 0.741$), average waveguide height $y_0 = 1.445$ cm, axial corrugation period $z_0 = 1.67$ cm, and corrugation amplitude $\epsilon = 0.225$ cm. The plasma density is varied from zero to $2\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{−3}$. The presence of plasma tends to raise the TM$_{01}$ mode cut-off frequency (14 GH$_z$ at $2 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{−3}$ plasma density) relative to the vacuum cut-off frequency (5 GH$_z$) which also causes a decrease in the group velocity everywhere, resulting in a ﬂattening of the dispersion relation. With the introduction of plasma, an enhancement in absolute instability was observed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Three demonstration samples of intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) ﬁlms were deposited using hot wire–chemical vapour deposition (HW–CVD) technique. The optical parameters and the thickness were determined from the extremes of the interference fringes of transmission spectrum in the range of 400–2500 nm using the envelope method. The calculated values of the refractive index ($n$) were ﬁtted using the two-term Cauchy dispersion relation and the static refractive index values ($n_0$) obtained were 2.799, 2.629 and 3.043 which were in the range of the reported values. The calculated thicknesses for all samples were cross-checked with Taly-Step proﬁlometer and found to be almost equal. Detailed analysis was carried out to obtain the optical band gap ($E_g$) using Tauc’s method and the estimated values were 1.99, 2.01 and 1.75 eV. The optical band gap values were correlated with the hydrogen content ($C_H$) in the samples calculated from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. An attempt was made to apply Wemple–DiDomenico single-effective oscillator model to the a-Si:H samples to calculate the optical parameters. The optical band gap obtained by Tauc’s method and the static refractive index calculated from Cauchy ﬁtting are in good agreement with those obtained by the single-effective oscillator model. The real and the imaginary parts of dielectric constant ($\epsilon_r, \epsilon_i$), and the optical conductivity ($\sigma$) were  also calculated.</p>

				<title>Bianchi type-I massive string magnetized barotropic perfect ﬂuid cosmological model in bimetric theory</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0543-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bianchi type-I massive string cosmological model for perfect ﬂuid distribution in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld is investigated in Rosen’s [Gen. Relativ. Gravit. {\bf 4}, 435 (1973)] bimetric theory of gravitation. To obtain the deterministic model in terms of cosmic time, we have used the condition $A = (B C)^n$, where n is a constant, between the metric potentials. The magnetic ﬁeld is due to the electric current produced along the $x$-axis with inﬁnite electrical conductivity. Some physical and geometrical properties of the exhibited model are discussed and studied.</p>

				<title>A transformed rational function method for (3+1)-dimensional potential Yu–Toda–Sasa–Fukuyama equation</title>

				<page>0561-0571</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A direct method, called the transformed rational function method, is used to construct more types of exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations by introducing new and more general rational functions. To illustrate the validity and advantages of the introduced general rational functions, the (3+1)-dimensional potential Yu–Toda–Sasa–Fukuyama (YTSF) equation is considered and new travelling wave solutions are obtained in a uniform way. Some of the obtained solutions, namely exponential function solutions, hyperbolic function solutions, trigonometric function solutions, Jacobi elliptic function solutions and rational solutions, contain an explicit linear function of the independent variables involved in the potential YTSF equation. It is shown that the transformed rational function method provides more powerful mathematical tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0573-0589</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Within the framework of the radially constrained spherical Hartree–Fock (CSHF) approximation, the resonance effects of delta on the properties of neutron-rich double magic spherical nucleus ${}^{132}$Sn were studied. It was found that most of the increase in the nuclear energy generated under compression was used to create massive $\Delta$ particles. For ${}^{132}$Sn nucleus under compression at 3.19 times density of the normal nuclear density, the excited nucleons to $\Delta$s were increased sharply up to 16&#37; of the total number of constituents. This result is consistent with the values extracted from relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The single particle energy levels were calculated and their behaviours under compression were examined. A meaningful agreement was obtained between the results with effective Hamiltonian and that with the phenomenological shell model for the low-lying single-particle spectra. The results suggest considerable reduction in compressibility for the nucleus, and softening of the equation of state with the inclusion of $\Delta$s in the nuclear dynamics.</p>

					<p>We study the reﬂection of a Hermite–Gaussian beam at an interface between two dielectric media. We show that unlike Laguerre–Gaussian beams, Hermite–Gaussian beams undergo no signiﬁcant distortion upon reﬂection. We report Goos–Hänchen shift for all the spots of a higherorder Hermite–Gaussian beam near the critical angle. The shift is shown to be insigniﬁcant away from the critical angle. The calculations are carried out neglecting the longitudinal component along the direction of propagation for a spatially ﬁnite, s-polarized, full 3D vector beam. We brieﬂy discuss the difﬁculties associated with the paraxial approximation pertaining to a vector Gaussian beam.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ultrasonic properties of the hexagonal closed packed structured $Ni_3$Mo, $Ni_3$Nb and $Ni_3$Ta compounds were studied at room temperature for their characterization. For the investigations of ultrasonic properties, the second-order elastic constants using Lennard–Jones potential were computed. The velocities $V_1$ and $V_2$ have minima and maxima respectively at $45^{\circ}$ with the unique axis of the crystal, while $V_3$ increases with respect to angle with the unique axis of the crystal. The inconsistent behaviour of angle-dependent velocities is associated with the action of second-order elastic constants. Debye average sound velocities of these compounds increase with the angle and has maximum at $55^{\circ}$ with the unique axis at room temperature. Hence, when a sound wave travels at $55^{\circ}$ with the unique axis of these materials, the average sound velocity is found to be maximum. The results achieved are discussed and compared with the available experimental and theoretical results.</p>

					<p>Resonance width, shift in resonance frequency, relaxation time and activation energy of 5CB nematic liquid crystal are measured using microwave cavity technique under the inﬂuence of an external magnetic ﬁeld at 9 GHz and at different temperatures. The dielectric response in liquid crystal at different temperatures and the effects of applied magnetic ﬁeld on transition temperatures are studied in the present work.

				<abstract>
					<p>Meyer–Neldel (MN) formula for DC conductivity ($\sigma_{\text{DC}}$) of chalcogenide glasses is obtained using extended pair model and random free energy barriers. The integral equations for DC hopping conductivity and external conductance are solved by iterative procedure. It is found that MN energy ($\Delta E_{\text{MN}}$) originates from temperature-induced conﬁgurational and electronic disorders. Single polaron-correlated barrier hopping model is used to calculate $\sigma_{\text{DC}}$ and the experimental data of Se, As$_2$S$_3$, As$_2$Se$_3$ and As$_2$Te$_3$ are explained. The variation of attempt frequency $\upsilon_0$ and $\Delta E_{\text{MN}}$ with parameter $(r/a)$, where $r$ is the intersite separation and $a$ is the radius of localized states, is also studied. It is found that $\upsilon_0$ and $\Delta E_{\text{MN}}$ decrease with increase of $(r/a)$, and $\Delta E_{\text{MN}}$ may not be present for low density of defects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The comparison of the inversion electron density between a nanometer metal-oxidesemiconductor (MOS) device with high-$K$ gate dielectric and a SiO$_2$ MOS device with the same equivalent oxide thickness has been discussed. A fully self-consistent solution of the coupled Schrödinger–Poisson equations demonstrates that a larger dielectric-constant mismatch between the gate dielectric and silicon substrate can reduce electron density in the channel of a MOS device under inversion bias. Such a reduction in inversion electron density of the channel will increase with increase in gate voltage. A reduction in the charge density implies a reduction in the inversion electron density in the channel of a MOS device. It also implies that a larger dielectric constant of the gate dielectric might result in a reduction in the source–drain current and the gate leakage current.</p>

				<title>A simpliﬁed approach for the generation of projection data for cone beam geometry</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0667-0679</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To test a developed reconstruction algorithm for cone beam geometry, whether it is transmission or emission tomography, one needs projection data. Generally, mathematical phantoms are generated in three dimensions and the projection for all rotation angles is calculated. For non-symmetric objects, the process is cumbersome and computation intensive. This paper describes a simple methodology for the generation of projection data for cone beam geometry for both transmission and emission tomographies by knowing the object’s attenuation and/or source spatial distribution details as input. The object details such as internal geometrical distribution are nowhere involved in the projection data calculation. This simple approach uses the pixilated object matrix values in terms of the matrix indices and spatial geometrical coordinates. The projection data of some typical phantoms (generated using this approach) are reconstructed using standard FDK algorithm and Novikov’s inversion formula. Correlation between the original and reconstructed images has been calculated to compare the image quality.</p>

					<p>Bianchi type-V string cosmological models in general relativity are investigated. To get the exact solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, we have taken some scale transformations used by Camci et al [Astrophys. Space Sci. ${\bf 275}$, 391 (2001)]. It is shown that Einstein’s ﬁeld equations are solvable for any arbitrary cosmic scale function. Solutions for particular forms of cosmic scale functions are also obtained. Some physical and geometrical aspects of the models are discussed.</p>

				<title>Working group report: Physics at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0707-0723</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This is a summary of the activities of the $\textit{Physics at the LHC}$ working group in the XIth Workshop on High Energy Physics Phenomenology (WHEPP-XI) held at the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India in January 2010. We discuss the activities of each sub-working group on physics issues at colliders such as Tevatron and Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The main issues discussed involve (1) results on W mass measurement and associated QCD uncertainties, (2) an attempt to understand the asymmetry measured at Tevatron in the top quark production, and (3) phenomenology of warped space dimension model.</p>

				<title>New exact travelling wave solutions of bidirectional wave equations</title>

				<page>0819-0829</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The surface water waves in a water tunnel can be described by systems of the form [Bona and Chen, $\textit{Physica}$ ${\bf D116}$, 191 (1998)] 
					\begin{equation*}
					\begin{cases}
					 v_t + u_x + (uv)_x + au_{x x x} − bv_{x x t} = 0,\\
					 u_t + v_x + u u_x + cv_{x x x} − d u_{x x t} = 0,
					\end{cases} \tag{1}
					\end{equation*} where $a$, $b$, $c$ and d are real constants. In general, the exact travelling wave solutions will be helpful in the theoretical and numerical study of the nonlinear evolution systems. In this paper, we obtain exact travelling wave solutions of system (1) using the modiﬁed tanh–coth function method with computerized symbolic computation.</p>

					<p>In this work, we present travelling wave solutions for the Burgers, Burgers–Huxley and modiﬁed Burgers–KdV equations. The ($G'/G$)-expansion method is used to determine travelling wave solutions of these sets of equations. The travelling wave solutions are expressed by the hyperbolic functions, the trigonometric functions and the rational functions. It is shown that the proposed method is direct, effective and can be used for many other nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics.</p>

				<title>On a new formulation of microphenomena: Basic principles, stationary ﬁelds and beyond</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0843-0873</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a series of essays, beginning with this article, we are going to develop a new formulation of microphenomena based on the principles of reality and causality. The new theory provides us with a new depiction of microphenomena assuming a uniﬁed concept of information, matter and energy. So, we suppose that in a deﬁnite microphysical context (including other interacting particles), each particle is enfolded by a probability ﬁeld whose existence is contingent on the existence of the particle, but it can locally affect the physical status of the particle in a context-dependent manner. The dynamics of the whole particle-ﬁeld system obeys deterministic equations in a manner such that when the particle is subjected to a conservative force, the ﬁeld also experiences a conservative complex force, the form of which is determined by the dynamics of the particle. So, the ﬁeld is endowed with a given amount of energy, but its value is contingent on the physical conditions the particle is subjected to. Based on the energy balance of the particle and its associated ﬁeld, we argue why the ﬁeld has a probabilistic objective nature. The basic elements of this new formulation, its application for some stationary states and its nonlinear generalization for conservative systems are discussed here.</p>

					<p>We present solutions of the Dirac equation with spin symmetry for vector and scalar modiﬁed Pöschl–Teller potentials within the framework of an approximation of the centrifugal term. The relativistic energy spectrum is obtained using the Nikiforov–Uvarov method and the two-component spinor wave functions obtained are in terms of the Jacobi polynomials. It is found that there exist only positive energy states for bound states under spin symmetry, and the energy of a level with ﬁxed value of $n$, increases with increase in dimension of space time and the potential range parameter $\alpha$.</p>

				<title>Robust adaptive fuzzy neural tracking control for a class of unknown chaotic systems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0887-0900</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, an adaptive fuzzy neural controller (AFNC) for a class of unknown chaotic systems is proposed. The proposed AFNC is comprised of a fuzzy neural controller and a robust controller. The fuzzy neural controller including a fuzzy neural network identiﬁer (FNNI) is the principal controller. The FNNI is used for online estimation of the controlled system dynamics by tuning the parameters of fuzzy neural network (FNN). The Gaussian function, a speciﬁc example of radial basis function, is adopted here as a membership function. So, the tuning parameters include the weighting factors in the consequent part and the means and variances of the Gaussian membership functions in the antecedent part of fuzzy implications. To tune the parameters online, the back-propagation (BP) algorithm is developed. The robust controller is used to guarantee the stability and to control the performance of the closed-loop adaptive system, which is achieved always. Finally, simulation results show that the AFNC can achieve favourable tracking performances.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we have established the equation of state (EOS) for liquids. The EOS was established for hard-sphere (HS) ﬂuid along with Lennard–Jones (LJ) ﬂuid incorporating perturbation techniques. The calculations are based on suitable axiomatic functional forms for surface tension $S_m (r )$, $r \geq d/2$ with intermolecular separation $r$, as a variable, and $m$ is an arbitrary real number (pole). The results for $\beta P/ \rho$ from the present EOS thus obtained are compared with Percus-Yevick (PY), scaled particle theory (SPT), and Carnahan–Starling (CS). In addition, we have found a simple EOS for the HS ﬂuid in the region which represents the simulation data accurately.</p>
					<p>It is observed that, this EOS for HS gives, PY (pressure) for $m = 0$, CS for $m = 4/5$, whereas for $m = 1$ it corresponds to SPT.</p>

				<title>Stability of the fragments and thermalization at the peak centre-of-mass energy</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0909-0919</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We simulated the central reactions of nearly symmetric and asymmetric systems, for energies at which maximum production of intermediate mass fragments (IMF$_s$) occurred ($E^{\text{peak}}_{\text{c.m.}}$). This study was carried out using hard EOS along with Cugnon cross-section employing MSTB method for clusterization. We studied the various properties of fragments. The stability of fragments was checked through persistence coefﬁcient and gain term. The information about the thermalization and stopping in heavy-ion collisions was obtained via relative momentum, anisotropy ratio and rapidity distribution. We found that for a complete stopping of incoming nuclei very heavy systems are required. The mass dependence of various quantities (such as average and maximum central density, collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear matter) was also presented. In all cases (i.e., average and maximum central density, collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear matter) a power-law dependence was obtained.</p>				</abstract>

				<title>Quantum ion-acoustic solitary waves in weak relativistic plasma</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0933-0944</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Small amplitude quantum ion-acoustic solitary waves are studied in an unmagnetized twospecies relativistic quantum plasma system, comprised of electrons and ions. The one-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic model (QHD) is used to obtain a deformed Korteweg–de Vries (dKdV) equation by reductive perturbation method. A linear dispersion relation is also obtained taking into account the relativistic effect. The properties of quantum ion-acoustic solitary waves, obtained from the deformed KdV equation, are studied taking into account the quantum mechanical effects in the weak relativistic limit. It is found that relativistic effects signiﬁcantly modify the properties of quantum ion-acoustic waves. Also the effect of the quantum parameter $H$ on the nature of solitary wave solutions is studied in some detail.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear stability of pulsational mode of gravitational collapse in self-gravitating hydrostatically bounded dust molecular cloud</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0945-0956</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pulsational mode of gravitational collapse (PMGC) in a hydrostatically bounded dust molecular cloud is responsible for the evolution of tremendous amount of energy during star formation. The source of free energy for this gravito-electrostatic instability lies in the associated self-gravity of the dispersed phase of relatively huge dust grains of solid matter over the gaseous phase of background plasma. The nonlinear stability of the same PMGC in an inﬁnite dusty plasma model (plane geometry approximation for large wavelength ﬂuctuation in the absence of curvature effects) is studied in a hydrostatic kind of homogeneous equilibrium conﬁguration. By the standard reductive perturbation technique, a Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation for investigating the nonlinear evolution of the lowest order perturbed self-gravitational potential is developed in a time-stationary (steady-state) form, which is studied analytically as well as numerically. Different nonlinear structures (soliton-like and soliton chain-like) are found to exist in different situations. Astrophysical situations, relevant to it, are brieﬂy discussed.</p>

				<page>0957-0963</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Good-quality hexagonal NbSe$_2$ single crystals were prepared. In 2H-NbSe$_2$, superconducting and charge density wave (CDW) transitions were found at $T_s = 7.4$ K and $T_c = 35$ K respectively as reported previously. We have noticed that these two transitions are changed to $T_c = 42$ K and $T_s = 6.5$ K, in 4H-NbSe$_2$. Thermopower has shown clear anomaly at CDW transitions. The anisotropic upper critical ﬁeld was calculated as $\sim 3$ and 6.3 for 2H- and 4H-single crystals around $t = 0.81$, where $t = T/T_s$, from resistivity and explained in terms of coherence length. From the relation, $H_{c2}(T) = H_{c2}(0)[1 − t^2]$, $H^l_{c2}(0)$ was calculated as $\sim 8.15$ T and 16.98 T at $t = 0.84$ in 2H-NbSe$_2$ and 4H-NbSe$_2$ respectively. However, $H^t_{c2}(0) = 2.68$ T for both single crystals.</p>

				<title>The effect of C atom concentration on the electronic properties of boron carbonitride alloy nanotube in zig-zag form</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0965-0972</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electronic properties of single-walled boron nitride nanotube in zig-zag form are numerically investigated by replacing B atoms with C atoms. Using a tight-binding Hamiltonian, the methods based on Green’s function theory, Landauer formalism and Dyson equation, the electronic density of states and electronic conductance in boron nitride nanotube and boron carbonitride nanotube are calculated. Our calculations indicate that in a boron nitride nanotube, the localized states associated with C impurities appear as the concentration of C atoms increases. The boron carbonitride nanotube thus behaves like a semiconductor. Also, by increasing the C atom concentration, the voltage in the ﬁrst step on the $I–V$ characteristics decreases, whereas the corresponding current increases.</p>

				<title>Inﬂuence of drying conditions on the optical and structural properties of sol–gel-derived ZnO nanocrystalline ﬁlms</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0973-0983</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc oxide nanothin ﬁlms were prepared on glass substrate by sol–gel dip-coating method using zinc acetate dihydrate, methanol, and monoethanolamine as precursor, solvent, and stabilizer, respectively. The relationship between drying conditions and the characteristics of ZnO nanocrystalline ﬁlms ($c$-axis orientation, grain size, roughness and optical properties) was studied. The ﬁlms were dried in an oven at different temperatures and by IR radiation. Then, the ﬁlms were annealed at $500^{\circ}$C in a furnace. The chemical composition, transmission spectra, structure, and morphology of the samples were studied using infrared (IR) and UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. The XRD results show that the drying conditions affect the orientation of crystallization along the (0 0 2) plane. AFM images show that the thicknesses of the ﬁlms decrease from 128 to 93 nm by changing the drying conditions. The photoluminescence (PL) of ZnO nanothin ﬁlms shows the UV emission at near band edge and broad green radiation at about 465 nm wavelength.</p>

				<title>Hydrodynamic stability and stellar oscillations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0003-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chandrasekhar’s monograph on $\textit{Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability}$, published in 1961, is a standard reference on linear stability theory. It gives a detailed account of stability of ﬂuid ﬂow in a variety of circumstances, including convection, stability of Couette ﬂow, Rayleigh–Taylor instability, Kelvin–Helmholtz instability as well as the Jean’s instability for star formation. In most cases he has extended these studies to include effects of rotation and magnetic ﬁeld. In a later paper he has given a variational formulation for equations of non-radial stellar oscillations. This forms the basis for helioseismic inversion techniques as well as extension to include the effect of rotation, magnetic ﬁeld and other large-scale ﬂows using a perturbation treatment.</p>

				<title>Disks around young stellar objects</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0019-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By 1939, when Chandrasekhar’s classic monograph on the theory of \textit{Stellar Structure} was published, although the need for recent star formation was fully acknowledged, no one had yet recognized an object that could be called a star in the process of being born. Young stellar objects (YSOs), as pre-main-sequence stars, were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s. Infrared excess emission and intrinsic polarization observed in these objects in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that they are surrounded by ﬂattened disks. The YSO disks were seen in direct imaging only in the 1980s. Since then, high-resolution optical imaging with HST, near-infrared adaptive optics on large groundbased telescopes, mm and radiowave interferometry have been used to image disks around a large number of YSOs revealing disk structure with ever-increasing detail and variety. The disks around YSOs are believed to be the sites of planet formation and a few such associations have now been conﬁrmed. The observed properties of the disk structure and their evolution, that have very important consequences for the theory of star and planet formation, are discussed.</p>

				<title>Beyond the Chandrasekhar limit: Structure and formation of compact stars</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0029-0037</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concept of limiting mass, introduced by Chandrasekhar in case of white dwarfs, plays an important role in the formation and stability of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes. Like white dwarfs, neutron stars have their own mass limit, and a compact conﬁguration would progress from one family to the next, more dense one once a mass limit is crossed. The mass limit of neutron stars depends on the nature of nuclear forces at very high density, which has so far not been determined conclusively. This article reviews how observational determinations of the properties of neutron stars are starting to impose signiﬁcant constraints on the state of matter at high density</p>

				<title>Extracting science from surveys of our Galaxy</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0039-0052</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Our knowledge of the Galaxy is being revolutionized by a series of photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric surveys. Already an enormous body of data is available from completed surveys, and data of ever-increasing quality and richness will accrue at least until the end of this decade. To extract science from these surveys, we need a class of models that can give probability density functions in the space of the observables of a survey – we should not attempt to ‘invert’ the data from the space of observables into the physical space of the Galaxy. Currently just one class of model has the required capability, the so-called ‘torus models’. A pilot application of torus models to understand the structure of the Galaxy’s thin and thick discs has already produced two signiﬁcant results: a major revision of our best estimate of the Sun’s velocity with respect to the local standard of rest, and a successful prediction of the way in which the vertical velocity dispersion in the disc varies with distance from the Galactic plane.</p>

				<title>Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability of black holes with radiative transfer</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0053-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (Chandra) was just eight years old when the ﬁrst astrophysical jet was discovered in M87. Since then, jets have been uncovered with a wide variety of sources including accretion disks orbiting stellar and massive black holes, neutron stars, isolated pulsars, $\gamma$-ray bursts, protostars and planetary nebulae. This talk will be primarily concerned with collimated hydromagnetic outﬂows associated with spinning, massive black holes in active galactic nuclei. Jets exhibit physical processes central to three of the major research themes in Chandrasekhar’s research career – radiative transfer, magnetohydrodynamics and black holes. Relativistic jets can be thought of as `exhausts’ from both the hole and its orbiting accretion disk, carrying away the energy liberated by the rotating spacetime and the accreting gas that is not radiated. However, no aspect of jet formation, propagation and radiation can be regarded as understood in detail. The combination of new $\gamma$-ray, radio and optical observations together with impressive advances in numerical simulation make this a good time to settle some long-standing debates.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Some of the contributions of Chandrasekhar to the ﬁeld of magnetohydrodynamics are highlighted. Particular emphasis is placed on the Chandrasekhar–Kendall functions that allow a decomposition of a vector ﬁeld into right- and left-handed contributions. Magnetic energy spectra of both contributions are shown for a new set of helically forced simulations at resolutions higher than what has been available so far. For a forcing function with positive helicity, these simulations show a forward cascade of the right-handed contributions to the magnetic ﬁeld and nonlocal inverse transfer for the left-handed contributions. The speed of inverse transfer is shown to decrease with increasing value of the magnetic Reynolds number.</p>

				<title>Chandrasekhar’s book $\textit{An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure}$</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0097-0105</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For me, and for many astrophysicists of my generation, Chandrasekhar’s book $\textit{An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure}$ was very important. I could not have done my PhD (1962–1965) without it. Much more recently (1998) I realized that I could not have written my lecture course on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics without much of it, particularly the ﬁrst chapter. I shall present anecdotal evidence that the inﬂuence of his discussion on the second law of thermodynamics has been important not just for astrophysics but for a much wider range of physics.</p>
					<p>Chandrasekhar’s discussion of polytropes was masterly. Even today polytropes play an important role as an aid for understanding stellar structure. I believe that to the list of analytic solutions of the polytrope only one more has to be added: a curious $n = 5$ model of Srivastava (1962).</p>
					<p>Stellar structure is nowadays a very computationally intensive subject. I shall illustrate this with a couple of topics from my experience with Djehuty, a supercomputer code for modelling stars in 3D. Nevertheless it remains true, I believe, that analytical mathematical entities like polytropes are fundamental as aids for understanding what the computers churn out.</p>
					<p>How close are we to seeing a book with the title `The Last Word on the Study of Stellar Structure’? Not very, although much has been learned in 70 years. I shall discuss a few of the aspects of stellar evolution that are problematic today.</p>
					<p>I shall discuss a couple of aspects where I believe analysis of `piecewise polytropic’ structures sheds light on the question `Why do stars become red giants?’</p>

					<p>A few examples are given of Chandra’s work on statistical and stochastic problems that relate to open questions in astrophysics, in particular his theory of dynamical relaxation in systems with inverse-square interparticle forces. The roles of chaos and integrability in this theory require clariﬁcation, especially for systems having a dominant central mass. After this prelude, a hypothetical form of bosonic dark matter with a simple but nontrivial statistical mechanics is discussed. This makes for a number of eminently falsiﬁable predictions, including some exotic consequences for dynamical friction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chandra’s academic life had several phases each culminating in a monograph describing that subject. I shall deal with aspects of his work in the two earliest phases. I shall describe the overall structure of statistical mechanics of gravitating systems, the relevance of isothermal sphere in the mean-ﬁeld approximation and issues related to collisional relaxation and dynamical friction in self-gravitating system of particles. There are several curious features in the history of these topics which I comment upon.</p>

				<title>Multiple scattering polarization – Application of Chandrasekhar’s formalisms to the atmosphere of brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0157-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chandrasekhar’s formalisms for the transfer of polarized radiation are used to explain the observed dust scattering polarization of brown dwarfs in the optical band. Model polarization profiles for hot and young directly imaged extrasolar planets are presented with specific prediction of the degree of polarization in the infrared. The model invokes Chandrasekhar’s formalism for the rotation-induced oblateness of the objects that gives rise to the necessary asymmetry for yielding net non-zero disk integrated linear polarization. The observed optical polarization constrains the surface gravity and could be a tool to estimate the mass of extrasolar planets.</p>

				<title>Symmetry in stochasticity: Random walk models of large-scale structure</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0169-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the insights gained from the excursion set approach, in which various questions about the phenomenology of large-scale structure formation can be mapped to problems associated with the ﬁrst crossing distribution of appropriately deﬁned barriers by random walks. Much of this is summarized in R K Sheth, \textit{AIP Conf. Proc.} 1132, 158 (2009). So only a summary is given here, and instead a few new excursion set related ideas and results which are not published elsewhere are presented. One is a generalization of the formation time distribution to the case in which formation corresponds to the time when half the mass was ﬁrst assembled in pieces, each of which was at least $1/n$ times the ﬁnal mass, and where $n \geq 2$; another is an analysis of the ﬁrst crossing distribution of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. The ﬁrst derives from the mirror-image symmetry argument for random walks which Chandrasekhar described so elegantly in 1943; the second corrects a misuse of this argument. Finally, some discussion of the correlated steps and correlated walks assumptions associated with the excursion set approach, and the relation between these and peaks theory are also included. These are problems in which Chandra’s mirror-image symmetry is broken.</p>

				<title>Magnetohydrodynamics turbulence: An astronomical perspective</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0185-0198</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Early work on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the 1960s due, independently, to Iroshnikov and Kraichnan (IK) considered isotropic inertial-range spectra. Whereas laboratory experiments were not in a position to measure the spectral index, they showed that the turbulence was strongly anisotropic. Theoretical horizons correspondingly expanded in the 1980s, to accommodate both the isotropy of the IK theory and the anisotropy suggested by the experiments. Since the discovery of pulsars in 1967, many years of work on interstellar scintillation suggested that small-scale interstellar turbulence must have a hydromagnetic origin; but the IK spectrum was too ﬂat and the ideas on anisotropic spectra too qualitative to explain the observations. In response, new theories of balanced MHD turbulence were proposed in the 1990s, which argued that the IK theory was incorrect, and made quantitative predictions of anisotropic inertial-range spectra; these theories have since found applications in many areas of astrophysics. Spacecraft measurements of solar-wind turbulence show that there is more power in Alfvén waves that travel away from the Sun than towards it. Theories of imbalanced MHD turbulence have now been proposed to address interplanetary turbulence. This very active area of research continues to be driven by astronomy.</p>

				<title>The origin of the strongest magnetic ﬁelds in dwarfs</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0199-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>White dwarfs have frozen in magnetic ﬁelds ranging from below the measurable limit of about $3 \times 10^3$ to $10^9$ G. White dwarfs with surface magnetic ﬁelds in excess of 1 MG are found as isolated single stars and relatively more often in magnetic cataclysmic variables. Some 1253 white dwarfs with a detached low-mass main-sequence companion have been identiﬁed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) but none of these shows sufﬁcient evidence for Zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines for a magnetic ﬁeld in excess of 1 MG. If such high magnetic ﬁelds in white dwarfs result from the isolated evolution of a single star then there should be the same fraction of high ﬁeld white dwarfs among this SDSS binary sample as among single stars. Thus, we deduce that the origin of such high magnetic ﬁelds must be intimately tied to the formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs). The formation of a CV must involve orbital shrinkage from giant star to main-sequence star dimensions. It is believed that this shrinkage occurs as the low-mass companion and the white dwarf spiral together inside a common envelope. CVs emerge as very close but detached binary stars that are then brought together by magnetic braking or gravitational radiation. We propose that the smaller the orbital separation at the end of the common envelope phase, the stronger the magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic cataclysmic variables (MCVs) originate from those common envelope systems that almost merge. Those common envelope systems that do merge are the progenitors of the single high ﬁeld white dwarfs. Thus all highly magnetic white dwarfs, be they single stars or the components of MCVs, have a binary origin. This accounts for the relative dearth of single white dwarfs with ﬁelds of $10^4$ – $10^6$ G. Such intermediate-ﬁeld white dwarfs are found preferentially in cataclysmic variables. The bias towards higher masses for highly magnetic white dwarfs is expected if a fraction of these form when two degenerate cores merge in a common envelope. From the space density of single highly magnetic white dwarfs we estimate that about three times as many common envelope events lead to a merged core as to a cataclysmic variable.</p>

				<title>Exact travelling solutions for some nonlinear physical models by ($G'/G$)-expansion method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0263-0275</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we establish exact solutions for some special nonlinear partial differential equations. The ($G'/G$)-expansion method is used to construct travelling wave solutions of the twodimensional sine-Gordon equation, Dodd–Bullough–Mikhailov and Schrödinger–KdV equations, which appear in many ﬁelds such as, solid-state physics, nonlinear optics, ﬂuid dynamics, ﬂuid ﬂow, quantum ﬁeld theory, electromagnetic waves and so on. In this method we take the advantage of general solutions of second-order linear ordinary differential equation (LODE) to solve many nonlinear evolution equations effectively. The ($G'/G$)-expansion method is direct, concise and elementary and can be used with a wider applicability for handling many nonlinear wave equations.</p>

				<title>Experimental study of the $\pi h_{11/2}$ band in ${}^{113}$Sb</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0277-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work, the excited states of ${}^{113}$Sb were populated in the ${}^{100}$Mo(${}^{20}$Ne, $p6n$) reaction at a beam energy of 136 MeV. States only up to $59/2^−$ were observed in the $\Delta J = 2$ band. Mean lifetimes for the ﬁve states (from 4460 to 7998 keV) were measured for the ﬁrst time using Doppler shift attenuation method. An upper limit of the lifetime (0.14 ps) was estimated for the 9061 keV, $47/2^−$ state. The $B(E2)$ values, derived from the present lifetime results, correspond to a large quadrupole deformation of $\beta_2 = 0.32$. The observed reduction in the experimental $B(E2)$ values for the 918.4 keV (spin $39/2^− \to 35/2^−$) and 985 keV (spin $43/2^−  \to 39/2^−$) transitions may be interpreted as due to the proton alignement in the $g_{7/2}$ orbital. The dynamic moment of inertia was observed to be about half of the rigid body value at the highest observed frequency.</p>

					<p>We studied the transverse ﬂow throughout the mass range from ${}^{20} \text{Ne}+{}^{20}\text{Ne}$ to ${}^{131}$Xe+${}^{131}$Xe as a function of the impact parameter. We found that at smaller impact parameters the ﬂow is negative while going through the impact parameter, transverse ﬂow vanishes at a particular colliding geometry named GVF. We found that the mass dependence of GVF is insensitive to the equation of state and momentum-dependent interactions whereas it is quite sensitive to the cross-section. So it can act as a useful tool to pin down the nucleon–nucleon cross-section.</p>

				<title>Rapidity dependence of multiplicity ﬂuctuations and correlations in high-energy nucleus–nucleus interactions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0297-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The multiplicity ﬂuctuations of the produced pions were studied using scaled variance method in ${}^{16}$O–AgBr interactions at 2.1 AGeV, ${}^{24}$Mg–AgBr interactions at 4.5 AGeV, ${}^{12}$C–AgBr interactions at 4.5 AGeV, ${}^{16}$O–AgBr interactions at 60 AGeV and ${}^{32}$S–AgBr interactions at 200 AGeV at two different binning conditions. In the ﬁrst binning condition, the rapidity interval was varied in steps of one centring about the central rapidity until it reached 14. In the second case, the rapidity interval was increased in steps of 1.6 up to 14.4. Multiplicity distributions and their scaled variances were presented as a function of the dependence on the rapidity width for both the binning conditions. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations were found to increase with the increase of rapidity interval and later found to saturate at larger rapidity window for all the interactions and in both the binning conditions. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations were found to increase with the energy of the projectile beam. The values of the scaled variances were found to be greater than one in all the cases in both the binning conditions indicating the presence of correlation during the multiparticle production process in high-energy nucleus–nucleus interactions. Experimental results were compared with the results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulated events for all the interactions. The Monte Carlo simulated data showed very small values of scaled variance suggesting very small ﬂuctuations for the simulated events. Experimental results obtained from ${}^{16}O–AgBr interactions at 60 AGeV and ${}^{32}S–AgBr interactions at 200 AGeV were compared with the events generated by Lund Monte Carlo code (FRITIOF model). FRITIOF model failed to explain the multiplicity ﬂuctuations of pions emitted from ${}^{16}$O–AgBr interactions at 60 AGeV for both the binning conditions. However, the experimental data agreed well with the FRITIOF model for ${}^{32}$S–AgBr interactions at 200 AGeV.</p>

				<title>Improved analysis on multiple recycling of fuel in prototype fast breeder reactor in a closed fuel cycle</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0315-0333</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An FBR closed fuel cycle involves recycling of the discharge fuel, after reprocessing and refabrication, to utilize the unburnt fuel remains and the freshly bred ﬁssile material. Our previous study in this regard for the PFBR indicated a comfortable feasibility of multiple recycling with selfsufﬁciency. In the present work, more reﬁned estimations are done using the most recent nuclear data, viz. ENDF/B-VII.0, and with the most recent speciﬁcation of the fuel composition. Among others, this paper brings out the importance of taking into account the energy self-shielding effects in the cross-section averages used in the study. While self-shielded averages lead to realistic predictions, unshielded averages signiﬁcantly overpredict breeding in the blankets and underpredict loss in the cores.</p>

				<title>Experimental measurement of effective atomic number of composite materials for Compton effect in the $\gamma$-ray region 280–1115 keV by a new method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0335-0344</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we report a new method to determine the effective atomic number, $Z_{\text{eff}}$, of composite materials for Compton effect in the γ -ray region 280–1115 keV based on the theoretically obtained Klein–Nishina scattering cross-sections in the angular range $50^{\circ}–100^{\circ}$ as well as a method to experimentally measure differential incoherent (Compton) scattering cross-sections in this angular range. The method was employed to evaluate $Z_{\text{eff}}$ for different inorganic compounds containing elements in the range $Z = 1–56$, at three scattering angles $60^{\circ}$, $80^{\circ}$ and $100^{\circ}$ at three incident gamma energies 279.1 keV, 661.6 keV and 1115.5 keV and we have veriﬁed this method to be an appropriate method. Interestingly, the $Z_{\text{eff}}$ values so obtained for the inorganic compounds were found to be equal to the total number of electrons present in the sample as given by the atomic number of the elements constituting the sample in accordance with the chemical formula of the sample.

				<title>Experimental investigation of ultrasonic velocity anisotropy in magnetic ﬂuids: Inﬂuence of grain–grain interaction</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0345-0355</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Magnetic ﬁeld-induced dispersion of ultrasonic velocity in a Mn$_{0.7}$Zn$_{0.3}$Fe$_{2}$O$_4$ ﬂuid (applied magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the ultrasonic propagation vector) is determined by employing continuous wave method. The magnitude of dispersion initially decreases with increasing ﬁeld, then increases and reaches a plateau at higher ﬁelds. Results indicate that the velocity anisotropy is dominated by grain–grain interactions rather than grain–ﬁeld interaction. At the critical temperature, the grain–grain interaction becomes weak as the transverse component of the particle/cluster moment is larger than the longitudinal one and the system reaches saturation even at low ﬁeld. These observed variations in the ﬁeld-induced anisotropy are analysed by incorporating the moment distribution of particles in Tarapov’s theory (\textit{J. Magn. Magn. Mater.} 39, 51 (1983)).</p>

					<p>A dusty multi-ion plasma system consisting of non-isothermal (trapped) electrons, Maxwellian (isothermal) light positive ions, warm heavy negative ions and extremely massive charge ﬂuctuating stationary dust have been considered. The dust-ion-acoustic solitary and shock waves associated with negative ion dynamics, Maxwellian (isothermal) positive ions, trapped electrons and charge ﬂuctuating stationary dust have been investigated by employing the reductive perturbation method. The basic features of such dust-ion-acoustic solitary and shock waves have been identiﬁed. The implications of our ﬁndings in space and laboratory dusty multi-ion plasmas are discussed.</p>

					<p>Oblique interaction of small- but ﬁnite-amplitude KdV-type electron-acoustic solitary excitations is examined in an unmagnetized two-electron-populated degenerate quantum electron–ion plasma in the framework of quantum hydrodynamics model using the extended Poincaré–Lighthill–Kuo (PLK) perturbation method. Critical plasma parameter is found to distinguish the types of solitons and their interaction phase-shifts. It is shown that, depending on the critical quantum diffraction parameter $H_{cr}$, both compressive and rarefactive solitary excitations may exist in this plasma and their collision phase-shifts can be either positive or negative for the whole range of collision angles $0 &#60; θ  &#60; π$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>All-electron full potential calculations based on spin density functional theory were performed to study cubic zincblende (ZB) and hexagonal NiAs structures of bulk CrTe and ZnTe/CrTe(0 0 1), CdTe/CrTe(0 0 1) and CdSe/CrTe(0 0 1) interfaces. The lattice mismatch effect in ZB CrTe and magnetic properties of CrTe in the ideal ZB CrTe structure were investigated. The band alignment properties of the ZnTe/CrTe(0 0 1), CdTe/CrTe(0 0 1) and CdSe/CrTe(0 0 1) interfaces were computed and a rather large minority valence band offset of about 1.09 eV was observed in ZnTe/CrTe(0 0 1) heterojunction. Also in the CdTe/CrTe(0 0 1) and CdSe/CrTe(0 0 1) interfaces, the conduction band minimum of minority spin in CrTe was above the conduction band minimum of CdTe and CdSe and so the majority spin electrons could be directly injected to both semiconductors, indicating the possibility of highly efﬁcient spin injection into the CdSe and CdTe semiconductors.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Structural and associational aspects of polar amides ($j$) like formamide, acetamide, Nmethyl acetamide (NMA), N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMA) and acetanilide dissolved in the nonpolar solvent ($i$) benzene or 1,4-dioxan have been estimated from the measured static relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{0ij}$ and high-frequency permittivity $\varepsilon_{\infty ij}$ at different weight fractions $w_j$s of polar solute at $35^{\circ}$C under static electric ﬁeld using Debye model of polar liquid molecule. The static dipole moments $\mu_s$s are compared with $\mu_j$s reported from conductivity method and theoretical $\mu_{\text{theo}$s to get exact $\mu_{\text{cal}} \cdot \mu_{\text{theo}$s of the molecules are predicted from the available bond angles and bond moments where difference in electron afﬁnity exists between two adjacent atoms of a polar group due to inductive, mesomeric and electromeric effects in them. Solute–solute molecular association for NMA in benzene and solute–solvent association for other amides are ascertained to arrive at their conformational structures.</p>

				<title>Isometric embeddings in cosmology and astrophysics</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0415-0428</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent interest in higher-dimensional cosmological models has prompted some signiﬁ-cant work on the mathematical technicalities of how one goes about embedding spacetimes into some higher-dimensional space. We survey results in the literature (existence theorems and simple explicit embeddings); brieﬂy outline our work on global embeddings as well as explicit results for more complex geometries; and provide some examples. These results are contextualized physically, so as to provide a foundation for a detailed commentary on several key issues in the ﬁeld such as: the meaning of `Ricci equivalent’ embeddings; the uniqueness of local (or global) embeddings; symmetry inheritance properties; and astrophysical constraints.</p>

				<page>0433-0437</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Had Einstein followed the Bianchi differential identity for the derivation of his equation of motion for gravitation, $\Lambda$ would have emerged as a true new constant of spacetime on the same footing as the velocity of light? It is then conceivable that he could have perhaps made the most profound prediction that the Universe may suffer accelerated expansion some time in the future! Further we argue that its identiﬁcation with the quantum vacuum energy is not valid as it should have to be accounted for like the gravitational ﬁeld energy by enlarging the basic framework of spacetime and not through a stress tensor. The acceleration of the expansion of the Universe may indeed be measuring its value for the ﬁrst time observationally.</p>

					<p>We obtain a class of solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell equations describing charged static spheres. Upon specifying particular forms for one of the gravitational potentials and the electric ﬁeld intensity, the condition for pressure isotropy is transformed into a hypergeometric equation with two free parameters. For particular parameter values we recover uncharged solutions corresponding to speciﬁc neutron star models. We ﬁnd two charged solutions in terms of elementary functions for particular parameter values. The ﬁrst charged model is physically reasonable and the metric functions and thermodynamic variables are well behaved. The second charged model admits a negative energy density and violates the energy conditions.</p>

					<p>We investigate the role of symmetries for charged perfect fluids by assuming that spacetime admits a conformal Killing vector. The existence of a conformal symmetry places restrictions on the model. It is possible to ﬁnd a general relationship for the Lie derivative of the electromagnetic ﬁeld along the integral curves of the conformal vector. The electromagnetic ﬁeld is mapped conformally under particular conditions. The Maxwell equations place restrictions on the form of the proper charge density.</p>

				<title>A note on the Lie symmetries of complex partial differential equations and their split real systems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0483-0491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Folklore suggests that the split Lie-like operators of a complex partial differential equation are symmetries of the split system of real partial differential equations. However, this is not the case generally. We illustrate this by using the complex heat equation, wave equation with dissipation, the nonlinear Burgers equation and nonlinear KdV equations. We split the Lie symmetries of a complex partial differential equation in the real domain and obtain real Lie-like operators. Further, the complex partial differential equation is split into two coupled or uncoupled real partial differential equations which constitute a system of two equations for two real functions of two real variables. The Lie symmetries of this system are constructed by the classical Lie approach. We compare these Lie symmetries with the split Lie-like operators of the given complex partial differential equation for the examples considered. We conclude that the split Lie-like operators of complex partial differential equations are not in general symmetries of the split system of real partial differential equations. We prove a proposition that gives the criteria when the Lie-like operators are symmetries of the split system.</p>

				<title>Effects of non-uniform interfacial tension in small Reynolds number ﬂow past a spherical liquid drop</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0493-0507</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A singular perturbation solution is given for small Reynolds number ﬂow past a spherical liquid drop. The interfacial tension required to maintain the drop in a spherical shape is calculated. When the interfacial tension gradient exceeds a critical value, a region of reversed ﬂow occurs on the interface at the rear and the interior ﬂow splits into two parts with reversed circulation at the rear. The magnitude of the interior ﬂuid velocity is small, of order the Reynolds number. A thin transition layer attached to the drop at the rear occurs in the exterior ﬂow. The effects could model the stagnant cap which forms as surfactant is added but the results apply however the variability in the interfacial tension might have been induced.</p>

					<p>This paper provides a very brief introduction to three of Chandrasekhar’s famous books on Stellar Structure, Hydrodynamics and Black Holes. In particular we summarize Chandra’s treatment of the “Thermal Instability” which plays such a crucial role in the understanding of convection zones in stellar atmospheres. We also outline three important ideas in ﬂuid dynamics which are inexplicably omitted from Chandrasekhar’s Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability; the ﬁrst is the Brunt–Väisȧlä frequency which appears in internal gravity waves and is closely related to Schwarzschild’s stability criterion; the second is the baroclinic instability which is important in atmospheric dynamics and meteorology, and the third is the conservation of potential vorticity which is central to the understanding of the planetary scale – Rossby waves.</p>

					<p>Transient heat transfer through a longitudinal ﬁn of various proﬁles is studied. The thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients are assumed to be temperature dependent.

				<title>An investigation of embeddings for spherically symmetric spacetimes into Einstein manifolds</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0533-0543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Embeddings into higher dimensions are very important in the study of higherdimensional theories of our Universe and in high-energy physics. Theorems which have been developed recently guarantee the existence of embeddings of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds into Einstein spaces and more general pseudo-Riemannian spaces. These results provide a technique that can be used to determine solutions for such embeddings. Here we consider local isometric embeddings of four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes into ﬁve-dimensional Einstein manifolds. Difﬁculties in solving the ﬁve-dimensional equations for given four-dimensional spaces motivate us to investigate embedded spaces that admit bulks of a speciﬁc type. We show that the general Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetime and Einstein Universe are the only spherically symmetric spacetimes that can be embedded into an Einstein space of a particular form, and we discuss their ﬁve-dimensional solutions.</p>

In particular, a range of consequences on the form of the wave equation, the symmetries and number of conservation laws, inter alia, are altered by the manifold on which the model wave rests. We ﬁnd Lie and Noether point symmetries of the corresponding wave equations and give some reductions. Some interesting physical conclusions relating to conservation laws such as energy, linear and angular momenta are also determined.

				<title>Estimate of stellar masses from their QPO frequencies</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0571-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kilohertz quasiperiodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) are observed in binary stellar systems. For such a system, the stellar radius is very close to the marginally stable orbit $R_{\text{ms}}$ as predicted by Einstein’s general relativity. Many models have been proposed to explain the origin of the kHz QPO features in the binaries. Here we start from the work of Li et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf 83}$, 3776 (1999)) who in 1999, from the unique millisecond X-ray pulsations, suggested SAX J1808.4−3658 to be a strange star, from an accurate determination of its rotation period. It showed kHz QPOs eight years ago and so far it is the only set that has been observed. We suggest that the mass of four compact stars SAX J1808.4−3658, KS 1731−260, SAX J1750.8−2900 and IGR J17191−2821 can be determined from the difference in the observed kHz QPOs of these stars. It is exciting to be able to give an estimate of the mass of the star and three other compact stars in low-mass X-ray binaries using their observed kHz QPOs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we provide invariant linearizability criteria for a class of systems of four second-order ordinary differential equations in terms of a set of 30 constraint equations on the coefﬁcients of all derivative terms. The linearization criteria are derived by the analytic continuation of the geometric approach of projection of two-dimensional systems of cubically semi-linear secondorder differential equations. Furthermore, the canonical form of such systems is also established. Numerous examples are presented that show how to linearize nonlinear systems to the free particle Newtonian systems with a maximally symmetric Lie algebra relative to $sl$(6, $\mathfrak{R}$) of dimension 35.</p>

					<p>This paper deals with surface proﬁlometry, where we try to detect a periodic structure, hidden in randomness using the matched ﬁlter method of analysing the intensity of light, scattered from the surface. From the direct problem of light scattering from a composite rough surface of the above type, we ﬁnd that the detectability of the periodic structure can be hindered by the randomness, being dependent on the correlation function of the random part. In our earlier works, we had concentrated mainly on the Cauchy-type correlation function for the rough part. In the present work, we show that this technique can determine the periodic structure of different kinds of correlation functions of the roughness, including Cauchy, Gaussian etc. We study the detection by the matched ﬁlter method as the nature of the correlation function is varied.</p>

The present investigation deals with a technique to design and study the characteristics of an achromatic combination of birefringent plates in 800–2000 nm range. The retarder has been designed using calcite, crystalline quartz and ADP. The thicknesses of the plates are 19.38 $\mu$m, 446.14 $\mu$m and 12.57 $\mu$m respectively. The new arrangement of three birefringent plates proposed has the promise of producing a zero-order quarter wave achromatic combination with fairly good accuracy.</p>

				<title>Analysis of adiabatic transfer in cavity quantum electrodynamics</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0633-0653</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A three-level atom in a $\Lambda$ conﬁguration trapped in an optical cavity forms a basic unit in a number of proposed protocols for quantum information processing. This system allows for efﬁcient storage of cavity photons into long-lived atomic excitations, and their retrieval with high ﬁdelity, in an adiabatic transfer process through the ‘dark state’ by a slow variation of the control laser intensity. We study the full quantum mechanics of this transfer process with a view to examine the non-adiabatic effects arising from inevitable excitations of the system to states involving the upper level of $\Lambda$, which is radiative. We ﬁnd that the ﬁdelity of storage is better, the stronger the control ﬁeld and the slower the rate of its switching off. On the contrary, unlike the adiabatic notion, retrieval is better with faster rates of switching on of an optimal control ﬁeld. Also, for retrieval, the behaviour with dissipation is non-monotonic. These results lend themselves to experimental tests. Our exact computations, when applied to slow variations of the control intensity for strong atom–photon couplings, are in very good agreement with Berry’s superadiabatic transfer results without dissipation.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0655-0667</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An accurate numerical model to investigate the pump-to-signal relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer in two-pump ﬁbre optical parametric ampliﬁers (2-P FOPAs) for low modulation frequencies is presented. Compared to other models in the ﬁeld, this model takes into account the ﬁbre loss, pump depletion as well as the gain saturation. As a result, the model allows to include a wide range of practical circumstances, both in and beyond the undepleted pump regime, related to different applications of FOPAs. In the small-signal or undepleted pump regime, the model predicts the ripples of the RIN spectrum very well and yields better results than those of other models. It is shown that beyond the small-signal regime, pump power variations do not remain unchanged over the length of the ampliﬁer and for high signal powers, when the FOPA saturates, minimum pump-to-signal RIN transfer occurs. The results of the model are also compared with the available experimental data in the ﬁeld and a very good agreement can be seen.</p>

Low-stress mechanical properties of the treated and untreated wool fabrics were evaluated using Siro-fast technique which revealed that the tensile, bending, compression, shear, dimensional stability and surface properties were altered after the LTP treatment. Other properties such as thermal conductivity, thermal resistance and pilling propensity were also evaluated. The surface topographical changes of the wool ﬁbres after LTP treatment were analysed by scanning electron microscopy. The changes in these properties are supposed to be related closely to the interﬁbre and interyarn frictional force and increased surface area of the ﬁbres induced by the etching effect of plasma.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, some structural and optical properties of the zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were studied. The highly crystalline ZnO nanoparticles were produced by the hydrothermal and sol–gel methods. The analyses of the XRD patterns, STEM images and UV spectroscopy showed that the size of the nanoparticles prepared by oxalic acid was smaller than the ones by urea. The properties of oxalic acid and urea were also investigated to determine the most effective crystallization process of ZnO nanoparticles. It has been shown that pH, decomposition temperature and activity coefﬁcient of the complexing agent have certain effects on crystallization process.</p>

					<p>The ammonium halides are an interesting systems because of their polymorphism and the possible internal rotation of the ammonium ion. The static properties of the mixed ionic crystal NH$_4$Cl$_{1−x}$ Br$_x$ have been recently investigated, using the three-body potential model (TDPM) by applying Vegard’s law. Here, by using a simple theoretical model, we estimate the bulk modulus of the alloys NH$_4$Cl$_{1−x} Br$_x$ , in terms of the bulk modulus of the end members alone. The calculated values are comparable to those deduced from the three-body potential model (TDPM) by applying Vegard’s law.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the effects of swift heavy ion beam irradiation on the structural, chemical and optical properties of Makrofol solid-state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) were investigated. Makrofol-KG ﬁlms of 40 $\mu$m thickness were irradiated with oxygen beam ($O^{8+}$) with ﬂuences ranging between $10^{10}$ ion/cm$^{2}$ and $10^{12}$ ion/cm$^2$. Structural, chemical and optical properties were investigated using X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy and UV–visible spectroscopy methods. It is observed that the direct and indirect band gaps of Makrofol-KG decrease after the irradiation. The XRD study shows that the crystalline size in the ﬁlms decreases at higher ﬂuences. The intensity plots of FTIR measurements indicate the degradation of Makrofol at higher ﬂuences. Roughness of the surface increases at higher ﬂuence.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of hybridization of conduction electrons and f-level on superconductivity (SC) and antiferromagnetism (AFM) in the coexistent phase of rare-earth nickel borocarbide superconductors ($R$Ni$_2$B$_2$C) is reported. The Hamiltonian of the system is a mean ﬁeld one and has been solved by writing equations of motion for the single-particle Green functions. It is assumed that superconductivity arises due to BCS pairing mechanism in the presence of antiferromagnetism in nickel lattices of Ni$_2$B$_2$ plane. The expressions for superconducting and antiferromagnetic order parameters are derived using double time electron Green functions. The quasiparticle energy bands are plotted and the nature of band dispersion of the quasiparticles is studied.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This study examined the electrical and optical properties of red OLEDs (organic lightemitting diodes) with a four-layer structure, ITO/amorphous fluoropolymer (AF)/$N,N'$--diphenyl$N,N'$-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1, 1-biphenyl-4,$4'$-diamine (TPD)/R-H:R-D/lithium fluoride (LiF)/Al, containing a hole injection material, AF (amorphous fluoropolymer) and an electron injection material, LiF. Compared to the basic structure (two-layer structure), the brightness and luminous efficiency of the four-layer structure, ITO/TPD/R-H:R-D/Al, increased approximately 100 times (30,000 lm/m$^2$) and 150 times (51 lm/W), respectively, with an applied voltage. The excellent efficiency of the external proton was also increased 150 times (0.51&#37;). That is, the hole and electron injection layers improved the surface roughness of ITO and Al, and the interfacial physical properties. In addition, these layers allowed the smooth injection of holes and electrons. The luminance, luminous efficiency and external quantum efficiency were attributed to an increase in the recombination rates.</p>

				<page>0735-0747</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Elemental mixtures of Al, Cu, Fe powders with the nominal composition of Al$_{70}$Cu$_{20}$Fe$_{10}$ were mechanically alloyed in a planetary ball mill for 80 h. Subsequent annealing of the as-milled powders were performed at 600–800$^{\circ}$C temperature range for 4 h. Structural characteristics of the mechanically alloyed $Al$_{70}Cu$_{20}$Fe$_{10}$ powders with the milling time and the heat treatment were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Mechanical alloying of the Al$_{70}$Cu$_{20}$Fe$_{10}$ did not result in the formation of icosahedral quasicrystalline phase (i-phase) and a long time milling resulted in the formation of $\beta$-Al(Cu,Fe) solid solution phase ($\beta$-phase). The i-phase was observed only for short-time milled powders after heat treatment above $600^{\circ}$C. The $\beta$-phase was one of the major phases in the Al$_{70}$Cu$_{20}$Fe$_{10}$ alloy. The w-Al$_7$Cu$_2$Fe$_1$ phase (w-phase) was obtained only after heat treatment of the short-time milled and unmilled samples. The present investigation indicated that a suitable technique to obtain a large amount of quasicrystalline powders is to use a combination of short-time milling and subsequent annealing.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Inhalation of radon has been recognized as a health hazard. In the present work radon concentration was measured, in the atmosphere of the archaeological place, namely Catacomb of Kom El-Shuqafa, in Alexandria, Egypt, which is open to the public, using time-integrated passiveradon dosimeters containing LR-115 solid-state nuclear track detector. The measurements were performed throughout winter and summer. Seasonal variation of radon concentration, with the maximum in summer ranging from 243 to 574 Bq m$^{−3}$ and minimum in winter ranging from 64 to 255 Bq m$^{−3}$ was observed. Because of the variations of the catacomb ventilation system, the equilibrium factor between radon and its progeny ranges from 0.14 to 0.48. The tour guides are exposed to an average estimated annual effective dose ranging from 0.21 to 0.52 mSv y$^{−1}$ and the visitors from 0.88 to 2.28 $\mu$Sv y$^{−1}$. The effective doses the catacomb workers are exposed to ranged from 0.20 mSv y$^{−1}$ in winter to 4.65 mSv y$^{−1}$ in summer which exceeds the lower bound of the recommended level (3–10 mSv y$^{−1}$) (ICRP, 1993).</p>

				<title>Kondo effect and mesoscopic ﬂuctuations</title>
				<feature>Quantum Chaos</feature>
				<page>0769-0779</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two important themes in nanoscale physics in the last two decades are correlations between electrons and mesoscopic ﬂuctuations. Here we review our recent work on the intersection of these two themes. The setting is the Kondo effect, a paradigmatic example of correlated electron physics, in a nanoscale system with mesoscopic ﬂuctuations; in particular, we consider a small quantum dot coupled to a ﬁnite reservoir (which itself may be a large quantum dot). We discuss three aspects of this problem. First, in the high-temperature regime, we argue that a Kondo temperature $T_K$ which takes into account the mesoscopic ﬂuctuations is a relevant concept: for instance, physical properties are universal functions of $T/T_K$. Secondly, when the temperature is much less than the mean level spacing due to conﬁnement, we characterize a natural cross-over from weak to strong coupling. This strong coupling regime is itself characterized by well-deﬁned single-particle levels, as one can see from a Nozières Fermi-liquid theory argument. Finally, using a mean-ﬁeld technique, we connect the mesoscopic ﬂuctuations of the quasiparticles in the weak coupling regime to those at strong coupling.</p>

				<title>Classically induced suppression of energy growth in a chaotic quantum system</title>
				<feature>Quantum Chaos</feature>
				<page>0793-0802</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent experiments with Bose–Einstein condensates (BEC) in traps and speckle potentials have explored the dynamical regime in which the evolving BEC clouds localize due to the inﬂuence of classical dynamics. The growth of their mean energy is effectively arrested. This is in contrast with the well-known localization phenomena that originate due to quantum interferences. We show that classically induced localization can also be obtained in a classically chaotic, non-interacting system. In this work, we study the classical and quantum dynamics of non-interacting particles in a double-barrier structure. This is essentially a non-KAM system and, depending on the parameters, can display chaotic dynamics inside the ﬁnite well between the barriers. However, for the same set of parameters, it can display nearly regular dynamics above the barriers. We exploit this combination of two qualitatively different classical dynamical features to obtain saturation of energy growth.

					<p>We study the interplay of topology and dynamics of excitable nodes on random networks. Comparison is made between systems grown by purely random (Erd˝os–Rényi) rules and those grown by the Achlioptas process.

					<p>Sounds in the natural environment form an important class of biologically relevant nonstationary signals. We propose a dynamic spectral measure to characterize the spectral dynamics of such non-stationary sound signals and classify them based on rate of change of spectral dynamics.

				<page>0817-0826</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study the effect of learning dynamics on network topology. Firstly, a network of discrete dynamical systems is considered for this purpose and the coupling strengths are made to evolve according to a temporal learning rule that is based on the paradigm of spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP). This incorporates necessary competition between different edges. The ﬁnal network we obtain is robust and has a broad degree distribution. Then we study the dynamics of the structure of a formal neural network. For properly chosen input signals, there exists a steady state with a residual network. We compare the motif proﬁle of such a network with that of the real neural network of $C$. elegans and identify robust qualitative similarities. In particular, our extensive numerical simulations show that this STDP-driven resulting network is robust under variations of model parameters.</p>

				<title>Multiple dynamical time-scales in networks with hierarchically nested modular organization</title>
				<feature>Biological Systems</feature>
				<page>0833-0842</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many natural and engineered complex networks have intricate mesoscopic organization, e.g., the clustering of the constituent nodes into several communities or modules. Often, such modularity is manifested at several different hierarchical levels, where the clusters deﬁned at one level appear as elementary entities at the next higher level. Using a simple model of a hierarchical modular network, we show that such a topological structure gives rise to characteristic time-scale separation between dynamics occurring at different levels of the hierarchy. This generalizes our earlier result for simple modular networks, where fast intramodular and slow intermodular processes were clearly distinguished. Investigating the process of synchronization of oscillators in a hierarchical modular network, we show the existence of as many distinct time-scales as there are hierarchical levels in the system. This suggests a possible functional role of such mesoscopic organization principle in natural systems, viz., in the dynamical separation of events occurring at different spatial scales.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the collective behaviour of a one-dimensional ring of cells for conditions when the individual uncoupled cells show stable, bistable and oscillatory dynamics. We show that the global dynamics of this model multicellular system depends on the system size, coupling strength and the intrinsic dynamics of the cells. The intrinsic variability in dynamics of the constituent cells are suppressed to stable dynamics, or modiﬁed to intermittency under different conditions. This simple model study reveals that cell–cell communication, system size and intrinsic cellular dynamics can lead to evolution of collective dynamics in structured multicellular biological systems that is signiﬁcantly different from its constituent single-cell behaviour.</p>

					<p>We show how novel behaviour can emerge in complex systems at the global level through synchronization of the activities of their constituent units. Two mechanisms are suggested for the emergence, namely non-diffusive coupling and time delays. In this way, simple units can synchronize to display complex dynamics, or conversely, simple dynamics may arise from complex constituents.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper investigates synchronization in unidirectionally coupled dynamical systems wherein the inﬂuence of drive on response is cumulative: coupling signals are integrated over a time interval $\tau$. A major consequence of integrative coupling is that the onset of the generalized and phase synchronization occurs at higher coupling compared to the instantaneous $(\tau = 0)$ case. The critical coupling strength at which synchronization sets in is found to increase with $\tau$. The systems explored are the chaotic Rössler and limit cycle (the Landau–Stuart model) oscillators. For coupled Rössler oscillators the region of generalized synchrony in the phase space is intercepted by an asynchronous region which corresponds to anomalous generalized synchronization.</p>

					<p>The strength and stability properties of hierarchical load-bearing networks and their strengthened variants have been discussed in a recent work. Here, we study the avalanche time distributions on these load-bearing networks. The avalanche time distributions of the V-lattice, a unique realization of the networks, show power-law behaviour when tested with certain fractions of its trunk weights. All other avalanche distributions show Gaussian peaked behaviour. Thus the V-lattice is the critical case of the network. We discuss the implications of this result.</p>

				<title>Delay or anticipatory synchronization in one-way coupled systems using variable delay with reset</title>
				<feature>Synchronization, Coupled Systems and Networks</feature>
				<page>0891-0904</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a mechanism for the synchronization of one-way coupled nonlinear systems in which the coupling uses a variable delay, that is reset at ﬁnite intervals. Here the delay varies in the same way as the system in time and so the coupling function remains constant for the reset interval at the end of which it is reset to the value at that time. This leads to a novel and discrete error dynamics and the resulting general stability analysis is applicable to chaotic or hyperchaotic systems. We apply this method to standard chaotic systems and hyperchaotic time delay systems. The results of the detailed numerical analysis agree with the results from stability analysis in both cases. This method has the advantage that it is cost-effective since information from the driving system is needed only at intervals of reset. Further, in the context of time delay systems, optimization among the different time-scales depending upon the application is possible due to the ﬂexibility among the four different time-scales in our method, viz. delay in the driving system, anticipation in the response system, system delay time and reset time. We suggest a bi-channel scheme for implementing this method in communication ﬁeld with enhanced security</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Gross–Pitaevskii equation (GPE) describing the evolution of the Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) order parameter for weakly interacting bosons supports dark solitons for repulsive interactions and bright solitons for attractive interactions. After a brief introduction to BEC and a general review of GPE solitons, we present our results on solitons that arise in the BEC of hard-core bosons, which is a system with strongly repulsive interactions. For a given background density, this system is found to support both a dark soliton and an antidark soliton (i.e., a bright soliton on a pedestal) for the density proﬁle. When the background has more (less) holes than particles, the dark (antidark) soliton solution dies down as its velocity approaches the sound velocity of the system, while the antidark (dark) soliton persists all the way up to the sound velocity. This persistence is in contrast to the behaviour of the GPE dark soliton, which dies down at the Bogoliubov sound velocity. The energy–momentum dispersion relation for the solitons is shown to be similar to the exact quantum low-lying excitation spectrum found by Lieb for bosons with a delta-function interaction.</p>

					<p>We aim to study the nonlinear optical phenomena with ultra-broadband radiation in photonic crystal ﬁbre (PCF). While PCFs with cores made from different glasses are well studied in previous works, in this paper, it is planned to investigate the dynamics of nonlinear processes of supercontinuum generation (SCG) in liquid-ﬁlled PCF (LCPCF) to understand the physical phenomena of femtosecond pulse propagation, particularly, the temporal and spectral changes of the pulse propagating through speciﬁc PCFs. Since the CS$_2$-ﬁlled LCPCF has complex nonlinear phenomena, we intend to analyse the role of saturable nonlinear response and slow nonlinear response on SCG in detail. For the physical explanation, soliton ﬁssion and modulational instability techniques will be implemented to investigate the impact of slow nonlinear response and saturable nonlinear response respectively, in SCG process.</p>

				<feature>Nonlinear Waves and Solitons</feature>
				<page>0975-0986</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study of the dynamics of 1D chains with both harmonic and nonlinear interactions, as in the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam (FPU) and related problems, has played a central role in efforts to identify the broad consequences of nonlinearity in these systems. Here we study the dynamics of highly localized excitations, or discrete breathers, which are known to be initiated by the quasistatic stretching of bonds between adjacent particles. We show via dynamical simulations that acoustic waves introduced by the harmonic term stabilize the discrete breather by suppressing the breather’s tendency to delocalize and disperse. We conclude that the harmonic term, and hence acoustic waves, are essential for the existence of localized breathers in these systems.</p>

				<title>Flip-ﬂop between soft-spring and hard-spring bistabilities in the approximated Toda oscillator analysis</title>
				<feature>Nonlinear Waves and Solitons</feature>
				<page>0987-1005</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study theoretically the effect of truncating the nonlinear restoring force (exp $(\Phi)−1 = \Sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \Phi^n/n!$) in the bistability pattern of the periodically driven, damped one-degree-of-freedom Toda oscillator that originally exhibits soft-spring bistability with counterclockwise hysteresis cycle. We observe that if the truncation is made third order, the harmonic bistability changes to hard-spring type with a clockwise hysteresis cycle. In contrast, for the fourth-order truncation, the bistability again becomes soft-spring type, overriding the effect of third-order nonlinearity. Furthermore, each higher odd-order truncation attempts to introduce hard-spring nature while each even-order truncation turns to soft-spring type of bistability. Overall, the hard-spring effect of every odd-order nonlinear term is weaker in comparison to the soft-spring effect of the next even-order nonlinear term. As a consequence, higher-order approximations ultimately converge to the soft-spring nature. Similar approximate analysis of Toda lattice has in recent past revealed remarkably similar ﬂip-ﬂop pattern between stochasticity (chaotic behaviour) and regularity (integrability).</p>

				<title>Thermal conductivity of nonlinear waves in disordered chains</title>
				<feature>Nonlinear Waves and Solitons</feature>
				<page>1007-1014</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present computational data on the thermal conductivity of nonlinear waves in disordered chains. Disorder induces Anderson localization for linear waves and results in a vanishing conductivity. Cubic nonlinearity restores normal conductivity, but with a strongly temperature-dependent conductivity $\kappa (T)$. We ﬁnd indications for an asymptotic low-temperature $\kappa \sim T^4$ and intermediate temperature $\kappa \sim T^2$ laws. These ﬁndings are in accord with theoretical studies of wave packet spreading, where a regime of strong chaos is found to be intermediate, followed by an asymptotic regime of weak chaos (Laptyeva $\textit{et al, Europhys. Lett}$. ${\bf 91}$, 30001 (2010)).</p>

				<title>A stepwise planned approach to the solution of Hilbert’s sixth problem. III: Measurements and von Neumann projection/collapse rule</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1031-1051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Supmech, the universal mechanics developed in the previous two papers (Dass, arXiv: 0909.4606[math-ph]; 1002:2061[math-ph]), accommodates both quantum and classical mechanics as subdisciplines (a brief outline is included for completeness); this feature facilitates, in a supmechbased treatment of quantum measurements, an unambiguous treatment of the apparatus as a quantum system approximated well by a classical one. Taking explicitly into consideration the fact that observations on the apparatus are made when it has ‘settled down after the measurement interaction’ and are restricted to macroscopically distinguishable pointer readings, the unwanted superpositions of (system $+$ apparatus) states are shown to be suppressed; this provides a genuinely physics-based justiﬁcation for the (traditionally postulated) von Neumann projection/collapse rule. The decoherence mechanism brought into play by the stated observational constraints is free from the objections against the traditional decoherence program.</p>

				<title>Properties of light ﬂavour baryons in hypercentral quark model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1053-1067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The light ﬂavour baryons are studied within the quark model using the hypercentral description of the three-body system. The conﬁnement potential is assumed as hypercentral Coulomb plus power potential (hCPP$_\nu$ ) with power index $\nu$. The masses and magnetic moments of light ﬂavour baryons are computed for different power indices, $\nu$, starting from 0.5 to 1.5. The predicted masses and magnetic moments are found to attain a saturated value with respect to variation in $\nu$ beyond the power index $\nu &#62; 1.0$. Further, we computed transition magnetic moments and radiative decay width of light ﬂavour baryons. The results are in good agreement with the known experimental as well as other theoretical models.</p>

					<p>Kaon nucleon elastic scattering is studied using chiral $SU(3)$ quark model including antiquarks. Parameters of the present model are essentially based on nucleon–nucleon and nucleon–hyperon interactions. The mass of the scalar meson $\sigma$ is taken as 635 MeV. Using this model, the phase shifts of the $S$ and $P$ partial waves of the kaon nucleon elastic scattering are investigated for isospins 0 and 1.

					<p>Chromomagnetic and chromoelectric dipole interactions of the top quark are studied in a model-independent framework. Limits are set on the scale of new physics that might lead to such contributions using latest Tevatron measurements of the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section. It is demonstrated that the invariant mass distribution is a sensitive probe. Prospects at the LHC are examined. It is shown that, for unitarized amplitudes, an increase in the LHC energy is of little importance, while the accumulation of luminosity plays a crucial role.</p>

					<p>We present the results of elliptic ﬂow for the collision of nearly symmetric nuclei (${}_{10}Ne^{20} + {}_{13}Al^{27}, {}_{18}Ar^{40} + {}_{21}Sc^{45}, {}_{30}Zn^{64} + {}_{28}Ni^{58}, {}_{36}Kr^{86} + {}_{41}Nb^{93}$) using the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model. General features of elliptic ﬂow are investigated with the help of theoretical simulations. The simulations are performed at beam energies between 45 and 105 MeV/nucleon. A signiﬁcant change can be seen from in-plane to out-of-plane elliptic ﬂow of different fragments with incident energy. A comparison with experimental data is also made. Further, we show that elliptic ﬂow for different fragments follows power-law dependence as given by the function $C(A_{\text{tot}})^{\tau}$.</p>

				<title>Canonical form of Nambu–Poisson bracket: A pedestrian approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1105-1117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the seventies, Nambu (Phys. Rev. ${\bf D7}$, 2405 (1973)) proposed a new approach to classical dynamics based on an $N$-dimensional Nambu–Poisson (NP) manifold replacing the primitive even-dimensional Poisson manifold and on $N–1$ Hamiltonians in place of a single Hamiltonian. This approach has had many promoters including Bayen and Flato (Phys. Rev. ${\bf D11}$, 3049 (1975)), Mukunda and Sudarshan (Phys. Rev. {\bf D13}, 2846 (1976)), and Takhtajan (Comm. Math. Phys. {\bf 160}, 295 (1994)) among others. While Nambu had originally considered $N = 3$, the illustration of his ideas for $N = 4$ and 6 was  given by Chatterjee  (Lett. Math. Phys. {\bf 36}, 117 (1996)) who observed that the classical description of dynamical systems having dynamical symmetries is described elegantly by Nambu’s formalism of mechanics. However, his considerations do not quite yield the beautiful canonical form conjectured by Nambu himself for the $N$-ary NP bracket. By making a judicious choice for the ‘extra constant of motion’ of namely, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which are the orientation angles in Kepler problem and isotropic harmonic oscillator (HO) respectively, we show that the dynamical systems with dynamical symmetries can be recast in the beautiful form suggested by Nambu. We believe that the techniques used and the theorems suggested by us in this work are of general interest because of their involvement in the transition from Hamiltonian mechanics to Nambu mechanics.</p>

					<p>Spectroscopic properties of praseodymium ions-doped erbium oxalate ($Er_2(C_2O_4)_3 \cdot nH_2O$) crystals have been investigated. The crystals were grown by hydro silica gel method under suitable pH conditions and by single diffusion method. The well-grown crystals are bright and transparent. The dark green colour of these crystals changes with the variation of the concentrations of the dopant ions. The absorption spectra have been measured in the region 200–800 nm at room temperature. Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters for f–f transitions of the $Pr^{3+}$ ions have been determined as $\Omega_2 = 166.7$, $\Omega_4 = 1.103$ and $\Omega_6 = 2.898$. Analyses of the absorption spectra also show a possible energy transfer from the host material to the dopant.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A scheme is proposed for achieving a controlled phase gate using interaction between atomic spin dipoles. Further, the spin states are prepared in coherent population trap states (CPTs), which are robust against perturbations, laser ﬂuctuations etc. We show that one-qubit and two-qubit operations can easily be obtained in this scheme. The scheme is also robust against decoherences due to spontaneous emissions as the CPT states used are dressed states formed out of Zeeman sublevels of ground states of the bare atom. However, certain practical issues are of concern in actually obtaining the scheme, which are also discussed at the end of this paper.</p>

					<p>A tokamak plasma discharge having an increase in duration accompanied with enhanced runaway electron ﬂux has been experimentally studied in this paper. The discharges have been obtained by controlling the applied vertical magnetic ﬁeld ($B^{\text{appl}}_v$) to below a critical value. Such discharges have been observed to have ‘negative edge plasma currents’, detected using an internal Rogowskii coil (IRC). We have tried to correlate the runaway behaviour with the negative edge plasma currents and have explained that these observations are a result of beam plasma instabilities.</p>

The value of the adhesion energy for liquid xenon at a reduced density of 0.630 was found to be 0.591 J/m$^2$ and the surface traction has a peak at $z = 3.32 Å$. It was observed that the attraction of the molecules in the liquid surface which produces a resistance to penetration decreases with temperature. This may be attributed to the greater average separation of molecules at higher temperature.</p>

				<title>Schwarzian derivative as a proof of the chaotic behaviour</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1159-1169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, a sufﬁcient condition for determining chaotic behaviours of the nonlinear systems has been characterized by the negative Schwarzian derivative (Hacıbekiroğlu et al, Nonlinear Anal.: Real World Appl. {\bf 10}, 1270 (2009)). In this work, the Schwarzian derivative has been calculated for investigating the quantum chaotic transition points in the high-temperature superconducting frame of reference, which is known as a nonlinear dynamical system that displays some macroscopic quantum effects. In our previous works, two quantum chaotic transition points of the critical transition temperature, $T_c$, and paramagnetic Meissner transition temperature, $T_{\text{PME}}$, have been phenomenologically predicted for the mercury-based high-temperature superconductors (Onbaşlı et al, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals {\bf 42}, 1980 (2009); Aslan et al, J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. {\bf 153}, 012002 (2009); Çataltepe, Superconductor (Sciyo Company, India, 2010)). The $T_c$, at which the one-dimensional global gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken, refers to the second-order phase transition, whereas the $T_{\text{PME}}$, at which time reversal symmetry is broken, indicates the change in the direction of orbital current in the system (Onbaşlı et al, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals {\bf 42}, 1980 (2009)). In this context, the chaotic behaviour of the mercury-based high-temperature superconductors has been investigated by means of the Schwarzian derivative of the magnetic moment versus temperature. In all calculations, the Schwarzian derivatives have been found to be negative at both $T_c$ and $T_{\text{PME}}$ which are in agreement with the chaotic behaviour of the system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>ZnO thin ﬁlms of different thicknesses were prepared by thermal evaporation on glass substrates at room temperature. Deposition process was carried out in a vapour pressure of about $5.54 \times 10^{-5}$ mbar. The substrate–target distance was kept constant during the process. By XRD and AFM techniques the microstructural characteristics and their changes with variation in thickness were studied. Electrical resistivity and conductivity of samples vs. temperature were investigated by four-probe method. It was shown that an increase in thickness causes a decrease in activation energy.</p>

				<title>Grazing incidence polarized neutron scattering in reﬂection geometry from nanolayered spintronic systems</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0001-0058</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This review summarizes recent experimental investigations using neutron scattering on layered nanomagnetic systems (accentuating my contribution), which have applications in spintronics also. Polarized neutron investigations of such artiﬁcially structured materials are basically done to understand the interplay between structure and magnetism conﬁned within the nanometer scale that can be additionally depth-resolved. Details of the identiﬁcation of buried domains and their nature of lateral and vertical correlations within the systems are important. A particularly interesting aspect that has emerged over the years is the capability to measure polarized neutron scattering in directions parallel and perpendicular to the applied ﬁeld direction (which is also the quantization axis for neutron polarizations). This was added with the capability of measuring in specular as well as in off-specular geometry. Distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) theory for neutrons has proved to be a remarkable development in the quantitative analysis of the scattering data measured simultaneously for specular and off-specular modes within the same framework. In particular, the depth and lateral distribution of the ferromagnetic spins relative to the interface within interlayercoupled or exchange-coupled system has been extensive. For example, twisted magnetization state at interlayer coupled interfaces or intricacies of symmetric and asymmetric magnetization reversals along with suppression of training effect in exchange coupled system was microscopically identiﬁed using neutron scattering only. The investigation on the distribution of magnetic species within dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor superlattices, with low angle neutron scattering, has played a crucial role both from practical and fundamental research points of view.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Eu ions conﬁned in an RF quadrupole trap, has been optically detected. Using a tunable dye laser which is pumped by a Nd-YAG pulsed laser system, the resonance ${}^9S_4–6 p_{3/2}$, $J = 5$ transition of the Eu ions have been excited and the resulting ﬂuorescence to the metastable ${}^9 D_{4−6}$ state has been detected. In preparation to determine the ground-state hyperﬁne splitting of the odd isotopes we found the optimum trapping operating point. We have also observed a number of instabilities inside the region of the stability for an ideal trap. These non-linear resonances arise from higher-order contributions to the ideal quadrupole potential.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The pattern formation in reaction–diffusion systems was studied by invoking the provisions contained in the moving boundary model. The model claims that the phase separation mechanism is responsible for separating the colloidal phase of precipitants into band and non-band regions. The relation between the band separation and its width are invariably related to the concentration of the reacting components. It was observed that this model provides critical condition for the band formation in semi-idealized diffusion systems. An algorithm for generating the band structure was designed, and the simulated pattern shows a close resemblance with the experimentally observed ones.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Hall mobility of InN$_x$As$_{1−x}$ semiconductor alloys is calculated by solving the Boltzmann transport equation using the iterative method. All the major scattering mechanisms are included in the calculations. The Hall mobilities of InAs and InN$_{0.01}$As$_{0.99}$ are presented in the temperature range of 30–600 K. It is shown that incorporation of even small amount of nitrogen leads to an abrupt reduction of the Hall mobility in InN$_x$As$_{1−x}$ at low temperatures. The effect of alloy random scattering on the Hall mobility of InN$_x$As$_{1−x}$ is examined at 77 and 300 K as the mole fraction x varies from 0.0 to 0.1. It is seen that the Hall mobility drops sharply up to $x = 0.02$ for 77 K and reduces slowly as the temperature increases to 300 K compared to 77 K. The Hall mobilities calculated theoretically are compared with the experimental data available in the literature.</p>

					<p>In this study, the octonion algebra and its general properties are deﬁned by the Cayley–Dickson’s multiplication rules for octonion units. The ﬁeld equations, potential equations and Maxwell equations for electromagnetism are investigated with the octonionic equations and these equations can be compared with their vectorial representations. The potential and wave equations for ﬁelds with sources are also provided. By using Maxwell equations, a Lorenz-like condition is newly suggested for electromagnetism. The existing equations including the photon mass provide the most acknowledged Lorenz condition for the magnetic monopole and the source.</p>

				<page>0175-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simple one-dimensional model for the system–apparatus interaction is analysed. The system is a spin-1/2 particle, and its position and momentum degrees constitute the apparatus. An analysis involving only unitary Schrödinger dynamics illustrates the nature of the correlations established in the system–apparatus entangled state. It is shown that even in the absence of any environment-induced decoherence, or any other measurement model, certain initial states of the apparatus – like localized Gaussian wavepackets – are preferred over others, in terms of measurementlike one-to-one correlations in the pure system–apparatus entangled state.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coupled discrete models abound in several areas of physics. Here we provide an extensive set of exact quasiperiodic solutions of a number of coupled discrete models in terms of Lamé polynomials of order one and two. Some of the models discussed are: (i) coupled Salerno model, (ii) coupled Ablowitz–Ladik model, (iii) coupled saturated discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation, (iv) coupled $\phi^4$ model and (v) coupled $\phi^6$ model. Furthermore, we show that most of these coupled models in fact also possess an even broader class of exact solutions.</p>

					<p>In this study, a coupled-channel (CC) analysis of the elastic and the inelastic scattering of 20.4 MeV polarized protons from a ${}^{64}$Zn target leading to the deformed $2^+$, $3^−$, $2^+_2$ states was performed. The CC potential parameters and the deformation parameters of the excited states corresponding to the best ﬁt to the experimental differential cross-sections and the analysing powers data were determined. For $2^+_2$ excited state, a mixed type was used and a good ﬁt to the data was provided. The CC calculation results were compared to the pure distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) calculation results which were calculated using the new parameters. All calculations were conducted using the computer code ECIS06.</p>

				<title>Physics design of a CW high-power proton Linac for accelerator-driven system</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0247-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Accelerator-driven systems (ADS) have evoked lot of interest the world over because of their capability to incinerate the MA (minor actinides) and LLFP (long-lived ﬁssion products) radiotoxic waste and their ability to utilize thorium as an alternative nuclear fuel. One of the main subsystems of ADS is a high energy ($\sim$1 GeV) and high current ($\sim$30 mA) CW proton Linac. The accelerator for ADS should have high efﬁciency and reliability and very low beam losses to allow hands-on maintenance. With these criteria, the beam dynamics simulations for a 1 GeV, 30 mA proton Linac has been done. The Linac consists of normal-conducting radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ), drift tube linac (DTL) and coupled cavity drift tube Linac (CCDTL) structures that accelerate the beam to about 100 MeV followed by superconducting (SC) elliptical cavities, which accelerate the beam from 100 MeV to 1 GeV. The details of the design are presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Induced photonuclear interaction by Rhodotron-TT200 10 MeV electron beam</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0257-0264</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper the photonuclear interaction induced by 10 MeV electron beam generating high-intensity neutrons is studied. Since the results depend on the target material, the calculations are performed for Pb, Ta and W targets which have high $Z$, in a simple geometry. MCNPX code has been used to simulate the whole process. Also, the results of photon generation has been compared with the experimental results to evaluate the reliability of the calculation. The results show that the obtained neutron ﬂux can reach up to 10$^{12}$ n/cm$^2$ /s with average energies of 0.9 MeV, 0.4 MeV and 0.9 MeV for these three elements respectively with the maximum heat deposited as 3000 W/c$^3$,4500 W/c$^3$ and 6000 W/c$^3$.</p>

				<title>Formation of multiple dark photovoltaic spatial solitons</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0265-0275</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We theoretically study the formation of multiple dark photovoltaic soliton splitting in the quasi-steady-state and steady-state regimes under open-circuit conditions. We ﬁnd that the initial width of the dark notch at the entrance face of the crystal is a key parameter for generating an even (or odd) number sequence of dark coherent photovoltaic solitons. If the initial width of the dark notch is small, only a fundamental soliton or Y-junction soliton pair is generated. As the initial width of the dark notch is increased, the dark notch tends to split into an odd (or even) number of multiple dark photovoltaic solitons, which realizes a progressive transition from a low-order soliton to a sequence of higher-order solitons. The soliton pairs far away from the centre have bigger width and less visibility. In addition, when the distance from the centre of the dark notch increases, the separations between adjacent dark stripes become slightly smaller.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report here an experimental study of the ionic keV X-ray line emission from magnesium plasma produced by laser pulses of three widely different pulse durations (FWHM) of 45 fs, 25 ps and 3 ns, at a constant laser ﬂuence of $\sim 1.5 \times 10^4$ J cm$^{−2}$. It is observed that the X-ray yield of the resonance lines from the higher ionization states such as H- and He-like ions decreases on decreasing the laser pulse duration, even though the peak laser intensities of $3.5 \times 10^{17}$ W cm$^{−2}$ for the 45 fs pulses and $6.2 \times 10^{14}$ W cm$^{−2}$ for the 25 ps pulses are much higher than $5 \times 10^{12}$ W cm$^{−2}$ for the 3 ns laser pulse. The results were explained in terms of the ionization equilibrium time for different ionization states in the heated plasma. The study can be useful to make optimum choice of the laser pulse duration to produce short pulse intense X-ray line emission from the plasma and to get the knowledge of the degree of ionization in the plasma.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The two-dimensional (2D) extended Falicov–Kimball model has been studied to observe the role of nonlocal Coulomb interaction ($U_{\text{nc}}$) using an exact diagonalization technique. The f-state occupation ($n^f$), the f–d intersite correlation function ($c_{\text{fd}}$), the speciﬁc heat ($C$), entropy ($S$) and the speciﬁc heat coefﬁcient ($\gamma$) have been examined. Nonlocal Coulomb interaction-induced discontinuous insulator-to-metal transition occurs at a critical f-level energy. More ordered state is obtained with the increase of $U_{\text{nc}}$. In the speciﬁc heat curves, two-peak structure as well as a singlepeak structure appears. At low-temperature region, a sharp rise in the speciﬁc heat coefﬁcient $\gamma$ is observed. The peak value of $\gamma$ shifts to the higher temperature region with $U_{\text{nc}}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thin ﬁlms of Se$_{85−x}$Te$_{15}$Zn$_x$ ($x = 0$, 2, 4, 6 and 10) glassy alloys have been deposited onto a chemically cleaned glass substrate by thermal evaporation technique under vacuum. The analysis of transmission spectra, measured at normal incidence, in the spectral range of 400–2500 nm helped us in the optical characterization of thin ﬁlms under study. From the analysis of transmission spectra, the optical parameters such as refractive index ($n$), extinction coefﬁcient ($k$), absorption coefﬁcient ($\alpha$), real and imaginary dielectric constants ($\epsilon'$ and $\epsilon"$) have been calculated. It is observed that the parameters $n$, $k$, $\epsilon'$, $\epsilon"$ and $\alpha$ decrease with increase in wavelength ($\lambda$) and increase with Zn content. Optical band gap ($E_g$) has also been calculated and found to decrease with Zn content in Se$_{85−x}$Te$_{15}$Zn$_x$ glassy system which could be correlated with increase in the density of defect states.</p>

				<title>Synthesis and nanostructural investigation of TiO$_2$ nanorods doped by SiO$_2$</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0319-0331</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>TiO$_2$ Nano rods can be used as dye-sensitized solar cells, various sensors and photocatalysts. These nanorods are synthesized by a hydrothermal corrosion process in NaOH solution at $200^{\circ}$C using  TiO$_2$ powder as the source material. In the present work, the synthesis of TiO$_2$ nanorods in anatase, rutile and Ti$_7$O$_{13}$ phases and synthesis of TiO$_2$ nanorods by incorporating SiO$_2$ dopant, using the sol–gel method and alkaline corrosion are reported. The morphologies and crystal structures of the TiO2 nanorods are characterized using ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The obtained results show not only an aggregation structure at high calcination temperatures with spherical particles but also Ti–O–Si bonds having four-fold coordination with oxygen in SiO$^{4−}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, we present a new and very accurate numerical method to approximate the Fisher’s-type equations. Firstly, the spatial derivative in the proposed equation is approximated by a sixth-order compact ﬁnite difference (CFD6) scheme. Secondly, we solve the obtained system of differential equations using a third-order total variation diminishing Runge–Kutta (TVD-RK3) scheme. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the efﬁciency of the proposed method.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear resonance in Dufﬁng oscillator with ﬁxed and integrative time-delayed feedbacks</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0347-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study the nonlinear resonance, one of the fundamental phenomena in nonlinear oscillators, in a damped and periodically-driven Dufﬁng oscillator with two types of time-delayed feedbacks, namely, ﬁxed and integrative. Particularly, we analyse the effect of the time-delay parameter $\alpha$ and the strength $\gamma$ of the time-delayed feedback. Applying the perturbation theory we obtain a nonlinear equation for the amplitude of the periodic response of the system. For a range of values of $\gamma$ and $\alpha$, the response amplitude is found to be higher than that of the system in the absence of delayed feedback. The response amplitude is periodic on the parameter $\alpha$ with period $2\pi /\omega$ where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the external periodic force. We show the occurrence of multiple branches of the response amplitude curve with and without hysteresis.</p>

				<title>Robust chaos synchronization based on adaptive fuzzy delayed feedback $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ control</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0361-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we propose a new adaptive $\mathcal_{\infty}$ synchronization strategy, called an adaptive fuzzy delayed feedback $\mathcal_{\infty}$ synchronization (AFDFHS) strategy, for chaotic systems with uncertain parameters and external disturbances. Based on Lyapunov–Krasovskii theory, Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model and adaptive delayed feedback $\mathcal_{\infty}$ control scheme, the AFDFHS controller is presented such that the synchronization error system is asymptotically stable with a guaranteed $\mathcal_{\infty}$ performance. It is shown that the design of the AFDFHS controller with adaptive law can be achieved by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI), which can be easily facilitated by using some standard numerical packages. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AFDFHS approach.</p>

				<title>Multiple ($G'/G$)-expansion method and its applications to nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0375-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, an extended multiple ($G'/G$)-expansion method is proposed to seek exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. The validity and advantages of the proposed method is illustrated by its applications to the Sharma–Tasso–Olver equation, the sixth-order Ramani equation, the generalized shallow water wave equation, the Caudrey–Dodd–Gibbon–Sawada–Kotera equation, the sixth-order Boussinesq equation and the Hirota–Satsuma equations. As a result, various complexiton solutions consisting of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, rational functions and their mixture with parameters are obtained. When some parameters are taken as special values, the known double solitary-like wave solutions are derived from the double hyperbolic function solution. In addition, this method can also be used to deal with some high-dimensional and variable coefﬁcients’ nonlinear evolution equations.</p>

					<p>We study the elastic scattering of atomic argon by electron in the presence of a bichromatic laser ﬁeld in the second Born approximation. The target atom is approximated by a simple screening potential and the continuum states of the impinging and emitting electrons are described as Volkov states.

				<abstract>
					<p>Polarization property is important to the optical imaging system. It has recently been understood that the polarization properties of light can be fruitfully used for improving the characteristics of imaging system that includes polarizing devices. The vector wave imagery lends an additional degree of freedom that can be utilized for obtaining results that are unobtainable in scalar wave imagery. This calls for a systematic study of diffraction properties of different apertures using polarization-sensitive devices. In the present paper, we have studied the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of slits masked by different kinds of polarizing devices which introduce a phase difference between the two orthogonal components of the incident beam.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The capability of various metals used in optical ﬁbre-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing is studied theoretically. Four metals, gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu) and aluminium (Al) are considered for the present study. The performance of the optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor with four different metals is obtained numerically and compared in detail. The performance of optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor has been analysed in terms of sensitivity, signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and quality parameter. It is found that the performance of optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor with Au metal is better than that of the other three metals. The sensitivity of the optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor with 50 nm thick and 10 mm long Au metal ﬁlm of exposed sensing region is 2.373 $\mu$m/RIU with good linearity, SNR is 0.724 and quality parameter is 48.281 RIU$^{−1}$. The thickness of the metal ﬁlm and the length of the exposed sensing region of the optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor for each metal are also optimized.</p>

					<p>The present note deals with the effects of radiative heat transfer and free convection in MHD for a ﬂow of an electrically conducting, incompressible, dusty viscous ﬂuid past an impulsively started vertical non-conducting plate, under the inﬂuence of transversely applied magnetic ﬁeld. The heat due to viscous dissipation and induced magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be negligible. The governing linear partial differential equations are solved by ﬁnite difference technique. The effects of various parameters (like radiation parameter $N$, Prandtl number Pr, porosity parameter $K$) entering into the MHD Stokes problem for ﬂow of dusty conducting ﬂuid have been examined on the temperature ﬁeld and velocity proﬁle for both the dusty ﬂuid and dust particles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The modulation instability of an intense circularly polarized laser beam propagating in an unmagnetized, cold electron–positron–ion plasma is investigated. Adopting a generalized Karpman method, a three-dimensional nonlinear equation is shown to govern the laser ﬁeld. Then the conditions for modulation instability and the temporal growth rate are obtained analytically. In order to compare with the usual electron–ion plasmas, the effect of positron concentration is considered. It is found that the increase in positron-to-electron density ratio shifts the instability region towards higher vertical wave numbers but does not cause displacement along the parallel wave number direction, and the growth rate increases as the positron-to-electron density ratio increases.</p>

					<p>The lifetimes of quantum excitations are directly related to the electron and phonon energy linewidths of a particular scattering event. Using the versatile double time thermodynamic Green’s function approach based on many-body theory, an ab-initio formulation of relaxation times of various contributing processes has been investigated with newer understanding in terms of the linewidths of electrons and phonons. The energy linewidth is found to be an extremely sensitive quantity in the transport phenomena of crystalline solids as a collection of large number of scattering processes, namely, boundary scattering, impurity scattering, multiphonon scattering, interference scattering, electron–phonon processes and resonance scattering. The lattice thermal conductivities of three samples of GaAs have been analysed on the basis of modiﬁed Callaway model and a fairly good agreement between theory and experimental observations has been reported.</p>

				<title>Electronic structures of the F-terminated AlN nanoribbons</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0469-0474</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the ﬁrst-principles calculations, electronic properties for the F-terminated AlN nanoribbons with both zigzag and armchair edges are studied. The results show that both the zigzag and armchair AlN nanoribbons are semiconducting and nonmagnetic, and the indirect band gap of the zigzag AlN nanoribbons and the direct band gap of the armchair ones decrease monotonically with increasing ribbon width. In contrast, the F-terminated AlN nanoribbons have narrower band gaps than those of the H-terminated ones when the ribbons have the same bandwidth. The densityof-states (DOS) and local density-of-states (LDOS) analyses show that the top of the valence band for the F-terminated ribbons is mainly contributed by N atoms, while at the side of the conduction band, the total DOS is mainly contributed by Al atoms. The charge density contour analyses show that Al–F bond is ionic because the electronegativity of F atom is much stronger for F atom than for Al atom, while N–F bond is covalent because of the combined action of the stronger electronegativity and the smaller covalent radius.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0475-0482</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The anisotropic $g$ factors and local structure for the trigonal Pt$^{3+}$ centre in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ are theoretically investigated from the perturbation formulas of the $g$ factors for a $5d^7$ ion in trigonal symmetry. The Pt$^{3+}$ impurity is found to experience an outward displacement by about 0.18 Å away from the centre of the oxygen octahedron along the $C_3$-axis. The calculated g factors based on the above axial displacement show good agreement with the observed values. Importantly, the pending problem of $+3$ valence state of the doped Pt in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is theoretically clariﬁed, and the possibility of Pt$^+$ ($5d^9$) is thus excluded in this work.</p>

				<title>Magnetic response of split-ring resonator metamaterials: From effective medium dispersion to photonic band gaps</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0483-0492</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>On systematically investigating the electromagnetic response of periodic split-ring resonator (SRR) metamaterials as a function of the size-to-wavelength ($a/\lambda$) ratio, we ﬁnd that the stop bands due to the geometric resonances of the SRR weaken with increasing ($a/\lambda$) ratio, and are eventually replaced by stop bands due to Bragg scattering. Our study traces the behaviour of SRR-based metamaterials as the resonance frequency increases and the wavelength of the radiation ﬁnally becomes comparable to the size of the unit cell of the metamaterial. In the intermediate stages, the dispersion of the SRR metamaterial can still be described as due to a localized magnetic resonances while Bragg scattering ﬁnally becomes the dominant phenomenon as $a/\lambda \sim 1/2$.</p>

				<title>Measurement of peak ﬂuence of neutron beams using Bi-ﬁssion detectors</title>
				<feature>Brief Report</feature>
				<page>0493-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fission fragments and other charged particles leave tracks of permanent damage in most of the insulating solids. Damage track detectors are useful for personal dosimeters and for ﬂux/dose determination of high-energy particles from accelerators or cosmic rays. A detector that has its principal response at nucleon energy above 50 MeV is provided by the ﬁssion of Bi-209. Neutrons produce the largest percentage of hadron dose in most high-energy radiation ﬁelds. In these ﬁelds, the neutron spectrum is typically formed by low-energy neutrons (evaporation spectrum) and high-energy neutrons (knock-on spectrum). We used Bi-ﬁssion detectors to measure neutron peak ﬂuence and compared the result with the calculated value of neutron peak ﬂuence. For the exposure to 100 MeV we have used the iThemba Facility in South Africa.</p>

				<title>Energy–momentum localization for Bianchi type-IV Universe in general relativity and teleparallel gravity</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0531-0548</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study we have investigated the energy–momentum distributions for homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-IV in B class Universe. For this purpose, we have used energy–momentum complexes of Einstein, Bergmann–Thomson, Landau–Lifshitz (LL), Papapetrou, Tolman and Møller in general relativity (GR) as also Einstein, Bergmann–Thomson, Landau–Lifshitz and Møller in teleparallel gravity (TG). From the obtained results we have found that Einstein and Bergmann–Thomson distributions are exactly giving the same results in GR and TG but the Landau–Lifshitz, Papapetrou Tolman and Møller energy–momentum distributions do not provide the same results with Einstein and Bergmann–Thomson in GR and TG. Furthermore, Einstein, Bergmann–Thomson and LL results are the same in different gravitation theories and we get that both GR and TG are equivalent theories for these prescriptions. From the obtained solutions, we could say that these are equivalent theories. Also, Møller energy–momentum distributions do not give the same results in GR and TG. However, we have found that all energy prescriptions are negative and our results agree with Nester et al.</p>

					<p>We deﬁne a nonlinear model for fractional relaxation phenomena. We use $\epsilon$-expansion method to analyse this model. By studying the fundamental solutions of this model we ﬁnd that when $t \to 0$ the model exhibits a fast decay rate and when $t \to \infty$ the model exhibits a power-law decay.

					<p>The proposed high current injector for the superconducting Linac at the InterUniversity Accelerator Centre will have several accelerating structures, including a superconducting module which will contain low beta niobium resonators. A prototype resonator for the low beta module has been designed. The resonator has been carefully modelled to optimize the electromagnetic parameters. In order to validate them, a room-temperature copper model has been built and tested. In this paper we present details of the electromagnetic design of the low beta resonator, brieﬂy discuss the mechanical and engineering design, and present results from the measurements on the room-temperature copper model.</p>

				<title>Light squeezing in optical parametric ampliﬁcation beyond the slowly-varying amplitude approximation</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0595-0612</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optical parametric ampliﬁcation (OPA) described usually by the coupled-wave equations with the ﬁrst-order derivatives of the signal and idler waves, is solved under the slowly-varying amplitude approximation (SVA). In this article, by keeping the second-order derivatives in the coupled-wave equations, we obtained an analytical solution for the output signal and idler waves up to the ﬁrst order of $(\kappa/k)^1$; the ratio of coupling constant to the wave number. Furthermore, here the signal and the idler waves are distinguished only by their polarizations with the same frequency. Light squeezing is observed in normally ordered variances of the two quadrature operators of the output combined mode when plotted against $\kappa L$, where $\kappa$ is the coupling constant and $L$ the interaction length. The variances have different signs for a range of values of $\kappa L$ and their variations are in opposite directions. We also show that this property is strongly dependent on the relative refractive index of the medium ($n$). It is worth mentioning that the relative index dependency is not an explicit feature in squeezing of OPA under SVA approximation. Furthermore, the squeezing vanishes when $n  \to  1$ and $\kappa /k \to 0$.</p>

				<title>Three-dimensional simulation of laser–plasma-based electron acceleration</title>

				<page>0613-0623</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A sequential three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell simulation code PICPSI-3D with a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed and used to study the interaction of plasma with ultrahigh intensity laser radiation. A case study of laser–plasma-based electron acceleration has been carried out to assess the performance of this code. Simulations have been performed for a Gaussian laser beam of peak intensity $5 \times 10^{19}$ W/cm$^2$ propagating through an underdense plasma of uniform density $1 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{−3}$, and for a Gaussian laser beam of peak intensity $1.5 \times 10^{19}$ W/cm$^2$ propagating through an underdense plasma of uniform density $3.5 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{−3}$. The electron energy spectrum has been evaluated at different time-steps during the propagation of the laser beam. When the plasma density is $1 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{−3}$, simulations show that the electron energy spectrum forms a monoenergetic peak at $\sim 14$ MeV, with an energy spread of $\pm 7$ MeV. On the other hand, when the plasma density is $3.5 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{−3}$, simulations show that the electron energy spectrum forms a monoenergetic peak at $\sim 23$ MeV, with an energy spread of $\pm 7.5$ MeV.</p>

				<title>Determination of the optimal parameters for the fabrication of ZnO thin ﬁlms prepared by spray pyrolysis method</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0625-0634</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, ZnO thin ﬁlms have been prepared by spray pyrolysis deposition method on the glass substrates. The effect of deposition parameters, such as deposition rate, substrate temperature and solution volume has been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, UV–Vis–NIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrical measurements. The XRD patterns indicate polycrystalline wurtzite structure with preferred direction along (0 0 2) planes. Thin ﬁlms have transparency around 90&#37; in the visible range. The optical band gap was determined at 3.27 eV which did not change signiﬁcantly. Evolution of electrical results containing the carriers' density, sheet resistance and resistivity are in agreement with structural results. All the results suggest the best deposition parameters are: deposition rate, $R = 3$ ml/min, substrate temperature, $T_s = 450^{\circ}$C and thickness of the thin ﬁlms $t = 110–130$ nm.</p>

				<title>Thermal conductivity of large-grain niobium and its effect on trapped vortices in the temperature range 1.8–5 K</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0635-0649</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Experimental investigation of the thermal conductivity of large grain and its dependence on the trapped vortices in parallel magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the temperature gradient $\nabla T$ was carried out on four large-grain niobium samples from four different ingots. The zero-ﬁeld thermal conductivity measurements are in good agreement with the measurements based on the theory of Bardeen–Rickayzen–Tewordt (BRT). The change in thermal conductivity with trapped vortices is analysed with the ﬁeld dependence of the conductivity results of Vinen et al for low inductions and low-temperature situation. Finally, the dependence of thermal conductivity on the applied magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the upper critical ﬁeld $H_{c2}$ is ﬁtted with the theory of pure type-II superconductor of Houghton and Maki. Initial remnant magnetization in the sample shows a departure from the Houghton–Maki curve whereas the sample with zero trapped ﬂux qualitatively agrees with the theory. A qualitative discussion is presented explaining the reason for such deviation from the theory. It has also been observed that if the sample with the trapped vortices is cycled through $T_c$, the subsequent measurement of the thermal conductivity coincides with the zero trapped ﬂux results.</p>

				<title>String cosmology in LRS Bianchi type-II dusty Universe with time-decaying vacuum energy density $\Lambda$</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0651-0665</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A model of a cloud formed by massive strings is used as a source of LRS Bianchi type-II with time-decaying vacuum energy density $\Lambda$. To construct string cosmological models, we have used the energy–momentum tensor for such strings as formulated by Letelier (1983). The high nonlinear ﬁeld equations have been solved for two types of strings: (i) massive string and (ii) Nambu string. The expansion $\theta$ in the model is assumed to be proportional to the shear $\sigma$. This condition leads to $A = \beta B^m$, where $A$ and $B$ are the metric coefﬁcients, $m$ is a constant and $\beta$ is an integrating constant. Our models are in accelerating phase which is consistent with the recent observations of supernovae type-Ia. The physical and geometrical behaviour of these models are also discussed.</p>

Speciﬁc results are presented for (i) the hydrogen atom and (ii) an isotropic harmonic oscillator. The dimensionality of the problem is seen to enter into these relations in such a way that one can immediately verify the corresponding three-dimensional results.

					<p>We study static spherically symmetric spacetime to describe compact objects with anisotropic matter distribution. We express the system of Einstein ﬁeld equations as a new system of differential equations using a coordinate transformation, and then write the system in another form with polytropic equation of state and obtain two classes of exact models. The models satisfy all major physical features expected in a realistic star. For polytropic index $n = 2$, we obtain expressions for mass and density which are comparable with the reported experimental observations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the context of $f (R)$ theories of gravity, we address the problem of ﬁnding a rotating charged black hole solution in the case of constant curvature. A new metric is obtained by solving the ﬁeld equations and we show that its behaviour is typical of a rotating charged source. In addition, we analyse the thermodynamics of the new black hole. The results ensure that the thermodynamical properties in $f (R)$ gravities are qualitatively similar to those of standard General Relativity.</p>

We characterize the rich variety of dynamical states emerging from the model under variation of time delay in coupling, coupling strength and boundary conditions. The spatiotemporal patterns obtained include clustering, mixed dynamics, inhomogeneous steady states and amplitude death.

					<p>The nucleation rate of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) droplet is computed at ﬁnite quark chemical potential. In the course of computing the nucleation rate, the ﬁnite size effects of the QGP droplet are taken into account. We consider the phenomenological ﬂow parameter of quarks and gluons, which is dependent on quark chemical potential and we calculate the nucleation rate of the QGP droplet with this parameter. While calculating the nucleation rate, we ﬁnd that for low values of quark phenomenological parameter $\gamma q$, nucleation rate is negligible and when $\gamma_q$ increases, nucleation rate increases signiﬁcantly.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The nucleon momentum distributions (NMD) and elastic electron scattering form factors of the ground state for 1p-shell nuclei with $Z = N$ (such as ${}^6$Li, ${}^{10}$B, ${}^{12}$C and ${}^{14}$N nuclei) have been calculated in the framework of the coherent density ﬂuctuation model (CDFM) and expressed in terms of the weight function $|f(x)|^2$. The weight function has been expressed in terms of nucleon density distribution (NDD) of the nuclei and determined from the theory and the experiment. The feature of the long-tail behaviour at high-momentum region of the NMDs has been obtained by both the theoretical and experimental weight functions. The experimental form factors $F(q)$ of all the considered nuclei are very well reproduced by the present calculations for all values of momentum transfer $q$. It is found that the contributions of the quadrupole form factors $F_{C2}(q)$ in ${}^{10}$B and ${}^{14}$N nuclei, which are described by the undeformed p-shell model, are essential for obtaining a remarkable agreement between the theoretical and experimental form factors.</p>

Crystalline zinc oxide nanoparticles are synthesized using single-step chemical method while the nanoﬂuids are prepared by the dispersion of nanoparticles in PVA solution using an ultrasonicator. The prepared nanoparticles are characterized using X-ray diffraction, SEM–EDX and UV–visible spectrum. The particle size distribution measurement is carried out by acoustic particle sizer. The ultrasonic velocities are measured in the synthesized nanoﬂuid under different physical conditions using an ultrasonic interferometer. It is found that the degree of crystallinity of nanoparticles depends on the evaporation rate during its synthesis and ultrasonic velocity has non-linear relation with temperature for the present nanoﬂuid.</p>

					<p>In this paper, the quantum properties of a two-level atom and the cavity-ﬁeld in the Jaynes–Cummings model with the gravity beyond the rotating wave approximation are investigated. For this purpose, by solving the Schrödinger equation in the interaction picture, the evolving state of the system is found by which the inﬂuence of the counter-rotating terms on the dynamical behaviour of atomic population inversion and the probability distribution of the cavity-ﬁeld as quantum properties is explored. The results in the atom–ﬁeld system beyond the rotating wave approximation with the gravity show that the quantum properties are not completely suppressed under certain conditions.</p>

				<title>Relativistic effects on the modulational instability of electron plasma waves in quantum plasma</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0779-0790</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relativistic effects on the linear and nonlinear properties of electron plasma waves are investigated using the one-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model for a twocomponent electron–ion dense quantum plasma. Using standard perturbation technique, a nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) containing both relativistic and quantum effects has been derived. This equation has been used to discuss the modulational instability of the wave. Through numerical calculations it is shown that relativistic effects signiﬁcantly change the linear dispersion character of the wave. Unlike quantum effects, relativistic effects are shown to reduce the instability growth rate of electron plasma waves.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Single crystals of a novel compound, bis(ethyltriphenylphosphonium) tetrabromomanganate(II) dihydrate (BTP-Mn) were grown by solution growth-slow evaporation technique from aqueous solution of the compound at ambient temperature. The grown crystals were characterized by elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques. The chemical composition of the compound was revealed by elemental analysis and its crystallinity was conﬁrmed by powder X-ray diffraction. Thermal analysis conﬁrmed that the compound was stable up to $125^\circ$C. The various kinds of protons and carbons present in the compound were conﬁrmed by ${}^1$H NMR and ${}^{13}$C NMR technique respectively and the presence of phosphorous was conﬁrmed by ${}^{31}$P NMR spectrum in the compound. The modes of vibration of different molecular groups present in the compound were identiﬁed by FTIR spectral analysis. The second harmonic generation behaviour was tested by Nd:YAG laser source.</p>

					<p>We obtained an approximation of the force ﬁeld of $\alpha$-quartz crystal using a new idea of applying density functional theory [J Purton, R Jones, C R A Catlow and M Leslie, Phys. Chem.

				<abstract>
					<p>Design of self-correction coils in a superferric dipole magnet is carried out. By adopting the self-correction coil (SCC) scheme, we can do online correction of unwanted ﬁelds inside the magnet aperture during the whole operating cycle irrespective of their origin. The self-correction coils are short-circuited superconducting coils of required symmetry placed in the useful aperture of the AC dipole magnet. Design and operation mechanism of self-correction coils in a superferric dipole magnet are discussed in this paper.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we consider a model of interacting phantom and Yang–Mills (YM) ﬁelds by assuming dilaton-type coupling. Using the speciﬁc solution for YM equation previously found by the author, we obtain simple exact solutions for the accelerated expansion of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmological model. Besides, we derive induced potentials of phantom ﬁeld corresponding to some given regimes of expansion. The effective equations of state (EoS) have been reconstructed for all types of models considered here.</p>

				<title>Effect of conduction band nonparabolicity on the optical properties in a single quantum well under hydrostatic pressure and electric ﬁeld</title>
				<feature>Brief Report</feature>
				<page>0827-0833</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of conduction band nonparabolicity on the linear and nonlinear optical properties such as absorption coefﬁcients, and changes in the refractive index are calculated in the Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As/GaAs heterostructure-based symmetric rectangular quantum well under applied hydrostatic pressure and electric ﬁeld. The electron envelope functions and energies are calculated in the effective mass equation including the conduction band nonparabolicity. The linear and nonlinear optical properties have been calculated in the density matrix formalism with two-level approximation. The conduction band nonparabolicity shifts the positions of the optical properties and decreases their strength compared to those without this correction. Both the optical properties are enhanced with the applied hydrostatic pressure. While the absorption coefﬁcients are bleached under the combined effect of high pressure and electric ﬁeld, the bleaching effect is reduced when nonparabolicity is included.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Prehistory – Starting from ’t Hooft’s (1971) we have a short look at Taylor’s and Slavnov’s works (1971–72) and at the lectures given by Rouet and Stora in Lausanne (1973) which determine the transition from pre-history to history.</p>
					<p>History – We give a brief account of the main analyses and results of the BRS collaboration concerning the renormalized gauge theories, in particular the method of the regularization-independent, algebraic renormalization, the algebraic proof of {\bf S}-matrix unitarity and that of gauge choice independence of the renormalized physics. We conclude this report with a suggestion to the crucial question: what could remain of BRS invariance beyond perturbation theory.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0865-0874</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the transport of a tracer particle through the Bose–Einstein condensate of a Bose gas. The particle interacts with the atoms in the Bose gas through two-body interactions. In the limiting regime where the particle is very heavy and the Bose gas is very dense, but very weakly interacting (‘mean-ﬁeld limit’), the dynamics of this system corresponds to classical Hamiltonian dynamics. We show that, in this limit, the particle is decelerated by emission of gapless modes into the condensate (Cerenkov radiation). For an ideal gas, the particle eventually comes to rest. In an interacting Bose gas, the particle is decelerated until its speed equals the propagation speed of the Goldstone modes of the condensate. This is a model of ‘Hamiltonian friction’. It is also of interest in connection with the phenomenon of ‘decoherence’ in quantum mechanics. This note is based on work we have carried out in collaboration with D Egli, I M Sigal and A Soffer.</p>

				<title>Charting the invisible in phase space (Abstract only)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0891-0891</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One challenge in particle physics is that not all the momenta relevant to many processes are observable. Some particles are nearly invisible (neutrinos and hypothetical neutralinos), others escape undetected down the beam pipes of colliders. One faces the task of extracting the maximum information (e.g. on the mass of the unobserved particles) from a set of more unknowns than constraining energy–momentum conservation equations. We study the simplest realistic case of current interest: single-$W$ production at a hadron collider, followed by its leptonic decay. We derive and discuss the statistically-optimal ‘singularity variable’ relevant to the measurement of the $W$ mass. In spite of its simplicity, this process is fairly non-trivial and constitutes a good ‘training’ example for the scrutiny of phenomena involving invisible objects. Our graphical analysis of the phase space is akin to that of a Dalitz plot, extended to such processes.</p>

					<p>A novel hyperchaotic system is proposed. It is particularly interesting that the hyperchaotic system has a nonlinear term in the form of an exponential function and has onle one equilibrium. Basic dynamical properties of the hyperchaotic system are investigated. Moreover, antisynchronization of the new hyperchaotic system with parameter mismatch and external disturbances is also studied in this paper by using adaptive control.

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we present the results obtained from first-principles calculations of the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the strucural, elastic and electronic properties of (B3) boron phosphide, using the pseudopotential plane-wave method (PP-PW) based on density functional theory within the Teter and Pade exchange-correlation functional form of the local density approximation (LDA). The lattice parameter, molecular and crystal densities, near-neighbour distances, independent elastic constant, bulk modulus, shear modulus, anisotropy factor and energy bandgaps of (B3) BP under high pressure are presented. The results showed a phase transition pressure from the zinc blende to rock-salt phase at around 1.56 Mbar, which is in good agreement with the theoretical data reported in the literature.</p>

					<p>Using ensemble Monte Carlo simulation technique, we have calculated the transport properties of InN such as the drift velocity, the drift mobility, the average electron, energy relaxation times and momentum relaxation times at high electric ﬁeld. The scattering mechanisms included are polar optical phonon, ionized impurity, acoustic phonon and intervalley phonon. It is found that the maximum peak velocity only occurs when the electric ﬁeld is increased to a value above a certain critical ﬁeld. This critical ﬁeld is strongly dependent on InN parameters. The steady-state transport parameters are in fair agreement with other recent calculations.</p>

				<title>The relationship between the doping levels and some physical properties of SnO$_{2}$:F thin ﬁlms spray-deposited on optical glass</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0137-0150</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relationship between the ﬂuorine doping level and the electrical, structural and optical properties of the SnO$_{2}$:F ﬁlms are investigated using the Hall effect measurement set-up in van der Pauw conﬁguration, the XRD patterns, UV–vis spectrophotometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The X-ray diffraction patterns taken at room temperature show that the ﬁlms are polycrystalline. The preferred directions of crystal growth in the diffractogram of SnO$_{2}$:F (FTO) ﬁlms correspond to the reﬂections from the (1 1 0), (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (3 0 1) planes. Thin ﬁlm thickness and the grain size vary from 280 to 1545 nm and from 17.45 to 33.22 nm, respectively. AFM study reveals the surface of FTO to be made of nanocrystalline particles. The electrical study reveals that the ﬁlms are degenerate and exhibit n-type electrical conductivity. The FTO ﬁlms have a minimum resistivity of $5.29 × 10^{−4} \Omega$·cm, carrier density of $0.09 × 10^{20}$ cm$^{−3}$ and mobility of 377.02 cm$^{2}$/V·s. The sprayed FTO ﬁlm has the minimum sheet resistance of 5.69 $\Omega$ /cm$^{2}$ and the highest ﬁgure-of-merit of $204 × 10^{−4} \Omega^{−1}$ at 700 nm. The resistivity attained for the doped ﬁlm in this study is lower than the values reported for 20 wt.$\%$ ﬂuorine-doped tin oxide ﬁlms prepared from the aqueous solution of SnCl$_{2}$·2H$_{2}$O precursor. The highest visible transmittance (700 nm) of the deposited ﬁlms is 91.8$\%$ for 25 wt.$\%$ ﬂuorine-doped tin oxide ﬁlms. The obtained results reveal that the structures and properties of the ﬁlms are greatly affected by doping levels. These ﬁlms are useful as conducting layers in electrochromic and photovoltaic devices.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a new gate-recessed AlGaN/GaN-based high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) on SiC substrate is proposed and its DC as well as microwave characteristics are discussed for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers using technology computer aided design (TCAD). THe two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) transport properties are discussed by solving Schödinger and Poison equations self-consistently resulting in various subbands having electron eigenvalues. From DC characteristics, the saturation drain currents are measured to be 600 mA/mm and  550 mA/mm for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively. Apart from DC, small-signal AC analysis has been done using two-port network for various microwwave parameters. The extrinsic transconductance parameters are measured to be 131.7 mS/mm at a gate voltage of $V_{gs} = -0.35$ V and 114.6 mS/mm at a gate voltage of $V_{gs} = -0.4$ V for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively. The current gain cut-off frequencies $(f_{t})$ are measured t be 27.1 GHz and 23.97 GHz in unit-gain-point method at a gate voltage of -0.4 V for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively. Similarly, the power gain cut-off frequencied $(f_{max})$ are measured to be 41 GHz and 38.5 GHz in unit-gain-point method at a gate voltage of -0.1 V for Si$_{3}$N$$_{4} and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively. Furthermore, the maximum frequency of oscillation or unit power gain (MUG = 1) cut-off frequencies for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers are measured to be 32 GHz and 28 GHz respectively from MUG curves and the unit current gain, $|h_{21}| = 1$ cut-off frequencies are measured to be 140 GHz and 75 GHz for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively from the $abs |h_{21}|$ curves. HEMT with Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ passivation layer giver better results than HEMT with SiO$_{2}$ passivation layer.</p>

					<p>A communication system involves the transmission of information from source to destination and after receiving all the information all the information or a complete signal an acknowledgement is then sent to the source by the destination itself to let the source know that is (destination) has received the signal. In this paper we examine about how to reduce the time of acknowledgement to make the communication faster. In this paper we present a method of sending an acknowledgement signal, in which the last quantum (sample) of the signal is used to compute the time of acknowledgement. The formula for calculating the time of acknowledgement in the case of a continuous time signal and a discrete time signal is also derived in the paper. This technique is applicable for analog communication, digital communication and space communication.</p>

				<page>0199-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For the standard quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model, we point out the occurrence of simultaneous (parallel), mutually irreducible and autonomous decoherence processes. Besides the standard Brownian particle, we show that there is at least another system undergoing the dynamics described by the QBM model. We do this by selecting the two mutually irreducible, global structures (decompositions into subsystems) of the composite system of the QBM model. The generalization of this observation is a new, challenging task in the foundations of the decoherence theory. We do not place our findings in any interpretational context.</p>

				<page>0211-0222</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A class of general relativistic solutions in isotropic spherical polar coordinates which describe compact stars in hydrostatic equilibrium are discussed. The stellar models obtained here are characterized by four parameters, namely, $\lambda$, $k$, $A$ and $R$ of geometrical significance related to the inhomogeneity of the matter content of the star. The stellar models obtained using the solutions are physically viable for a wide range of values of the parameters. The physical features of the compact objects taken up here are studied numerically for a number of admissible values of the parameters. Observational stellar mass data are used to construct suitable models of the compact stars.</p>

				<title>Quantum Jarzynski equality with multiple measurement and feedback for isolated system</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0233-0241</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we derive the Jarzynski equality (JE) for an isolated quantum system in three different cases: (i) the full evolution is unitary with no intermediate measurements, (ii) with intermediate measurements of arbitrary observables being performed, and (iii) with intermediate measurements whose outcomes are used to modify the external protocol (feedback). We assume that the measurements will involve errors that are purely classical in nature. Our treatment is based on path probability in state space for each realization. This is in contrast with the formal approach based on projection operator and density matrices. We find that the JE remains unaffected in the second case, but gets modified in the third case where the mutual information between the measured values with the actual eigenvalues must be incorporated into the relation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Production cross-sections of the therapeutic ${}^{105}$Rh radionuclide from proton-induced reactions on natural palladium target were measured using stacked-foil activation technique combined with high resolution $\gamma$-ray spectrometry at the MC50 cyclotron of the Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences. Note that cyclotron production of the $^105$Rh radionuclide from natural palladium target was measured here for the first time. Results are compared with the theoretical values obtained using the model codes TALYS and ALICE-IPPE. Thick target integral yields for the investigated $^105$Rh radionuclide were deduced from the threshold energy to 40 MeV. Measured data of the $^105$Rh radionuclide are important because of its potential applications in nuclear medicine and/or therapeutic purposes. Optimal production circumstances for the therapeutic $^105$Rh radionuclide using a cyclotron are discussed elaborately.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ${}^{232}$Th$(n, \gamma)$ reaction cross-section at average neutron energies of 13.5, 15.5 and 17.28 MeV from the $^7$Li$(p, n)$ reaction has been determined for the first time using activation and off-line $\gamma$-ray spectrometric technique. The $^232$Th$(n, 2n)$ cross-section at 17.28 MeV neutron energy has also been determined using the same technique. The experimentally determined $^232$Th$(n, \gamma)$ and $^232$Th$(n, 2n)$ reaction cross-sections from the present work were compared with the evaluated data of ENDF/BVII and JENDL-4.0 and were found to be in good agreement. The present data, along with literature data in a wide range of neutron energies, were interpreted in terms of competition between ${}^{232}$Th$(n, \gamma)$, $(n, f)$, $(n, nf)$ and $(n, xn)$ reaction channels. The ${}^{232}$Th$(n, \gamma)$ and ${}^{232}$Th$(n, 2n)$ reaction cross-sections were also calculated theoretically using the TALYS 1.2 computer code and were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data from the present work but were slightly higher than the literature data at lower neutron energies.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0263-0274</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A conventional 10 MeV drift tube Linac is designed as a part of the $H^-$ front end accelerator system for the future Indian Spallation Neutron Source. The front end Linac consists of a 50 keV H$^-$ ion source, low energy beam transport (LEBT), a 3 MeV radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ), and a 10 MeV drift tube Linac (DTL), which will be operated at 1.25$\%$ duty factor. Cell geometry of the DTL is optimized to house quadrupole magnets and to get maximum effective shunt impedance. Transmission efficiency and various other output parameters depend on the input design parameters. Beam dynamic studies are done to maximize the transmission efficiency with minimum emittance growth. Errors in the alignment of the quadrupoles inside the drift tubes or the DTL tank alignment with respect to transport line will degrade the beam quality and may reduce the transmission efficiency. Error study is performed to assess the acceptable tolerances on various parameters. This paper describes the 2D and 3D electromagnetic and beam dynamics simulations of the 352.2 MHz, 10 MeV drift tube Linac. Details of the DTL design are reported in this paper.</p>

					<p>This report gives a discussion of a new wave characteristic as a material parameter for a composite with the magnetoelectric effect. The new parameter depends on the material constants of a piezoelectromagnetic composite. It can be implemented on : (A) mechanically free, electrically and magnetically open surface and (B) mechanically free, electrically and magnetically closed surface. These theoretical investigations are useful for researches in the firlds of acousto-optics, photonics and opto-acousto-electronics. Some sample calculations are carried out for BaTiO$_3$ - CoFe$_2$O$_4$ and PZT-5H-Terfenol-D composites of class $6 mm$. Also, the first and second derivatives of the new parameter with respect to the electromagnetic constant $\alpha$ are graphically shown.</p>

				<page>0287-0297</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A time-dependent analytical thermal model of the temperature and the corresponding induced thermal stresses in continuous wave double-end-pumped laser rod are derived from the ﬁrst principle using the integral transform method. The aim of the paper is to study the effect of increasing the pumping powers while the laser crystals are still in the safe zone (i.e. far away from failure stress) and to suitably choose a crystal that achieves this task. The result of this work is compared with a well-veriﬁed ﬁnite element solution and a good agreement has been found. Some conclusions are obtained: Tm:YAP crystal, which has high thermal conductivity, low expansion coefﬁcient, low absorption coefﬁcient, low thermal factor and low product of $\gamma E/(1−\nu)$, is the best choice to reduce induced stress although it is responded and brought to thermal equilibrium faster than the other types of crystal usually used in the end-pumped solid-state laser.</p>

				<title>Calibration-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy for quantitative elemental analysis of materials</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0299-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The application of calibration-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (CF-LIBS) for quantitative analysis of materials, illustrated by CF-LIBS applied to a brass sample of known composition, is presented in this paper. The LIBS plasma is produced by a 355 nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a pulse duration of 6 ns focussed onto a brass sample in air at atmospheric pressure. The time-resolved atomic and ionic emission lines of Cu and Zn from the LIBS spectra recorded by an Echelle spectrograph coupled with a gated intensified charge coupled detector are used for the plasma characterization and the quantitative analysis of the sample. The time delay where the plasma is optically thin and is also in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), necessary for the elemental analysis of samples from the LIBS spectra, is deduced. An algorithm relating the experimentally measured spectral intensity values with the basic physics of the plasma is developed. Using the algorithm, the Zn and Cu concentratioins in the brass sample are determined. The analytical result obtained from the CF-LIBS technique agree well with the certified valued of the elements in the sample, with an accuracy error $&#60; 1 \%$</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0311-0318</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By generalizing the complex potential approach developed by Lekhnitskii, plane problems of one-dimensional quasicrystals are solved first by using an octet formalism for which there are four pairs of comple roots; The approach uses a representation of stresses and proceeds by integration of the expressions for deformations and application of the anisotropic constitutive law and the compatibility of displacements. To illustrate its utility, the generalized lekhnitskii's formalism is used to analyse the coupled phonon and phason fields in an infinite quasicrystal medium containing an elliptic rigid inclusion.</p>

					<p>We have analytically explored the temperature dependence of critical number of particales for the collapse of a harmonically trapped attractively interacting Bose gas below the condensation point by introducing a kinetic approach within the Hartee-Fock approximation.

				<abstract>
					<p>The qubit (or a system of two quantum dots) has become a standard paradigm for studying quantum information processes. Our focus is decoherence due to interaction of the qubit with its environment, leading to noise. We consider quantum noise generated by a dissipative quantum bath. A detailed comparative study with the results for a classical noise source such as generated by a telegraph process, enebles us to set limits on the pplicability of this process $\nu is à \nu is$ its quantum counterpart, as well as lend handle on the parameters that can be tuned for analysing decoherence. Both Ohmic and non-Ohmic dissipations are treated and appropriate limits are analysed for facilitating comparison with the telegraph process.</p>

					<p>Coupled discrete models are ubiquitous in a variety of physical contexts. We provide an extensive set of exact quasiperiodic solutions of a number of coupled discrete models in terms of Lamé polynomials of arbitrary order. The models discussed are: (i) coupled Salerno model, (ii) coupled Ablowitz–Ladik model, (iii) coupled $\phi^4$ model and (iv) coupled $\phi^6$ model. In all these cases we show that the coefﬁcients of the Lamé polynomials are such that the Lamé polynomials can be re-expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of the relevant Jacobi elliptic function.</p>

					<p>High-spin states of ${}^{216}$Ra $(Z = 88,N = 128)$ have been investigated through ${}^{209}$Bi(${}^{10}$B, 3n) reaction at an incident beam energy of 55 MeV and ${}^{209}$Bi(${}^{11}$B, 4n) reaction at incident beam energies ranging from 65 to 78 MeV. Based on $\gamma \gamma$ coincidence data, the level scheme for ${}^{216}$Ra has been considerably extended up to $\sim 33\hbar$ spin and 7.2 MeV excitation energy in the present experiment with placement of 28 new $\gamma$-transitions over what has been reported earlier. Tentative spin-parity assignments are done for the newly proposed levels on the basis of the DCO ratios corresponding to strong gates. Empirical shell model calculations were carried out to provide an understanding of the underlying nuclear structure.</p>

					<p>In the present work, the isospin admixtures in the nuclear ground states of the parent nuclei and isospin structure of the isobar analog resonance (IAR) states have been investigated by studying the $0^{+} \rightarrow 0^{+}$ superallowed Fermi $\beta$ decays using Pyatov’s restoration method.

				<abstract>
					<p>The factors influencing the trajectory of long-range $\alpha$-particle in the cold ternary fission of ${}^{252}$Cf are discussed. The trajectory of the $\alpha$-particle is studied by considering the influence of the force on the $\alpha$-particle due to Coulomb and proximity potentials and is found to have sensitive dependence on the initial position and initial energy of the $\alpha$-particle. The sensitivity to initial conditions signifies the presence of deterministic chaos which is characterized by Lyapunov exponent (LE). The LE is calculated using Wolf’s algorithm and found positive which implies that the objectives of trajectory calculations are restricted.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Considering interactions and scattering of positrons with argon (Ar) and krypton (Kr) atoms, we have calculated total cross-sections $(Q_{T} = Q_{el} + Q_{inel})$ using complex spherical potentials for these systems. In positron–atom scattering it is difficult to bifurcate the ionization and cumulative excitation contained in the total inelastic cross-section. An approximate method called CSP-ic (complex scattering potential-ionization contribution) similar to electron–atom scattering has been applied to bifurcate ionization and cumulative excitation cross-sections at energies from the threshold to 2000 eV. Adequate comparisons of the present results are made, with available data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The electric field enhancement inside a nanotube irradiated by intense ultrashort laser pulse ($\ll 1$ ps) is calculated. The hollowness of the nanotubes determines the field enhancement and the electron density at which such structures exhibit resonance. The electric field in a nanotube plasma is shown to be resonantly enhanced at multiple densities during the two phases of interaction: the ionization phase and the hydrodynamic expansion phase. It is further shown that by a proper choice of hollowness of the nanotubes, a continued occurrence of the resonance over a longer time can be achieved. These properties make nanotubes efficient absorbers of intense ultrashort laser pulses.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0457-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Swelling kinetics of water-swollen polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels (WSG) was investigated in various concentrations of aqueous NaCl by macroscopic swelling measurements. For lower concentration of NaCl, WSG showed exponential swelling whereas at higher concentration of NaCl it underwent deswelling at short times and exponential swelling at long times. From these studies, collective diffusion coefficient, $D$, of the polymer network and polymer–solvent interaction parameter, $\chi$ , were calculated and found to decrease with increase in [NaCl]. Collective diffusion coefficients measured from dynamic light scattering (DLS) and that obtained from macroscopic swelling measurements are found to agree well. Measured ensemble-averaged dynamic structure factor $f (q, t)$ for WSG and salt-swollen gels (SSG) showed an initial decay followed by a plateau at long times and it can be described by harmonically bound Brownian particle (HBBP) model. Enhanced scattering intensity at low scattering angles using static light scattering (SLS) measurements revealed the presence of inhomogeneities in PAAm gels. The reasons for increased scattering intensity of SSG over WSG gel and the linear decrease of $D$ with increase in NaCl concentration are explained.</p>

				<page>0471-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the relaxation dynamics of photogenerated carriers in silicon nanowires consisting of a crystalline core and a surrounding amorphous shell, using femtosecond time resolved differential reflectivity and transmission spectroscopy at 3.15 eV and 1.57 eV photon energies. The complex behaviour of the differential transmission and reflectivity transients is the mixed contributions from the crystalline core and the amorphous silicon on the nanowire surface and the substrate where competing effects of state-filling and photoinduced absorption govern the carrier dynamics. Faster relaxation rates are observed on increasing the photogenerated carrier density. Independent experimental results on crystalline silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) help us in separating the contributions from the carrier dynamics in crystalline core and the amorphous regions in the nanowire samples. Further, single-beam z-scan nonlinear transmission experiments at 1.57 eV in both open- and close-aperture configurations yield two-photon absorption coefficient $\beta$ ($\sim$3 cm/GW) and nonlinear refraction coefficient $\gamma$ ($−2.5 × 10^{−4}$ cm$^2$ /GW).</p>

				<page>0483-0491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we study the Indian highway network as a complex network where the junction points are considered as nodes, and the links are formed by an existing connection. We explore the topological properties and community structure of the network. We observe that the Indian highway network displays small-world properties and is assortative in nature. We also identify the most important road-junctions (or cities) in the highway network based on the betweenness centrality of the node. This could help in identifying the potential congestion points in the network. Our study is of practical importance and could provide a novel approach to reduce congestion and improve the performance of the highway network.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0493-0499</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Random geographical networks are realistic models for wireless sensor networks which are used in many applications. Achieving average consensus is very important in sensor networks and the faster the consensus is, the durable the sensors’ life, and thus, the better the performance of the network. In this paper we compared the performance of a number of linear consensus algorithms with application to distributed averaging in random geographical networks. Interestingly, the simplest algorithm – where only the degree of receiving nodes is needed for the averaging – had the best performance in terms of the consensus time. Furthermore, we proved that the network has guaranteed convergence with this simple algorithm.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We examine the role of space-time geometry in the non-adiabatic collapse of a star dissipating energy in the form of radial heat flow, studying its evolution under different initial conditions. The collapse of a star filled with a homogeneous perfect fluid is compared with that of a star filled with inhomogeneous imperfect fluid under anisotropic pressure. Both the configurations are spherically symmetric. However, in the latter case, the physical space $t$ = constant of the configurations endowed with spheroidal or pseudospheroidal geometry is assumed to be inhomogeneous. It is observed that as long as the collapse is shear-free, its evolution depends only on the mass and size of the star at the onset of collapse.</p>

				<page>0513-0539</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The theoretical aspects of the physics of Higgs bosons are reviewed focussing on the elements that are relevant for the production and detection at present hadron colliders. After briefly summarizing the basics of electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model, the Higgs production at the LHC and at the Tevatron is discussed, with some focus on the main production mechanism, the gluon–gluon fusion process, and the main Higgs decay modes and the experimental detection channels are discussed. Then the case of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model is briefly surveyed. In the last section, the prospects for determining the fundamental properties of the Higgs particles are reviewed, once they have been experimentally observed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The investigation of the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking is one of the most important tasks of the scientific program of the Large Hadron Collider. The experimental results on the search of the Standard Model Higgs boson with 1 to 2 fb$^−1$ of proton–proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector are presented and discussed. No significant excess of events is found with respect to the expectations from Standard Model processes, and the production of a Higgs boson is excluded at $95\%$ Confidence Level for the mass regions 144–232, 256–282 and 296–466 GeV.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Since the top quark was discovered at Tevatron in 1995, many top quark properties have been measured. However, the top quark is still interesting due to unique features which originate from the extremely heavy mass, and providing various test grounds on the Standard Model as well as searches for a new physics. Though the measurements of the top quark had been performed only at Tevatron so far, LHC is now ready for measurements with more top quarks than Tevatron. In this article, recent measurements of top quark properties from Tevatron (CDF and DØ) as well as LHC (ATLAS and CMS) are presented.</p>

					<p>In this paper, two key issues related to electroweak symmetry breaking are addressed. First, how ﬁne-tuned different models are that trigger this phenomenon? Second, even if a light Higgs boson exists, does it have to be necessarily elementary? After a brief introduction, the ﬁne-tuning aspects of the MSSM, NMSSM, generalized NMSSM and GMSB scenarios shall be reviewed, then the little Higgs, composite Higgs and the Higgsless models shall be compared. Finally, a broad overview will be given on where we stand at the end of 2011.</p>

				<title>Heavy ions: Results from the Large Hadron Collider</title>
				<feature>Heavy-Ion Physics</feature>
				<page>0719-0735</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>On November 8, 2010 the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN collided the ﬁrst stable beams of heavy ions (Pb on Pb) at the centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV/nucleon. The LHC worked exceedingly well during its one month of operation with heavy ions, delivering about 10 $\mu$b$^{−1}$ of data, with peak luminosity reaching to $L_{O} = 2 × 10^{25}$ cm$^{−2}$ s$^{−1}$ towards the end of the run. Three experiments, ALICE, ATLAS and CMS, recorded their ﬁrst heavy-ion data, which were analysed in a record time. The results of the multiplicity, ﬂow, ﬂuctuations and Bose–Einstein correlations indicate that the ﬁreball formed in nuclear collisions at the LHC is hotter, lives longer, and expands to a larger size at freeze-out as compared to lower energies. We give an overview of these as well as new results on quarkonia and heavy ﬂavour suppression, and jet energy loss.</p>

A wealth of new results appeared recently from RHIC due to major recent upgrades, like for example the $\Upsilon$ suppression in central nucleus-nucleus collisions which has been discovered recently in both RHIC and LHC. Furthermore, we discuss RHIC results from the beam energy scan (BES) program aiming to search for a possible critical point and to map out the QCD phase diagram.</p>

				<page>0757-0780</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Low-energy solar neutrino detection plays a fundamental role in understanding both solar astrophysics and particle physics. After introducing the open questions on both ﬁelds, we review here the major results of the last two years and expectations for the near future from Borexino, Super-Kamiokande, SNO and KamLAND experiments as well as from upcoming (SNO$+$) and planned (LENA) experiments. Scintillator neutrino detectors are also powerful antineutrino detectors which can detect neutrinos emitted by the Earth crust and mantle. First measurements of geoneutrinos have occurred which can bring fundamental contribution in understanding the geophysics of the planet.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We consider lepton ﬂavour violation (LFV) in the charged lepton sector both from the bottom-up effective Lagrangian approach and from the top-down approach via various case studies that have been analysed. The implications for LFV studies at the LHC is brieﬂy discussed. Finally the nature of LFV in the neutrino sector is considered, paying particular regard to the implications of the recent measurements of $\theta_{13}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The $t\bar{t} + 1-{\text{jet}} + X$ differential cross-section in proton-proton collissions at 7 TeV centre of mass energy is investigated with respect to its sensitivity to the top quark mass. The analysis includes higher order QCD corrections at NLO. The impact of the renormalization scale $(\mu_{\text{R}})$, the factorization $(\mu_{\text{F}})$ scale and of the choice of different proton's PDF (parton distribution function) has been evaluated. In this study it is concluded that differential jet rates offer a promising option for alternative mass measurements of the top quark, with theoretical uncertainties below 1 GeV.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The compact muon solenoid (CMS) is one of the four experiments which is getting and analysing the results of the collision of protons at LHC. The CMS trigger system is divided into two stages, the level-1 trigger and high-level triggers, to handle the large stream of data produced in collision. The information transmitted from the three muon subsystems (DT, CSC and RPC) are collected by the Global Muon Trigger (GMT) Board and merged. A method for evaluating the RPC system trigger efﬁciency with data from $pp$ collision was developed using the features of GMT. The results of the study with the real data of 2011 are shown and discussed here along with the comparison of Monte Carlo results</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A search for the Standard Model boson decaying to two $Z$ bosons with a subsequent decay to a final state with two leptons and two quark jets, $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow l^{+}l^{-} q\bar{q}$, is presented. Data corresponding to an ntegrated luminosity of 1.6 fb$^{-1}$ of LHC proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV were collected and analysed by the CMS experiment. The selection to discriminate between signal and background events is based on kinematic and topological quantities, which include the angular spin correlations of the decay products. The events are classified according to the probability of the jets to originate from quarks of light or heavy flavour or from gluons. No evidence for a Higgs boson is found and upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross-section are set in the range of masses between 226 and 600 GeV/c$^2$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present the measurements of the differential cross-sections for inclusive electron and muon production in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, using $\sim$ 1.4 pb$^{−1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The muon cross-section is measured as a function of muon transverse momentum $p_{\text{T}}$ in the range $4 &#60; p_{\text{T}} &#60; 100$ GeV and within pseudorapidity $|\eta| &#60; 2.5$. In addition, the electron and muon cross-sections are measured in the range $7 &#60; p_{\text{T}} &#60; 26$ GeV and within $|\eta| &#60; 2.0$, excluding $1.37 &#60; |\eta| &#60; 1.52$. After subtraction of the$ W/Z/\gamma^{*}$ contribution, the differential cross-sections are found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions for heavy-ﬂavour production obtained from ﬁxed order NLO calculations with NLL high-$p_{\text{T}}$ resummation, and to be sensitive to the effects of NLL resummation.</p>

				<page>0829-0832</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Results are presented on a search for charged massive long-lived particles (CMLLPs), based on 5.2 fb$^{−1}$ of integrated luminosity collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar{p}$ collider. This search selects events in which one or more particles are reconstructed as muons but their speed and ionization energy loss (d$E$/d$x$) are different from muons produced in beam–beam collisions. CMLLPs have been predicted by several theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. In this search we exclude pair-produced long-lived gaugino-like charginos with masses below 251 GeV and higgsino-like charginos with masses below 230 GeV at $95\%$ CL, as well as long-lived stop quarks with masses below 265 GeV. We place cross-section limits on long-lived staus as 0.04 to 0.006 pb for stau masses in the range 100 to 300 GeV.</p>

				<title>Flavoured co-annihilation</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0849-0852</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) or CMSSM, one of the main co-annihilating partners of the neutralino is the lightest stau, $\tilde{\tau}_{1}$. In the presence of flavour violation in the right-handed sector, the co-annihilating partner would be a flavour mixed state. The flavour effect is two-fold: (a) It changes the mass of $\tlide{\tau}_{1}$, thus modifying the parameter space of the co-annihilation and (b) flavour violating scatterings could now contibute to the cross-sections in the early Universe. In fact, it is shown that for large enough $\delta \sim 0.2$, these processes would constitute the dominant channels in co-annihilation regions. The amount of flavour mixing permissible is constrained by flavour violating $\tau \rightarrow \mu$ or $\tau \rightarrow e$ processes. For $\Delta_{\text{RR}}$ mass insertions, the constraints from flavour violation are not strong enough in some regions of the parameter space dur to partial cancellations in the amplitudes. In mSUGRA, the regions with cancelations within LFV amplitudes do not overlap with the regions of co-annihilations. In non-universal HIggs model (NUHM), however, these regions do overlap leading to significant flavoured co-annihilations. At the LHC and other colliders, these regions can constitute for interesting signals.</p>

				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0863-0866</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study of formation of heavy quarkonia in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides important insight into the properties of the produced high-density QCD medium. Lattice QCD studies show sequential suppression of quarkonia states with increasing temperature; which affirms that a full spectroscopy can provide us a thermometer for the matter produced under extreme conditions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and one of the most direct probes of deconfinement. Muons from the decay of charmonium resonances are detected in ALICE experiment in $p + p$ and Pb $+$ Pb collisions with a muon spectrometer, covering the forward rapidity region $(2.5 &#60; y &#60; 4)$. The analysis of the inclusive $J/\psi$ production in the first Pb $+$ Pb data collected in the fall of 2010 at a centre of mass energy of $\sqrt{^{s}NN} = 2.76$ TeV is discussed. Preliminary results on the nuclear modification factor $(R_{AA})$ and the central to peripheral nuclear modification factor $(R_{CP})$ are presented.</p>

				<title>A natural connection between neutrino mass generation and the lightness of a next-to-minimal supersymmetric Standard Model pseudoscalar</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0867-0870</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the attractive properties of the NMSSM is that it can accommodate a light pseudoscalar of order 10 GeV. However, such scenarios are constrained by several experimental results, especially those related to the fermionic decays of the pseudoscalar. In this work, extending the NMSSM field content by two gauge singlets, with lepton number $+1$ and $−1$, we generate neutrino masses via the inverse see-saw mechanism at one hand and on the other hand a very light pseudoscalar becomes experimentally viable by having dominant invisible decay channels which help it to evade the existing bounds.</p>

				<title>Search for heavy resonances decaying to tau pairs with the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0871-0874</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A search for heavy resonance production decaying to tau pair is performed in the proton–proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV using 36 pb$^−1$ of data collected with CMS detector at the LHC during the year 2010. The number of observed events are in good agreement with the predictions of Standard Model background processes. Therefore, an upper limit on the resonance cross-section times the branching ratio to tau pair is obtained as a function of the resonance mass. Ditau resonance Z' with Standard Model couplings having mass less than 468 GeV/c$^2$ is excluded at $95\%$ confidence level.</p>

				<title>Ultraheavy Yukawa-bound states of fourth-generation at Large Hadron Collider</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0879-0882</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A study of bound states of the fourth-generation quarks in the range of 500–700 GeV is presented, where the binding energies are expected to be mainly of Yukawa origin, with QCD subdominant. Near degeneracy of their masses exhibits a new `isospin'. The production of a colour- octet, isosinglet vector meson via $q\bar{q} \rightarrow \omega g$ is the most interesting. Its leading decay modes are $\pi_{8}^{\pm} W^{\mp}, \pi_{8}^{0} Z^{0}$ , and constituent quark decay, with $q\bar{q}$ and $t\bar{t'}$ and $b\bar{b'}̄ subdominant. The colour octet, isovector pseudoscalar $\pi_{8}$ meson decays via constituent quark decay, or to $W g$. This work calls for more detailed study of fourth-generation phenomena at LHC.</p>

				<title>Physics beyond the Standard Model through $b \rightarrow s\mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ transition</title>

				<page>0895-0898</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive study of the impact of new-physics operators with different Lorentz structures on decays involving the $b \rightarrow s\mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ transition is performed. The effects of new vector– axial vector (VA), scalar–pseudoscalar (SP) and tensor (T) interactions on the differential branching ratios, forward–backward asymmetries ($A_{\text{FB}}$ ’s), and direct CP asymmetries of $\bar{B}_{s}^{0} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, \bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow X_{s} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, \bar{B}_{s}^{0} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-} \gamma, \bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow \bar{K} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$, and $\bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow \bar{K}^{*} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ are examined. In $\bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow \bar{K}^{*} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$, we also explore the longitudinal polarization fraction $f_{\text{L}}$ and the angular asymmetries $A_{\text{T}}^{2}$ and $A_{\text{LT}}$, the direct CP asymmetries in them, as well as the triple-product CP asymmetries $A_{\text{T}}^{\text{(im)}}$ and $A_{\text{{LT}}^{\text{(im)}}$. While the new VA operators can significantly enhance most of the observables beyond the Standard Model predictions, the SP and T operators can do this only for $A_{\text{FB}}$ in $\bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow \bar{K} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$.</p>

				<title>Limits on anomalous trilinear gauge couplings at the CMS with 7TeV Large Hadron Collider data</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0899-0902</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Diboson production in proton–proton collisions presents an opportunity to study the self-interaction between gauge bosons via anomalous trilinear gauge couplings (aTGC). The values of these couplings are fully fixed in the SM by the gauge structure. Thus, any deviation of the observed strength of the TGC from the SM prediction would indicate new physics. This paper presents the limits on anomalous $WW\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma$ and $Z\gamma \gamma$ trilinear gauge couplings in proton–proton collisions at the centre of mass energy of 7 TeV with the CMS detector.</p>

					<p>Measurements of differential cross-sections of $W$ boson production in association with jets, and jets containing $b$ hadrons are presented. The measurements are based on 35 pb$^−1$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, using the electron and muon decay channels of the $W$ boson. The data are found to be compatible with next-to-leading order predictions. In addition, a study of the invariant mass distribution of jet pairs produced in association with a $W$ boson is presented, based on an integrated luminosity of 1.02 fb$^−1$. The measured dijet mass shows no significant excess over the Standard Model expectation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The production of $Z$ bosons in association with at least one $b$-jet and $Z$ decaying into muons or electrons is studied. This analysis is done by using proton–proton collisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV and with data recorded by the CMS detector in 2010, representing an integrated luminosity of 36 pb$^{−1}$. A final state of two wellidentified muons or electrons and at least one $b$-tagged jet are required in order to perform this study. The event yields and shapes of kinematic variables are compared with Monte Carlo predictions from MADGRAPH. The ratio $\sigma (Z + b)/\sigma (Z + j)$ is found to be $0.054 \pm 0.016 (0.046 \pm 0.014)$ in the data for the $Z \rightarrow ee (Z \rightarrow \mu\mu)$ selection, compared to $0.043 \pm 0.005 (0.047 \pm 0.005)$ estimated from NLO theory predictions.</p>

The five-dimensional $c$-parameters are fit to the charged lepton and neutrino masses and mixings using $\chi^{2}$ minimization. Leptonic flavour violation is shown to be large in these cases.

					<p>The measurement of the inclusive cross-section for $Z\gamma$ production at LHC with 7 TeV proton–proton collision is presented. The electron and muon decay modes are used to reconstruct the $Z$ boson. The total cross-section is measured for photon transverse energy greater than 10 GeV and with photon and charged lepton separation in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal angle plane greater than 0.7. This study is extended by a measurement of $Z(\nu \bar{\nu})\gamma$ cross-section. A search is performed for extra dimensions in the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, Dvali framework using the final state of a graviton and photon. The limits are extended with MD $> 1.25–1.31$ TeV for $n = 2-6$. The measurement is found to be in agreement with the Standard Model prediction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A search for excited leptons, carried out with the CMS detector in $pp$ collision at the LHC with $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, is presented. The search has been performed for an associated production of a lepton and an oppositely charged excited lepton $pp \rightarrow ll^{*}$, followed by the decay $l^{*} \rightarrow l\gamma$ , resulting in $ll\gamma$ final state, where $l = e,\mu$. No excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed in the data. Interpreting the findings in the context of $l^{∗}$ production through four-fermion contact interactions and $l^{∗}$ decay via electroweak processes, upper limits are reported for $l^{∗}$ production at this collision energy and the exclusion region in the $\Lambda - M(l^{*})$ parameter space is extended beyond the previously established limits.</p>

				<title>Search for the Higgs boson in the $H \rightarrow WW \rightarrow \ell \nu jj$ decay channel in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0933-0936</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A search for a Higgs boson has been performed in the $H \rightarrow WW \rightarrow \ell \nu jj$ channel using 1.04 fb$^{−1}$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess of events is observed over the expected Standard Model (SM) background and limits on the Higgs boson production cross-section are derived for a Higgs boson mass in the range 240 GeV $&#60; m_{\text{H}} &#60; 600$ GeV. The best sensitivity is obtained for $m_{\text{H}} = 400$ GeV, where the $95\%$ confidence level upper bound on the cross-section for $H \rightarrow WW$ production is 3.1 pb, or 2.7 times the Standard Model prediction.</p>

				<title>Measurement of the Drell–Yan differential cross-section $d\sigma/dM$ at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0937-0940</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Drell–Yan differential cross-section is measured in proton–proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, from a data sample collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $36 \pm 1.4$ pb$^{−1}$. The measured cross-section is normalized to the cross-section of the $Z$-peak region, for both dimuon and dielectron final state, in the dilepton invariant mass range of 15–600 GeV/c$^{2}$. The normalized cross-section values are quoted in the full phase-space and within the detector acceptance. The effect of final-state radiation is also studied and the measurements are correted for this. The measurements are compared to the theoretical predictions and are found to be in good agreement.</p>

				<feature>Neutrino Physics II</feature>
				<page>0941-0952</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) experiment studies neutrino oscillations in a $\sim 600$ MeV muon neutrino beam sent at 295 km from the Japan Proton Accelerator Complex (J-PARC) to the Super Kamiokande (SK) detector in Kamioka. The primary goals of T2K are to search for the appearance of electron neutrinos at SK resulting from $\theta_{13} > 0$ and to precisely measure $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m_{32}^{2}$ via $\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance. We report on T2K results obtained from neutrino data taken in 2010 and 2011.</p>

				<page>0953-0962</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The new results available this year from a number of neutrino experiments bring into stronger focus the details in the `Standard Model' of neutrino oscillations described by the PMNS mixing matrix. However, the parameters are still not known to very high precision. The next few years look bright for accelerator neutrino experiments, with much action occurring in the near future. We still have to wait a little longer, however, to be sure, but making educated guesses is needed to make plans for the future.</p>

				<title>Neutrino mass and mixing – status</title>
				<feature>Neutrino Physics II</feature>
				<page>0979-0992</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The status of neutrino oscillations from global data are summarized. An update on the three-flavour picture and recent developments are discussed with regard to the measurement of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$. Global data currently provide an indication at $3\sigma$ that $\theta_{13}$ is non-zero. Furthermore, the status of sterile neutrino oscillation interpretations of the LSND anomaly in the light of MiniBooNE results and a recent re-evaluation of the neutrino fluxes from nuclear reactors are discussed. Despite several hints for sterile neutrinos at the eV scale, there is severe tension in the global data and no consistent description of all data is possible.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents options for high-energy colliders at the energy frontier for the years to come. The immediate plans include the exploitation of the LHC at its design luminosity and energy as well as upgrades to the LHC (luminosity and energy) and to its injectors. This may be complemented by a linear electron–positron collider, based on the technology being developed by the Compact Linear Collider and by the International Linear Collider, by a high-energy electron– proton machine, the LHeC, and/or by a muon collider. This contribution describes the various future directions, all of which have a unique value to add to experimental particle physics, and concludes by outlining the key messages for the way forward.</p>

					<p>The current status of the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is summarized. The main physics goals are described followed by the motivation for building a magnetized iron calorimetric (ICAL) detector. The charge identification capability of ICAL would make it complementary to large water Cerenkov and other detectors worldwide. The status of the design of the 50 kt magnet, the construction of a prototype ICAL detector, the experience with resistive plate chambers which will be the active elements in ICAL and the status of the associated electronics and data acquisition system are discussed.</p>

				<title>Review of dark matter direct detection experiments</title>
				<feature>Dark matter</feature>
				<page>1045-1057</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Matter, as we know it, makes up less than $5\%$ of the Universe. Various astrophysical observations have confirmed that one quarter of the Universe and most of the matter content in the Universe is made up of dark matter. The nature of dark matter is yet to be discovered and is one of the biggest questions in physics. Particle physics combined with astrophysical measurements of the abundance gives rise to a dark matter candidate called weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). The low density of WIMPs in the galaxies and the extremely weak nature of the interaction with ordinary matter make detection of the WIMP an extraordinarily challenging task, with abundant fakes from various radioactive and cosmogenic backgrounds with much stronger electromagnetic interaction. The extremely weak nature of the WIMP interaction dictates detectors that have extremely low naturally occurring radioactive background, a large active volume (mass) of sensitive detector material to maximize statistics, a highly efficient detector-based rejection mechanism for the dominant electromagnetic background and sophisticated analysis techniques to reject any residual background. This paper reviews currently available major technologies being pursued by various collaborations, with special emphasis on the cryogenic Ge detector technology used by the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search Collaboration (CDMS).</p>

				<title>The information paradox: Conflicts and resolutions</title>
				<feature>Gravity, Comology and Dark Energy</feature>
				<page>1059-1073</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many relativists have been long convinced that black hole evaporation leads to information loss or remnants. String theorists have however not been too worried about the issue, largely due to a belief that the Hawking argument for information loss is flawed in its details. A recently derived inequality shows that the Hawking argument for black holes with horizon can in fact be made rigorous. What happens instead is that in string theory, black hole microstates have no horizons. Thus the evolution of radiation quanta with $E \sim kT$ is modified by order unity at the horizon, and we resolve the information paradox.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The large mass of the top quark, close to the electroweak symmetry-breaking scale, makes it a good candidate for probing physics beyond the Standard Model, including possible anomalous couplings. D0 has made measurements of single top quark production using 5.4 fb$^−1$ of integrated luminosity. The data are examined to study the Lorentz structure of the $W tb$ coupling. It is found that the data prefer the left-handed vector coupling and set upper limits on the anomalous couplings.</p>

					<p>The measurement of $t$-channel single top cross-section in proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, using data collected with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment during the year 2010 is presented. Both the electronneutrino and muon-neutrino decay channels of $W$ boson from top decay are considered. Two complementary multivariate analysis methods to separate signal and background and to extract the cross-section for the single top produced in $t$-channel are explored.

				<abstract>
					<p>CMS has developed sophisticated tau identification algorithms for tau hadronic decay modes. Production of tau lepton decaying to hadrons are studied at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy with 2011 collision data collected by CMS detector and has been used to measure the performance of tau identification algorithms by measuring identification efficiency and misidentification rates from electrons, muons and hadronic jets. These algorithms enable extended reach for the searches for MSSM Higgs, $Z$ and other exotic particles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is recording data from proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV since the spring of 2010. The integrated luminosity has grown nearly exponentially since then and continues to rise fast. The ATLAS Collaboration has set up a framework to automatically process the rapidly growing dataset and produce performance and physics plots for the most interesting analyses. The system is designed to give fast feedback. The histograms are produced within hours of data reconstruction (2–3 days after data taking). Hints of potentially interesting physics signals obtained this way are followed up by physics groups.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The main injector particle production (MIPP) experiment at Fermilab uses particle beams of charged pions, kaons, proton and antiproton with beam momenta of 5–90 GeV/c to measure particle production cross-sections of various nuclei including liquid hydrogen, MINOS target and thin targets of beryllium, carbon, bismuth and uranium. The physics motivation to perform such cross-section measurements is described here. Recent results on the analysis of NuMI target and forward neutron cross-sections are presented here. Preliminary cross-section measurements for 58 GeV/c proton on liquid hydrogen target are also presented. A new method is described to correct for low multiplicity inefficiencies in the trigger using KNO scaling.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of an anomalous $\gamma W W$ coupling in the $e^{-} \gamma \rightarrow \nu_{e} W^{-}$ process through the angular and energy spectrum of the secondary leptons is investigated. Within the narrowwidth-approximation (NWA), a semianalytical study of the secondary lepton energy angle double distribution is considered. Different observables constructed using this distribution are expected to be very effective to probe the anomalous coupling at a typical International Linear Collider machine. Further, suitable combinations of these observables could be used to disentangle the effect of contributions from different terms in the effective Lagrangian.</p>

				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>1251-1254</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>From inclusive measurements, it is known that about $7\%$ of all $B$ mesons decay into final states with baryons. In these decays, some striking features become visible compared to mesonic decays. The largest branching fractions come with quite moderate multiplicities of 3–4 hadrons. We note that two-body decays to baryons are suppressed relative to three- and four-body decays. In most of these analyses, the invariant baryon–antibaryon mass shows an enhancement near the threshold. We propose a phenomenological interpretation of this quite common feature of hadronization to baryons.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results of a model-independent analysis, which systematically scans the data taken by CMS for deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions. Due to the minimal theoretical bias, this approach is sensitive to a variety of models for new physics. Events with at least one electron or muon are classified according to their content of reconstructed objects (muons, electrons, photons, jets and missing transverse energy). A broad scan of three kinematic distributions in those classes is performed by identifying deviations from SM expectations, accounting for systematic uncertainties. In this particular search, no significant discrepancies have been observed in data taken by CMS in 2010 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 pb$^{−1}$.</p>

					<p>Finding the evidence of new physics beyond the Standard Model is one of the primary goals of RunII of the Tevatron. Many dedicated searches for new physics are ongoing at the Tevatron but in order to broaden the scope and maximize the chances of finding the new physics, we also search in a model-independent way.

In the absence of supersymmetry, we show how experimentally verifiable radiative see-saw formula of Ma type is realized in non-SUSY $SO(10)$ while fulfilling the twin objectives: precision gauge coupling unification and dark matter.

					<p>The top polarization at the International Linear Collider (ILC) with transverse beam polarization is utilized in the $e^{+} e^{-} \rightarrow t\bar{t}$ process to probe interactions of the scalar and tensor type beyond the Standard Model and to disentangle their individual contributions. Confidence level limits of $90\%$ are presented on the interactions with realistic integrated luminosity and are found to improve by an order of magnitude compared to the case when the spin of the top quark is not measured. Sensitivities of the order of a few times $10^{−3}$ TeV$^{−2}$ for real and imaginary parts of both scalar and tensor couplings at $\sqrt{s} = 500$ and 800 GeV with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{−1}$ and completely polarized beams are shown to be possible.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The new physics (NP) is parametrized with four model-independent quantities: the magnitudes and phases of the dispersive part $M_{12}$ and the absorptive part $\Gamma_{12}$ of the NP contribution to the effective Hamiltonian. We constrain these parameters using the four observables $\Delta M_{\text{s}}$, $\Delta \Gamma_{\text{s}}$, the mixing phase $\beta_{\text{s}}^{J/\psi \phi}$ and $A_{\text{sl}}^{b}$. This formalism is extended to include charge-parity-time reversal (CPT) violation, and it is shown that CPT violation by itself, or even in the presence of CPTconserving NP without an absorptive part, helps only marginally in the simultaneous resolution of these anomalies.</p>

					<p>The large forward–backward asymmetry in top pair-production observed at the Tevatron has generated much excitement in recent times.Many different models have been proposed as possible explanations for this anomaly. We discuss how the measurement of the polarization of the top quark can be used to establish the role of new physics in generating the observed asymmetry and to characterize and discriminate among various models.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The predictions for high-energy neutrino and antineutrino deep inelastic scattering cross-sections are compared within the conventional {\bf DGLAP} formalism of next-to-leading order {\bf QCD}, using the latest parton distribution functions ({\bf PDF}) such as {\bf CT10, HERAPDF1.5} and {\bf MSTW08} and taking account of {\bf PDF} uncertainties. From this, a benchmark cross-section and uncertainty are derived which is consistent with the results obtained earlier using the {\bf ZEUS-S PDFs}. The use of this is advocated for analysing data from neutrino telescopes, in order to facilitate comparison between their results.</p>

				<title>Triggering on hadronic tau decays: ATLAS meets the challenge</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>1309-1312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hadronic tau decays play a crucial role in taking Standard Model ({\bf SM}) measurements as well as in the search for physics beyond the {\bf SM}. However, hadronic tau decays are difficult to identify and trigger on due to their resemblance to {\bf QCD} jets. Given the large production crosssection of {\bf QCD} processes, designing and operating a trigger system to efficiently select hadronic tau decays, while maintaining the rate within the bandwidth limits, is a difficult challenge. This contribution will summarize the status and performance of the {\bf ATLAS} tau trigger system during the 2010–2011 data taking period. Different methods that have been explored to obtain the trigger efficiency curves from data will be shown. Finally, the status of the measurements, which include hadronic tau decays in the final state, will be summarized. In light of the vast statistics collected in 2011, future prospects for triggering on hadronic tau decays in this exciting new period of increased instantaneous luminosity will be presented.</p>

					<p>Supersymmetry ({\bf SUSY}) signatures are probed at the Large Hadron Collider with 7 TeV energy in the framework of {\bf CMSSM} with a new set of cuts based on event shapes and jet energy scales. It is showed that with our cuts, it is possible to probe a large portion of {\bf CMSSM} parameter space in situations, where the {\bf SUSY} cascade decay chain produces hard multijets $+$ missing energy.

				<abstract>
					<p>Analyticity and unitarity techniques are employed to estimate Taylor coefficients of the pion electromagnetic form factor at $t = 0$ by exploiting the recently evaluated two-pion contribution to the muon $(g − 2)$ and the phase of the pion electromagnetic form factor in the elastic region, known from $\pi \pi$ scattering by Fermi–Watson theorem and the values of the form factor at several points in the space-like region. Regions in the complex $t$-plane are isolated where the form factor cannot have zeros.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A search for the Standard Model ({\bf SM}) Higgs boson in the decay channel $H \rightarrow ZZ^{(\ast)} \rightarrow 4l$ with each $Z$ boson decaying to an electron or muon pair is presented using $pp$ collisions from the {\bf LHC} at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of $1.66 \pm 0.07$ fb$^{−1}$ recorded by the {\bf CMS} detector in 2010 and 2011. The search covers Higgs boson mass $(m_{\text{H}})$ hypotheses of $110 &#60; m_{\text{H}} &#60; 600$ GeV/c$^{2}$. Twenty-one events are observed, while $21.2 \pm 0.8$ events are expected from Standard Model (SM) background processes. The events are not clustered in mass excluding interpretation as the SM Higgs boson and its $(4l)$ mass distribution is consistent with the expectation of SM continuum production of $ZZ^{(\ast)}$ pairs. Upper limits at $95\%$ CL on the cross-section $\times$ branching ratio for a SM Higgs boson with SM like decays exclude cross-sections from about once to twice the expected SM cross-section for masses in the range of $150 &#60; m_{\text{H}}&#60; 420$ GeV/c$^{2}$.</p>

				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>1325-1329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new method is employed to measure the neutral current cross-section up to Bjorken $x$ values of 1 with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 187 pb$^{−1}$ of electron–proton collisions and 142 pb$^{−1}$ of positron–proton collisions, at a centre-of-mass energy of 318 GeV. Cross-sections have been extracted for $Q^{2}$ &gt; 575 GeV$^{2}$. A much improved precision with respect to the previous ZEUS publication, which used only 16.7 pb$^{−1}$ of electron–proton collisions and 65.1 pb$^{−1}$ of positron–proton collisions, is achieved, owing to the large data sample and improved kinematic reconstruction methods. The measurement is well-described by different theory predictions.</p>

				<title>Tau reconstruction, energy calibration and identification at ATLAS</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>1337-1340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tau leptons play a central role in the LHC physics programme, in particular as an important signature in many Higgs boson and supersymmetry searches. They are further used in Standard Model electroweak measurements, as well as detector-related studies like the determination of the missing transverse energy scale. Copious backgrounds from QCD processes call for both efficient identification of hadronically decaying tau leptons, as well as large suppression of fake candidates. A solid understanding of the combined performance of the calorimeter and tracking detectors is also required. We present the current status of the tau reconstruction, energy calibration and identification with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Identification efficiencies are measured in $W \rightarrow \tau \nu$ events in data and compared with predictions from Monte Carlo simulations, whereas the misidentification probabilities of QCD jets and electrons are determined from various jet-enriched data samples and from $Z \rightarrow ee$ events, respectively. The tau energy scale calibration is described and systematic uncertainties on both energy scale and identification efficiencies discussed.</p>

				<title>Quantitative assessment of target dependence of pion fluctuation in hadronic interactions – estimation through erraticity</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1395-1405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Event-to-event fluctuation pattern of pions produced by proton and pion beams is studied in terms of the newly defined erraticity measures $\chi (p, q)$, $\chi_{q}^{'}$ and $\mu_{q}^{'}$ proposed by Cao and Hwa. The analysis reveals the erratic behaviour of the produced pions signifying the chaotic multiparticle production in high-energy hadron–nucleus interactions ($\pi^{-}$ –AgBr interactions at 350 GeV/c and $p$–AgBr interactions at 400 GeV/c). However, the chaoticity does not depend on whether the projectile is proton or pion. The results are compared with the results of the VENUS-generated data for the above interactions which suggests that VENUS event generator is unable to reproduce the event-to-event fluctuations of spatial patterns of final states. A comparative study of $p$–AgBr interactions and $p–p$ collisions at 400 GeV/c from NA27, with the help of a quantitative parameter for the assessment of pion fluctuation, indicates conclusively that particle production process is more chaotic for hadron–nucleus interactions than for hadron–hadron interactions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using a unified description on multiplicity distributions of final-state particles, the transverse momentum distributions of identified particles produced in proton–proton $(pp)$, proton– and deuteron–nucleus $[p(d)A]$, and nucleus–nucleus $(AA)$ collisions at high energies are studied in this paper. We assume that the transverse momentum distributions of identified particles measured in final state are contributed by a few energy sources which can be regarded as partons or quarks in the interacting system. The particle is contributed by each source with gluons which have transverse momentum distributions in an exponential form. The modelling results are compared and found to be in agreement with the experimental data at high energies.</p>

				<title>Generation of tunable 16 $\mu$m radiation from CO$_{2}$ by cascade lasing</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1425-1441</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we propose a scheme to generate tunable 16 $\mu$m radiation from CO$_{2}$ molecules by cascade lasing. The stimulating 9.5 $\mu$m radiation is generated internally by the fast rotating mirror {\bf Q}-switching technique. The optical scheme proposed by us uses an intracavity prism to separate the 9.5 $\mu$m and the 16 $\mu$m beams. This facilitates independent tuning of the two beams if required. In the present configuration, only the 16 $\mu$m cavity is dispersive. The 9.5 $\mu$m beam grows spontaneously in a stable semiconfocal resonator. We have developed a theoretical model to simulate the proposed scheme. The model predicts the energy and power of 16 $\mu$m radiation. The calculated values are much higher than the previously obtained experimental values. The results point out the feasibility of developing a laser system based on the theoretical design parameters presented in this paper. Such laser systems can find application in uranium isotope separation studies.</p>

				<title>Influence of pseudorandom bit format on the direct modulation performance of semiconductor lasers</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1443-1456</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper investigates the direct gigabit modulation characteristics of semiconductor lasers using the return to zero ({\bf RZ}) and non-return to zero ({\bf NRZ}) formats. The modulation characteristics include the frequency chirp, eye diagram, and turn-on jitter ({\bf TOJ}). The differences in the relative contributions of the intrinsic noise of the laser and the pseudorandom bit-pattern effect to the modulation characteristics are presented. We introduce an approximate estimation to the transient properties that control the digital modulation performance, namely, the modulation bit rate and the minimum (setting) bit rate required to yield a modulated laser signal free from the bit pattern effect. The results showed that the frequency chirp increases with the increase of the modulation current under both {\bf RZ} and {\bf NRZ} formats, and decreases remarkably with the increase of the bias current. The chirp is higher under the RZ modulation format than under the NRZ format. When the modulation bit rate is higher than the setting bit rate of the relaxation oscillation, the laser exhibits enhanced {\bf TOJ} and the eye diagram is partially closed. {\bf TOJ} decreases with the increase of the bias and/or modulation current for both formats of modulation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper investigates the effects of heat transfer in MHD flow of viscoelastic stratified fluid in porous medium on a parallel plate channel inclined at an angle $\theta$. A laminar convection flow for incompressible conducting fluid is considered. It is assumed that the plates are kept at different temperatures which decay with time. The partial differential equations governing the flow are solved by perturbation technique. Expressions for the velocity of fluid and particle phases, temperature field, Nusselt number, skin friction and flow flux are obtained within the channel. The effects of various parameters like stratification factor, magnetic field parameter, Prandtl number on temperature field, heat transfer, skin friction, flow flux, velocity for both the fluid and particle phases are displayed through graphs and discussed numerically.</p>

				<title>Dynamic imaging and hydrodynamics study of high velocity, laser-accelerated thin foil targets using multiframe optical shadowgraphy</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1471-1483</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main aim of the study of thin target foil–laser interaction experiments is to understand the physics of hydrodynamics of the foil acceleration, which is highly relevant to inertial confinement fusion (ICF). This paper discusses a simple, inexpensive multiframe optical shadow-graphy diagnostics developed for dynamic imaging of high velocity laser-accelerated target foils of different thicknesses. The diagnostic has a spatial and temporal resolution of 12 $\mu$m and 500 ps respectively in the measurements. The target velocity is in the range of $10^{6} - 10^{7}$ cm/s. Hydrodynamic efficiency of such targets was measured by energy balance experiments together with the measurement of kinetic energy of the laser-driven targets. Effect of target foil thickness on the hydrodynamics of aluminum foils was studied for determining the optimum conditions for obtaining a directed kinetic energy transfer of the accelerated foil. The diagnostics has also been successfully used to study ablatively accelerated targets of other novel materials.</p>

				<title>The effect of impurity on transition frequency of bound polaron in quantum rods</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1485-1493</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Hamiltonian of a quantum rod with an ellipsoidal boundary is given after a coordinate transformation that changes the ellipsoidal boundary into a spherical one. The properties of the quantum rods constituting the bridge between two-dimensional quantum wells, zero-dimensional quantum dots and one-dimensional quantum wires are explored theoretically using linear combination operator method. The first internal excited state energy, the excitation energy and the transition frequency between the first internal excited and the ground states of the strong-coupled impurity-bound polaron in the rod with Coulomb-bound potential, the transverse effective confinement length, the ellipsoid aspect ratio and the electron–phonon coupling strength are studied. It is found that the first internal excited state energy, the excitation energy and the transition frequency are increasing functions of the Coulomb-bound potential and the electron–phonon coupling strength, whereas they are decreasing functions of the ellipsoid aspect ratio and the transverse effective confinement length. These results can be attributed to the interesting quantum size confining effects.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1495-1501</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Roulin $\mathit{et}$ $\mathit{al}$ (1988), in one of their experimental papers, have presented a study of field-dependent entropy of high-purity YBa$_{2}$ Cu$_{3}$ O$_{7−\delta}$ (YBCO) as a function of oxygen deficiency. In order to explain their experimental results, we have used phenomenological GL-theory of anisotropic HTSCs in the London limit in line with of our earlier paper (Pattanaik $\mathit{et}$ $\mathit{al}$, Physica {\bf B405}, 3234 (2010)). Moreover, to account for the applicability of the theory at high field, we have incorporated the effect of vortex overlapping in the London theory done by Nanda (1995). Here, we have presented the variation of change in entropy ($\Delta$S) with magnetic field for different oxygen deficiencies $\delta = 0$, 0.04, and 0.06. On comparison, we found that our results are in good agreement with the experimental data of Roulin $\mathit{et}$ $\mathit{al}$ (1988). The variation of penetration depth ($\lambda$) and anisotropic ratio of effective masses ($\gamma$) with concentration is also presented.</p>

				<title>Effect of different donors and a polymer environment on photophysical and energy transfer studies using C540 as the acceptor</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1503-1524</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dyes (C450, C480 and C540) and their dye mixtures (C450:C540 and C480:C540) were doped in polymer matrices (solid). Their photophysical studies were recorded. These results were analysed by comparing them with the data of the dyes and the dye mixtures in monomer compositions (liquid). The absorption and fluorescence spectral profiles of the dyes in the polymer matrix were found to be identical to those in the monomer compositions. The effect of different donors on the energy transfer technique using C540 as acceptor, in polymer matrix and monomer compositions, was studied in detail. The results obtained for the energy transfer technique in two binary dye mixtures containing different donors but same acceptor, in solid and liquid media, were intercompared. The gain of the acceptor without donor and with different donors was determined experimentally. The gain coefficient in the polymer matrix (solid) was less than that in the monomer medium (liquid). Also, the gain of the acceptor C540 was found to be more when C450 was used as the donor compared to that when C480 was used as the donor. Using nitrogen laser, the photobleaching effect in the two binary dye-doped polymer rods (with different donors but same acceptor) was studied. It was observed that photobleaching of the acceptor C540 in the presence of C450 as donor is slower than that in the presence of C480 as donor.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report a simple, non-intrusive fibre-optic refractometer sensor for measuring the refractive index of liquid and optically transparent solid medium. Sensing principle of the proposed sensor is based on monitoring the back-reflected light signal through the second input port of a $2 \times 1$ single-mode fibre coupler when light signal from the output port is focussed at the interface of air and a liquid or solid medium and back-reflected exactly along the same path. Depending on the refractive index of the medium, the amount of back-reflected intensity would vary and in the present work we exploit this principle to measure the refractive index of an optically transparent medium. Variation of refractive index as small as 0.001 {\bf RIU} can be measured with our proposed sensor.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of quantum interference in inter-conversion between cold atoms and diatomic molecules are analysed in this study. Within the framework of Fano’s theory, continuum bound anisotropic dressed state formalism of atom–molecule quantum dynamics is presented. This formalism is applicable in photo- and magneto-associative strong-coupling regimes. The significance of Fano effect in ultracold atom–molecule transitions is discussed. Quantum effects at low-energy atom–molecule interface are important for exploring coherent phenomena in hitherto unexplored parameter regimes.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we investigate the bifurcations and dynamic behaviour of travelling wave solutions of the Klein–Gordon–Zakharov equations given in Shang $\mathit{et} \mathit{al}, {\bf \mathit{Comput.

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we have obtained the solution of the unpolarized coupled Dokshitzer–Gribove–Lipatov–Alterelli–Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equation in leading order at the small-$x$ limit. Here, we have used a Taylor series expansion, separation of functions and then the method of characteristics to solve the evolution equations. We have also calculated $t$-evolution of singlet and gluon distribution functions and the results are compared with E665 and NNPDF data for singlet structure function and GRV1998 and MRST2004 gluon parametrizations. It is shown that our results are in good agreement with the parametrizations especially at small-x and high-$Q^{2}$ region. From global parametrizations and our results, we have seen that the singlet and gluon distribution functions increase when $Q^{2}$ increases for fixed values of $x$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The decay scheme of ${}^{76}$Br is established by the ${}^{76}$Br($T1/2 = 16.2$ h) $\bate^{+}$/EC study. The 1791.31 keV level, which was identified initially by Müller $\mathit{et al}$ with $^{76}$Se($p, p'$) reaction more than three decades ago, is reconfirmed. However, the spin and parity have not been assigned by Müller $\mathit{et al}$. Now we consider it reasonable to assign the 1791.31 keV level as a new candidate of the three-phonon multiplet in $^{76}$Se. In addition, in order to study the deformation of $^{76}$Se which lies in transitional region between strongly deformed and spherical nuclei, we calculate the total Routhian surfaces ({\bf TRS}) of positive-parity states by cranking shell model formalism.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The energy costs in the cold ternary fission of $^{252}$Cf for various light charged particle emission are calculated by includingWong's correction for Coulomb potential. Energy cost is found to be higher in cold fission than in normal fission. It is found that energy cost always increases with decrease in experimental yield in all the light charged particle emissions. The higher ground state deformation of the fragments, the odd–even effect and the enhanced yield in the octupole region observed in cold fission are found to be consistent with the concept of energy cost.</p>

				<title>Thermal-hydraulic analysis of LBE spallation target for accelerator-driven systems</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0089-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In an accelerator-driven subcritical system ({\bf ADS}), a high-performance spallation neutron source is used to feed the subcritical reactor. Neutron generation depends on the proton beam intensity. If the beam intensity is increased by a given factor, the number of generated neutrons will increase. The mechanism yielding a high rate of neutron production per energy is the spallation process, and this mechanism produces very high-energy deposition in the spallation target material. Producing a high rate of neutrons is accompanied by creation of problems of decay heat cooling and radiological protection. As a first step in designing a full-scale industrial {\bf ADS}, a small-scale experimental {\bf ADS}, which is similar to the European experimental {\bf ADS (XADS)} is analysed. The analysis presented in this paper is based on lead–bismuth eutectic ({\bf LBE}) cooled XADS-type experimental reactors, designed during the European experimental ({\bf PDS-XADS}) project. Computational fluid dynamics analysis has been carried out for the spallation target. Steady-state behaviour and shear stress transport turbulence model with the automatic wall treatment were applied in the present analysis.</p>

				<title>Neutronic simulation of a research reactor core of (${}^{232}$Th, ${}^{235}$U)O$_{2}$ fuel using MCNPX2.6 code</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0105-0120</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The small reactor design for the remote and less developed areas of the user countries should have simple features in view of the lack of infra-structure and resources. Many researchers consider long core life with no on-site refuelling activity as a primary feature for the small reactor design. Long core life can be achieved by enhancing internal conversion rate of fertile to fissile materials. For that purpose, thorium cycle can be adopted because a high fissile production rate of $^{233}$U converted from $^{232}$Th can be expected in the thermal energy region. A simple nuclear reactor core arranged 19 assemblies in hexagonal structure, using thorium-based fuel and heavy water as coolant and moderator was simulated using MCNPX2.6 code, aiming an optimized critical assembly. Optimized reflector thickness and gap between assemblies were determined to achieve minimum neutron leakage and void reactivity. The result was a more compact core, where assemblies were designed having 19-fuel pins in 1.25 pitch-to-diameter ratio. Optimum reflector thickness of 15 cm resulted in minimal neutron leakage in view of economic limitations. A 0.5 cm gap between assembles achieved more safety and $2.2\%$ enrichment requirements. The present feasibility study suggests a thermal core of acceptable neutronic parameters to achieve a simple and safe core.</p>

				<title>Antenna coupling study for ICWC plasma characterization in TEXTOR</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0121-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ion cyclotron wall conditioning (ICWC) discharges, in pulsed-mode operation, were carried out in the limiter tokamak TEXTOR to explore safe operational regimes for the experimental parameters for possible ICWC-discharge cleaning in International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) at half field. Antenna coupling properties obtained during the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) wall conditioning experiments performed in helium–hydrogen mixture in TEXTOR were analysed in relation to the obtained ICWC-plasma characterization results. Satisfactory antenna coupling in the mode conversion scenario along with reproducible generation of ICRF plasmas for wall conditioning, were achieved by coupling radio frequency (RF) power from one or two ICRF antennas. The plasma breakdown results obtained in the TEXTOR tokamak have been compared with the predictions of a zero-dimensional RF plasma production model. The present study of ICWC emphasizes the beneficial effect of application of an additional (along with toroidal magnetic field) stationary vertical ($B_{V} \ll B_{T}$) or oscillating poloidal magnetic field ($B_{P} \ll B_{T}$) on antenna coupling and relevant plasma parameters.</p>

				<title>Influence of argon plasma treatment on polyethersulphone surface</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0133-0141</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Polyethersulphone (PES) was modified to improve the hydrophilicity of its surface, which in turn helps in improving its adhesive property. The modified PES surface was characterized by contact angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Vicker’s microhardness measurement. The contact angles of the modified PES reduces from $49^{\circ}$ to $10^{\circ}$ for water. The surface free energy (SFE) calculated from measured contact angles increases from 66.3 to 79.5 mJ/m$^{2}$ with the increase in plasma treatment time. The increase in SFE after plasma treatment is attributed to the functionalization of the polymer surface with hydrophilic groups. The XPS analysis shows that the ratio of O/C increases from 0.177 to 0.277 for modified PES polymer. AFM shows that the average surface roughness increases from 6.9 nm to 23.7 nm due to the increase in plasma treatment time. The microhardness of the film also increases with plasma treatment.</p>

				<title>A model for the occurrence and analysis of ionic thermocurrent spectrum involving different orders of kinetics</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0143-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ionic thermocurrent ({\bf ITC}) spectrum is much similar to a thermoluminescence ({\bf TL}) glow curve involving monomolecular kinetics. It has already been reported that different orders of kinetics are involved in {\bf TL} processes, which depend specifically on the extent of recombination and simultaneous retrapping. It is found that the involvement of different orders of kinetics in {\bf ITC} spectrum depends on the experimental conditions of polarization and rate of rapid cooling. Consequently, order of kinetics involved in the {\bf ITC} spectrum does not represent any specific feature of the system under investigation. An equation is developed which explains the occurrence of {\bf ITC} spectrum involving any order of kinetics. Dielectric relaxation parameters, order of kinetics and approximate number of dipoles per unit volume are evaluated conveniently and easily following the proposed model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of the present work is to make a comparative study of the {\bf EXAFS} spectra recorded at the BL-8 dispersive {\bf EXAFS} beamline at 2 GeV Indus-2 synchrotron source at {\bf RRCAT}, Indore (India) with those recorded at other synchrotron {\bf EXAFS} beamlines, viz., {\bf X-19A} at {\bf NSLS}, {\bf BNL (USA)}, {\bf EXAFS} wiggler beamline 4-1 at the {\bf SSRL} ({\bf USA}) and beamline 11.1 at {\bf ELETTRA} (Italy). For this purpose, {\bf EXAFS} spectra at Cu K-edge in copper metal have been recorded at these four beamlines. Further, {\bf EXAFS} spectra at Cu K-edge in a copper complex have also been recorded at BL-8 beamline and beamline 11.1 at {\bf ELETTRA} (Italy). The obtained experimental $\mu(E)$ data have been background-subtracted and then normalized. The normalized data have been then converted to $\chi(k)$ data, which have been Fourier-transformed and then fitted with the theoretical model, thereby yielding different structural parameters. It has been shown that the results obtained from the {\bf EXAFS} spectra recorded at the {\bf BL-8} beamline are comparable with those obtained from other synchrotron {\bf EXAFS} beamlines and also with the crystallographic results reported by earlier workers. The reliability, usefulness and data quality of the {\bf BL-8} beamline have been discussed.</p>

				<title>Community detection using global and local structural information</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0173-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Community detection is of considerable importance for understanding both the structure and function of complex networks. In this paper, we introduced the general procedure of the community detection algorithms using global and local structural information, where the edge betweenness and the local similarity measures respectively based on local random walk dynamics and local cyclic structures were used. The algorithms were tested on artificial and real-world networks. The results clearly show that all the algorithms have excellent performance in the tests and the local similarity measure based on local random walk dynamics is superior to that based on local cyclic structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, Hawking radiation is studied from four-dimensional ({\bf 4D}) Kaluza–Klein {\bf (KK) AdS} black holes via the method of anomaly cancellation. The {|bf KK-AdS} black hole considered is a non-extremal charged rotating solution in the theory of {\bf 4D} gauged supergravity. Its Hawking fluxes of electric charge, angular momentum and energy momentum tensor are derived here. Our results support the common view that Hawking radiation is the quantum effect arising at the event horizon.</p>

				<title>Generalized entropy production fluctuation theorems for quantum systems</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0207-0222</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Based on trajectory-dependent path probability formalism in state space, we derive generalized entropy production fluctuation relations for a quantum system in the presence of measurement and feedback. We have obtained these results for three different cases: (i) the system is evolving in isolation from its surroundings; (ii) the system being weakly coupled to a heat bath; and (iii) system in contact with reservoir using quantum Crooks fluctuation theorem. In Case (iii), we build on the treatment carried out by {\bf H T Quan} and {\bf H Dong} [arXiv/cond-mat:0812.4955], where a quantum trajectory has been defined as a sequence of alternating work and heat steps. The obtained entropy production fluctuation theorems ({\bf FT}s) retain the same form as in the classical case. The inequality of second law of thermodynamics gets modified in the presence of information. These {\bf FT}s are robust against intermediate measurements of any observable performed with respect to von Neumann projective measurements as well as weak or positive operator-valued measurements.</p>

				<title>Complete switched modified function projective synchronization of a five-term chaotic system with uncertain parameters and disturbances</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0223-0235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A five-term three-dimensional (3D) autonomous chaotic system with an exponential nonlinear term is reported in this paper. Basic dynamical behaviours of the chaotic system are further investigated. Then a new synchronization phenomenon, complete switched modified function projective synchronization (CSMFPS), for this novel five-term chaotic system with uncertain parameters and disturbances is investigated. This paper extends previous work, where CSMFPS of chaotic systems means that all the state variables of the drive system synchronize with different state variables of the response system. As the synchronization scheme has many combined forms, it is a promising type of synchronization and can provide greater security in secure communication. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, a robust adaptive controller is contrived to acquire CSMFPS, parameter identification and suppress disturbances simultaneously. Finally, the Lorenz system and the new five-term chaotic system are taken as examples and the corresponding numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control scheme.</p>

					<p>The chiral constituent quark model ($\chi$ CQM) with general parametrization (GP) method has been formulated to calculate the quadrupole moments of the spin $-\dfrac{3}{2}^{+}$ decuplet baryons and spin $-\dfrac{3}{2}^{+} \rightarrow \dfrac{1}{2}^{+}$ transitions. The implications of such a model have been investigated in detail for the effects of symmetry breaking and GP parameters pertaining to the two- and three-quark contributions. It is found that the $\chi$CQM is successful in giving a quantitative and qualitative description of the quadrupole moments.</p>

				<title>Measurement, analysis and correction of the closed orbit distortion in Indus-2 synchrotron radiation source</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0263-0275</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presents the measurement, analysis and correction of closed orbit distortion ({\bf COD}) in Indus-2 at 550 MeV injection energy and 2 GeV synchrotron radiation user run energy. The measured {\bf COD} was analysed and fitted to understand major sources of errors in terms of the effective quadrupole misalignments. The rms {\bf COD} was corrected down to less than 0.6 mm in both horizontal and vertical planes. A golden orbit was set for the operating synchrotron radiation beamlines. With {\bf COD} correction, the injection efficiency at 550 MeV was improved by $\sim 50\%$ and the beam lifetime at 2 GeV was increased by $\sim8$ h. In this paper, the method of global {\bf COD} correction based on singular value decomposition ({\bf SVD}) of the orbit response matrix is described. Results for the {\bf COD} correction in both horizontal and vertical planes at 550 MeV injection energy and at 2 GeV synchrotron radiation user run energy are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Transport of high current ($\sim$kA range with particle energy $\sim 1$ MeV) planar electron beams is a topic of increasing interest for applications in high-power (1–10 GW) and high-frequency (10–20 GHz) microwave devices such as backward wave oscillator (BWO), klystrons, gyro-BWOs, etc. In this paper, we give a simulated result for transport of electron beams with velocity  $V_{b} = 5.23 \times 10^{8}$ cm s$^{−1}$ , relativistic factor $\gamma = 1.16$, and beam voltage = $\sim$80 kV in notched wiggler magnet array. The calculation includes self-consistent effects of beam-generated fields. Our results show that the notched wiggler configuration with $\sim$6.97 kG magnetic field strength can provide vertical and horizontal confinements for a sheet electron beam with 0.3 cm thickness and 2 cm width. The feasibility calculation addresses to a system expected to drive for 13–20 GHz BWO with rippled waveguide parameters as width $w = 3.0$ cm, thickness $t = 1.0$ cm, corrugation depth $h = 0.225$ cm, and spatial periodicity $d = 1.67$ cm.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Arbitrary amplitude dust-acoustic ({\bf DA}) solitary waves in an unmagnetized and collisionless quantum dusty plasma comprising cold dust particles, kappa ($\kappa$)-distributed ions and degenerate electrons are investigated. The influence of suprathermality and quantum effects on the linear dispersion relation of {\bf DA} waves is investigated. Then, the effect of $\kappa$-distributed ions and degenerate electrons on the existence domain of solitons is discussed in the space of ($M, f$). The comparison of the existence domain for higher and lower values of $\kappa$ shows that suprathermality results in propagation of solitons with lower values of Mach number, and the quantum effects, lead to a higher values of Mach number. The existence domain of solitons for nondegenerate $\kappa$-distributed electrons is considered for comparison with effect of degenerate electrons. Also, we found that the Sagdeev potential well becomes deeper and wider as $\varepsilon_{F-i}$ decreases, as for lower $\kappa$ values, the influence of quantum effects on the Sagdeev pseudopotential profile is smaller.</p>

				<title>A tentative model for estimating the compressibility of rock-salt AgCl$_{x}$ Br$_{1−x}$ alloys</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0307-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>${\textit{Ab initio}}$ detailed calculations of the elastic properties of AgCl$_{x} Br$_{1−x}$ alloys were recently made using density-functional perturbation theory and by employing the virtual crystal approximation or by means of the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method. Here, we suggest a simple theoretical model that enables estimation of isothermal compressibility of these alloys in terms of the elastic data of end-members alone. The calculated values are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental ones. The present model makes use of an early suggestion that interconnects Gibbs energy for the formation and/or migration of defects in solids with bulk properties.</p>

				<title>Effect of Al doping on microstructure and optical band gap of ZnO thin film synthesized by successive ion layer adsorption and reaction</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0315-0326</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thin films of pure and aluminum-doped zinc oxide ({\bf AZO}) were deposited on glass substrates from ammonium zincate bath following a chemical dipping technique called successive ion layer adsorption and reaction ({\bf SILAR}). Characterization techniques such as {\bf X-ray} diffraction ({\bf XRD}), scanning electron microscopy ({\bf SEM}) and energy-dispersive X-rays ({\bf EDX}) were used to investigate the effect of Al doping on the microstructure of {\bf AZO} films. Particle size analysis using {\bf X-ray} line broadening shows marginally increasing trend with increasing Al impurity. The average particle size for pure {\bf ZnO} is 22.75 nm. It increases to 24.26 nm for $1\%$ {\bf AZO} film and 25.13 nm for $2\%$ {\bf AZO} film. Incorporation of Al was confirmed from elemental analysis using {\bf EDX. SEM} micrograph shows that pure {\bf ZnO} particles are spherical shaped. However, {\bf AZO} films show particles with off-spherical shape with compact interconnected grains. The value of band gap for pure {\bf ZnO} is 3.229 eV and it increases to 3.29 eV for $1\%$ {\bf AZO} indicating a blue-shift for $1\%$ {\bf AZO} film. However, for $2\%$ {\bf AZO} film, a decrease in band gap compared to pure {\bf ZnO} is observed indicating a red-shift of fundamental absorption edge. Electrical resistance shows an initial decrease with increasing Al content. With further enhancement of Al incorporation, the resistance increases.</p>

				<title>Spin-dependent rectification in the C$_{59}$N molecule</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0327-0336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coherent spin-dependent electron transport is investigated in three conditions: (1) a C$_{60}$ molecule is connected to two ferromagnetic ({\bf FM}) electrodes symmetrically, (2) a C$_{59}$N molecule is connected to two {\bf FM} electrodes symmetrically and (3) a C$_{59}$N molecule is connected to two {\bf FM} electrodes asymmetrically. This work is based on a single-band tight-binding model Hamiltonian and the Green’s function approach with the Landauer–Buttiker formalism. Electrodes used in this study are semi-infinite {\bf FM} electrodes with finite cross-section. Obvious rectification effect is observed in the C$_{59}$ N molecule which is connected to the {\bf FM} electrodes asymmetrically. This effect is more in the P alignment of {\bf FM} electrodes than in {\bf AP} alignment of {\bf FM} electrodes. This study indicates that the rectification behaviour is due to the asymmetry in molecule and junctions. Also in this investigation tunnel magnetoresistance ({\bf TMR}) is calculated for these molecules. Asymmetry is observed in {\bf TMR} of C$_{59}$N which is coupled to the electrodes asymmetrically due to asymmetric junctions, but {\bf TMR} of C$_{60}$ is symmetric.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>With remarkable advances in reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks, uncovering complex network structure and function from these networks is becoming one of the most important topics in system biology. This work aims at studying the structure and function of {\textit{Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)}} metabolic network by complex network methods. We first generated a metabolite graph from the recently reconstructed high-quality {\textit{S. aureus}} metabolic network model. Then, based on `bow tie' structure character, we explain and discuss the global structure of {\textit{S. aureus}} metabolic network. The functional significance, global structural properties, modularity and centrality analysis of giant strong component in {\textit{S. aureus}} metabolic networks are studied.</p>

				<title>The Standard Model with one universal extra dimension</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0369-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effects of universal extra dimensions on Standard Model observables first arise at the one-loop level. The quantization of this class of theories is therefore essential in order to perform predictions. A comprehensive study of the $SU_{C}(3) \times SU_{L}(2) \times U_{Y}(1)$ Standard Model defined in a space-time manifold with one universal extra dimension, compactified on the oribifold $S^{1}/Z_{2}$, is presented. The fact that the four-dimensional Kaluza–Klein theory is subjected to two types of gauge transformations is stressed and its quantization under the basis of the BRST symmetry discussed. $A SU_{C}(3) \times SU_{L}(2) \times U_{Y}(1)$-covariant gauge-fixing procedure for the Kaluza–Klein excitations is introduced. The connection between gauge and mass eigenstate fields is established in an exact way. An exhaustive list of the explicit expressions for all physical couplings induced by the Yang–Mills, Currents, Higgs, and Yukawa sectors is presented. The one-loop renormalizability of the standard Green’s functions, which implies that the Standard Model observables do not depend on a cut-off scale, is stressed.</p>

					<p>How a proposed quantum nonlocal phenomenon could be incompatible with the requirements of special relativity is studied. To show this, the least set of assumptions about the formalism and the interpretation of non-relativistic quantum theory is considered. Then, without any reference to the collapse assumption or any other stochastic processes, an experiment is proposed, involving two quantum systems, that interacted at an arbitrary time, with results which seem to be in conflict with requirements of special relativity.</p>

					<p>It is shown that a scalar field, minimally coupled to gravity, may have collapsing modes even when the energy condition is violated, that is, for $($\rho$ + 3p) &#60; 0$. This result may be useful in the investigation of the possible clustering of dark energy. All the examples dealt with have apparent horizons formed before the formation of singularity. The singularities formed are shell focussing in nature. The density of the scalar field distribution is seen to diverge at singularity. The Ricci scalar also diverges at the singularity. The interior spherically symmetric metric is matched with exterior Vaidya metric at the hypersurface and the appropriate junction conditions are obtained.</p>

					<p>It is showed that the fully nonlinear evolution equations of Olver and Rosenau can be reduced to Hamiltonian form by transformation of variables. The resulting Hamiltonian equations are treated by the dynamical systems theory and a phase-space analysis of their singular points is presented. The results of this study demonstrate that the equations can support double compactons. The new Olver–Rosenau compactons are different from the well-known Rosenau–Hyman compacton and Cooper–Shepard–Sodano compacton, because they are induced by a singular elliptic instead of singular straight line on phase-space.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The propagation of $\sigma$-meson in nuclear matter is studied in the Walecka model, by assuming that the sigma couples to a pair of nucleon–antinucleon states and to particle–hole states. The in-medium effect of $\sigma -\omega$ mixing is also studied. For completeness, the coupling of sigma to two virtual pions was also considered.

				<title>Analysis of thermal distribution in two end pumping Nd:YAG laser rod using bacterial foraging optimization algorithm</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0487-0505</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is a strong need for the optimized management of the thermal problem in {\bf Nd:YAG} laser rod and for a powerful, fast, and accurate modelling tool capable of treating the heat source distribution very close to what it actually is. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm called bacterial foraging optimization algorithm ({\bf BFOA}) is proposed for simulation of the radial heat distribution. {\bf A BFOA} discloses a simulation method which delivers the exact temperature distribution in a circularly cylindrical structure with a circularly symmetrical, longitudinally, and transversally non-uniform heat source distribution and circularly symmetrical cooling means. The output power is obtained and compared with previously published experimental measurements for different pump power and a good agreement has been found.</p>

				<title>Generation of uniform atmospheric pressure argon glow plasma by dielectric barrier discharge</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0507-0517</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, atmospheric pressure glow discharges (APGD) in argon generated in parallel plate dielectric barrier discharge system is investigated by means of electrical and optical measurements. Using a high voltage (0–20 kV) power supply operating at 10–30 kHz, homogeneous and steady APGD has been observed between the electrodes with gap spacing from 0.5 mm to 2 mm and with a dielectric barrier of thickness 2 mm while argon gas is fed at a controlled flow rate of 11/min. The electron temperature and electron density of the plasma are determined by means of optical emission spectroscopy. Our results show that the electron density of the discharge obtained is of the order of 10$^{16}$ cm$^{−3}$ while the electron temperature is estimated to be 0.65 eV. The important result is that electron density determined from the line intensity ratio method and stark broadening method are in very good agreement. The Lissajous figure is used to estimate the energy deposited to the glow discharge. It is found that the energy deposited to the discharge is in the range of 20 to 25 $\\mu$J with a discharge voltage of 1.85 kV. The energy deposited to the discharge is observed to be higher at smaller gas spacing. The glow discharge plasma is tested to be effective in reducing the hydrophobicity of polyethylene film significantly.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we study the head-on collision between two dust-ion-acoustic ({\bf DIA}) solitons in quantum electron-dust-ion plasma. Using the extended Poincaré–Lighthill–Kuo ({\bf PLK}) method, we obtain the Korteweg–de Vries ({\bf KdV}) equations, the phase shifts and the trajectories after the head-on collision of the two {\bf DIA} solitons. We investigate the effect of quantum diffraction parameters for electrons and ions $(H_{e}, H_{i})$, the Fermi temperature ratio $(\sigma)$ and the dust charged number density $(n_{\text{d0}})$ on the phase shifts. Different values of $\mu = z_{\text{d0}}(n_{\text{d0}}/n_{\text{i0}})$ and $\mu_{\text{d}} = z_{\text{d0}}(m_{\text{i}}/m_{\text{d}})$ are taken to discuss the effects on phase shifts, where $z_{\text{d0}}$ denotes the dust charge number, $n_{\text{j0}}$represents the equilibrium number density and $m_{j}$ is the mass of the jth species ($j = e, i , d$ for electrons, ions and dust particles, respectively). It is observed that the phase shifts are significantly affected by the plasma parameters.</p>

					<p>This paper is concerned with the Nagumo equation with nonlinear degenerate diffusion and convection which arises in several problems of population dynamics, chemical reactions and others. A sharp front-type solution with a minimum speed to this model equation is analysed using different methods. One of the methods is to solve the travelling wave equations and compute an exact solution which describes the sharp travelling wavefront. The second method is to solve numerically an initial-moving boundary-value problem for the partial differential equation and obtain an approximation for this sharp front-type solution.</p>

				<title>Real gauge singlet scalar extension of the Standard Model: A possible candidate for cold dark matter</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0539-0557</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The simplest extension of Standard Model ({\bf SM}) is considered in which a real {\bf SM} gauge singlet scalar with an additional discrete symmetry $Z_{2}$ is introduced to {\bf SM}. This additional scalar can be a viable candidate of cold dark matter ({\bf CDM}) since the stability of $S$ is achieved by the application of $Z_{2}$ symmetry on $S$. Considering $S$ as a possible candidate of {\bf CDM}, Boltzmann’s equation is solved to find the freeze-out temperature and relic density of $S$ for Higgs mass 120 GeV in the scalar mass range 5 GeV to 1 TeV. As {\bf HHSS} coupling $\delta_{2}$ appearing in Lagrangian depends upon the value of scalar mass $m_{S}$ and Higgs mass $m_{h}$, the $m_{S} − \delta_{2}$ parameter space has been constrained by using the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ({\bf WMAP}) limit on the relic density of {\bf DM} in the Universe and the results of recent ongoing {\bf DM} direct search experiments, namely {\bf CDMS-II, CoGeNT, DAMA, EDELWEISS-II, XENON-10 and XENON-100.} From such analyses, two distinct mass regions are found (a lower and higher mass domain) for such a {\bf DM} candidate that satisfy both the {\bf WMAP} limit and the experimental results considered here. The possible differential direct detection rates and annual variation of total detection rates have been estimated for this scalar {\bf DM} candidate $S$ for two detector materials, namely {\bf Ge} and {\bf Xe}. Finally, the $\gamma$-ray flux has been calculated from the galactic centre due to annihilation of two 130 GeV scalar {\bf DM} into two monoenergetic $\gamma$-rays.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we derive Lie point, generalized, master and time-dependent symmetries of a dispersionless equation, which is an extension of a classical long wave system. This equation also admits an infinite-dimensional Lie algebraic structure of Virasoro-type, as in the dispersive integrable systems. We discuss the construction of a sequence of negative ranking symmetries through the property of uniformity in rank. More interestingly, we obtain the conserved quantities directly from the casimir of Poisson pencil.</p>

					<p>It is proved that the maximum eigenvalue sequence of the principal submatrices of coupling matrix is decreasing. The method of calculating the number of pinning nodes is given based on this theory. The findings reveal the relationship between the decreasing speed of maximum eigenvalue sequence of the principal submatrices for coupling matrix and the synchronizability on complex networks via pinning control. We discuss the synchronizability on some networks, such as scale-free networks and small-world networks. Numerical simulations show that different pinning strategies have different pinning synchronizability on the same complex network, and the synchronizability with pinning control is consistent with one without pinning control in various complex networks.</p>

Nuclear photographic emulsion technique has been employed to collect the experimental data. The presence of such substructures, their average behaviour, their size, and their position of occurrence have been examined. The experimental results have also been compared with the results simulated by Monte-Carlo method. The analysis strongly indicates the presence of ring- and jet-like structures in the experimental distributions of particles beyond statistical noise. The experimental results are in good agreement with I M Dremin idea, that the phenomenon is similar to the emission of Cherenkov electromagnetic radiation.</p>

				<title>Collision and recombination driven instabilities in variable charged dusty plasmas</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0643-0664</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dust-acoustic instability driven by recombination of electrons and ions on the surface of charged and variably-charged dust grains as well as by collisions in dusty plasmas with significant pressure of background neutrals have been theoretically investigated. The recombination driven instability is shown to be dominant in the long wavelength regime even in the presence of dust-neutral and ion-neutral collisions, while in the shorter wavelength regime, the dust-neutral collision is found to play a major role. In an earlier research work, the dust-neutral collision was neglected in comparison to the effect due to the recombination for estimating the dust-acoustic instability; later the other report shows that the recombination effect is negligible in the presence of dust-neutral collisions. In line of this present situation our investigation revealed that the recombination is more important than dust-neutral collisions in laboratory plasma and fusion plasma, while the dust-neutral collision frequency is dominant in the interstellar plasmas. The effects of ion and dust densities and ion streaming on the recombination and collision driven mode in parameter regimes relevant for many experimental studies on dusty plasmas have also been calculated.</p>

				<title>Effect of superthermal electrons on dust-acoustic Gardner solitons in nonplanar geometry</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0665-0676</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The properties of nonplanar (cylindrical and spherical) dust-acoustic solitary waves (DASWs) in an unmagnetized, collisionless three-component dusty plasma, whose constituents are negatively charged cold dust fluid, superthermal/non-Maxwellian electrons (represented by kappa distribution) and Boltzmann distributed ions, are investigated by deriving the modified Gardner (MG) equation. The well-known reductive perturbation method is employed to derive the MG equation. The basic features of nonplanar DA Gardner solitons (GSs) are discussed. It is seen that the properties of nonplanar DAGSs (positive and negative) significantly differ as the value of spectral index $\kappa$ changes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper reports an analysis of the effect of spatial plasma nonuniformity on absolute parametric instability ({\bf API}) of electrostatic waves in magnetized plane waveguides subjected to an intense high-frequency ({\bf HF}) electric field using the separation method. In this case the effect of strong static magnetic field is considered. The problem of strong magnetic field is solved in {\bf 1D} nonuniform plane plasma waveguide. The equation describing the spatial part of the electric potential is obtained. Also, the growth rates and conditions of the parametric instability for periodic and aperiodic cases are obtained. It is found that the spatial nonuniformity of the plasma exerts a stabilizing effect on the {\bf API}. It is shown that the growth rates of periodic and aperiodic {\bf API} in nonuniform plasma are less compared to that of uniform plasma.</p>

				<title>Arc plasma devices: Evolving mechanical design from numerical simulation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0685-0699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wide ranges of technological applications involve arc plasma devices as the primary plasma source for processing work. Recent findings exhibit the existence of appreciable thermal non-equilibrium in these so-called thermal plasma devices. Commercially available magnetohydrodynamic codes are not capable of handling such systems due to unavailability of non-equilibrium thermodynamic and transport property data and self-consistent models. A recipe for obtaining mechanical design of arc plasma devices from numerical simulation incorporating two-temperature thermal non-equilibrium model is presented in this article with reference to the plasma of the mixture of molecular gases like nitrogen and oxygen. Such systems are technologically important as they correspond to the plasma devices operating with air, oxygen plasma torches in cutting industries and plasma devices using nitrogen as shielding gas. Temperature field, associated fluid dynamics and electrical characteristics of a plasma torch are computed in a systematic manner to evaluate the performance of a conceived design using a two-fluid {\bf CFD} model coupled with a two-temperature thermodynamic and transport property code. Important effects of different nozzle designs and plasma gases obtained from the formalism are discussed. Non-equilibrium thermo-dynamic properties are computed using modified two-temperature Saha equations and transport properties are computed using standard Chapman–Enskog approach.</p>

					<p>Depth-sensitive polarized neutron scattering in specular and off-specular mode has recently revealed that perpendicular field cycling brings about a modification in the interfacial magnetization of a trained exchange coupled interface. We show here by various model fits to our neutron reflectivity data that a restoration of the untrained state is not possible in the case of our polycrystalline multilayer specimen. This is due to the magnetic moment at the interface induced only after perpendicular field cycling, changing the initial field-cooled state.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the effect of electromagnetic field in the string Bianchi type-VI$_{0}$ Universe is investigated. Einstein’s field equations have been solved exactly with suitable physical assumptions for two types of strings: (i) massive strings and (ii) Nambu strings. It is found that when the Universe is dominated by massive strings, the existence of electromagnetic field is necessary as it accelerates the expansion of the Universe. But when our Universe is dominated by Nambu strings, the electromagnetic field does not have significant effect on the evolution of the Universe. We have also shown that the early massive string-dominated Universe got converted to Nambu string-dominated Universe later. Our models are derived from an early deceleration phase to an accelerating phase which is consistent with the recent observations of supernovae type-Ia. The physical and geometrical behaviour of these models are also discussed.</p>

Using the Lie point symmetries, it is showed how to reduce Gordon-type wave equations using the method of invariants, and to obtain exact solutions corresponding to some boundary values. The Noether point symmetries and conservation laws are obtained for the Klein–Gordon equation in one case.

				<abstract>
					<p>The two-dimensional nonlinear physical models and coupled nonlinear systems such as Maccari equations, Higgs equations and Schrödinger–KdV equations have been widely applied in many branches of physics. So, finding exact travelling wave solutions of such equations are very helpful in the theories and numerical studies. In this paper, the Kudryashov method is used to seek exact travelling wave solutions of such physical models. Further, three-dimensional plots of some of the solutions are also given to visualize the dynamics of the equations. The results reveal that the method is a very effective and powerful tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations arising in mathematical physics.</p>

				<title>Collapse revival behaviour of the entanglement between V-type three-level atoms and two-mode photons in nonlinear Jaynes–Cummings model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0785-0796</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper the time evolution of von Neumann entropy, as a measure of entanglement between V-type three-level atoms and the union of a two-mode field, is studied. The atom–field interaction is assumed to occur in a Kerr-type medium with an intensity-dependent coupling. Introducing a Casmir operator whose eigenvalues, $N$, give total excitations in the system and commutes with the governing Hamiltonian, it is concluded that the latter is block-diagonal with ever growing dimensions. As we shall show, however, each block consists of two $2 \times 2$ blocks while all the others, $(N −1)$ in number, are $3 \times 3$. We then proceed to analytically calculate the time-evolution operator which is also block-diagonal, each block with the same properties as that of the Hamiltonian. Our calculations show that, as expected, the atom–field entanglement oscillates which, depending upon the initial state, exhibits the phenomenon of collapse revivals. It is further shown that collapse revivals occur whenever both $2 \times 2$ blocks are involved in the time evolution of the system. Properties of such behaviour in the entanglement are also discussed in detail.</p>

				<title>Confinement, average forces, and the Ehrenfest theorem for a one-dimensional particle</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0797-0810</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The topics of confinement, average forces, and the Ehrenfest theorem are examined for a particle in one spatial dimension. Two specific cases are considered: (i) A free particle moving on the entire real line, which is then permanently confined to a line segment or `a box' (this situation is achieved by taking the limit $V_{0} \rightarrow \infty$ in a finite well potential). This case is called `a particle-in-an-infinite-square-well-potential'. (ii) A free particle that has always been moving inside a box (in this case, an external potential is not necessary to confine the particle, only boundary conditions). This case is called `a particle-in-a-box'. After developing some basic results for the problem of a particle in a finite square well potential, the limiting procedure that allows us to obtain the average force of the infinite square well potential from the finite well potential problem is re-examined in detail. A general expression is derived for the mean value of the external classical force operator for a particle-in-an-infinite-square-well-potential, $\hat{F}$. After calculating similar general expressions for the mean value of the position ($\hat{X}$) and momentum ($\hat{P}$) operators, the Ehrenfest theorem for a particle-in-an-infinite-square-well-potential (i.e., $d\langle \hat{X} \rangle /dt = \langle \hat{P} \rangle /M$ and $d\langle \hat{P} \rangle /dt = \langle \hat{F} \rangle$) is proven. The formal time derivatives of the mean value of the position ($\hat{x}$) and momentum ($\hat{p}$) operators for a particle-in-a-box are re-introduced. It is verified that these derivatives present terms that are evaluated at the ends of the box. Specifically, for the wave functions satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition, the results, $d\langle \hat{x} \rangle /dt = \langle \hat{p} \rangle /M$ and $d\langle \hat{p} \rangle /dt = b.t. + \langle \hat{f} \rangle$, are obtained where b.t. denotes a boundary term and $\hat{f}$ is the external classical force operator for the particle-in-a-box. Thus, it appears that the expected Ehrenfest theorem is not entirely verified. However, by considering a normalized complex general state that is a combination of energy eigen-states to the Hamiltonian describing a particle-in-a-box with $\nu(x) = 0(\Rightarrow \hat{f} = 0)$, the result that the b.t. is equal to the mean value of the external classical force operator for the particle-in-an-infinite-square-well-potential is obtained, i.e., $d\langle \hat{p} \rangle /dt$ is equal to $\langle \hat{F} \rangle$. Moreover, the b.t. is written as the mean value of a quantity that is called boundary quantum force, $f_{B}$. Thus, the Ehrenfest theorem for a particle-in-a-box can be completed with the formula $d\langle \hat{p} \rangle /dt = \langle f_{B} \rangle$.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0825-0835</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, projective synchronization of double–scroll attractor of an extended Bonöffer–van der Pol oscillator ({\bf BVPO}) is considered via the backstepping and active control techniques. In each synchronization scheme, a single control function is designed to achieve projective synchronization between two Bonhöffer–van der Pol oscillator evolving from different initial conditions. To obtain a single control function via the active control, the coefficient of the error dynamics is chosen such that the number of control functions is reduced from three to one, thereby, reducing control function complexity in design. The results show that the transient error dynamics convergence and synchronization time are achieved faster via the backstepping than that of the active control technique. However, the control function obtained via the active control is simpler with a more stable synchronization time and hence, it is more suitable for practical implementation. Numerical simulations are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the analytical results.</p>

				<title>Investigation of the zenith angle dependence of cosmic-ray muons at sea level</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0837-0846</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Angular distribution of cosmic-ray muons at sea level has been investigated using the Geant4 simulation package. The model used in the simulations was tested by comparing the simulation results with the measurements made using the Berkeley Lab cosmic ray detector. Primary particles’ energy and fluxes were obtained from the experimental measurements. Simulations were run at each zenith angle starting from $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ up to $\theta = 70^{\circ}$ with $5^{\circ}$ increment. The angular distribution of muons at sea level has been estimated to be in the form $I(\theta) = I(0^{\circ}) \cos^{n}(\theta)$, where $I(0^{\circ})$ is the muon intensity at $0^{\circ}$ and $n$ is a function of the muon momentum. The exponent $n = 1.95 \pm 0.08$ for muons with energies above 1 GeV is in good agreement, within error, with the values reported in the literature.</p>

					<p>The effect of isovector coupling channel on the macroscopic part of the nuclear binding energy is studied using the relativistic density-dependent Thomas–Fermi approach.

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the beam lifetime measurement and its theoretical analysis are presented using measured vacuum pressure and applied radio frequency (RF) cavity voltage in Indus-2 electron storage ring at 2 GeV beam energy. Experimental studies of the effect of RF cavity voltage and bunched beam filling pattern on beam lifetime are also presented. An equation of stable beam current decay is evolved and this equation closely follows the observed beam current decay pattern. It shows that the beam is stable and the beam current decay is due to the beam–residual gas interaction (vacuum lifetime) and electron–electron interaction within a bunch (Touschek lifetime). The estimated vacuum, Touschek and total beam lifetimes from analytical formulations are also compared with the measured beam lifetime.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0873-0885</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The term `thermal flux' implies a Maxwellian distribution of velocity and energy corresponding to the most probable velocity of 2200 ms$^{−1}$ at 293.4 K. In order to measure the thermal neutron flux density, the foil activation method was used. Thermal neutron flux determination in paraffin phantom by counting the emitted rays of indium foils with two different detectors (Geiger–Muller counter and NaI(Tl)) was the aim of this project. The relative differences of the outcome of the experiments were between $2.5\%$ and $5\%$. The final results were compared with MCNP4C outputs and the best agreement was generated using NaI(Tl) by a minimum discrepancy of about $0.6\%$ for the foil placed 8.5 cm from the neutron source.</p>

					<p>The optical properties of a one-dimensional (1D) photonic heterostructure with gradedindex nonlinear materials are demonstrated theoretically. The influence of the gradation profile of the graded-index nonlinear layers on the linear and nonlinear responses of the structure are analysed. It is shown that the $Q$-factor of the defect mode and the threshold input intensity to achieve the optical bistability in the used photonic heterostructure depend on the gradation profile of the gradedindex nonlinear layers.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A microcrack in a silicon single crystal was experimentally investigated using highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). In particular, the numerical Moiré (NM) method was used to visualize the deformations and defects. The lattice structure of the microcrack was carefully observed at the nanoscale. HRTEM images of the microcrack demonstrated that the lattice structure of most of the microcrack regions is regular with good periodicity. In addition, the microcrack cleavage expands alternately along different crystal planes, where the principal cleavage plane is the (1 1 1) crystal plane. The NM maps showed no sharp plastic deformation around the microcrack, but discrete edge dislocations can be found only near the crack tip.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the unidirectional ant traffic flow with U-turn in an ant trail was investigated using one-dimensional cellular automata model. It is known that ants communicate with each other by dropping a chemical, called pheromone, on the substrate. Apart from the studies in the literature, it was considered in the model that (i) ant colony consists of two kinds of ants, goodand poor-smelling ants, (ii) ants might make U-turn for some special reasons. For some values of densities of good- and poor-smelling ants, the flux and mean velocity of the colony were studied as a function of density and evaporation rate of pheromone.</p>

					<p>In this paper the Kepler problem in the non-commutative Snyder scenario was studied. The deformations were characterized in the Poisson bracket algebra under a mimic procedure from quantum standard formulations by taking into account a general recipe to build the noncommutative phase space coordinates (in the sense of Poisson brackets). An expression for the deformed potential was obtained, and then the consequences in the precession of the orbit of Mercury were calculated. The result could be used for finding an estimated value for the non-commutative deformation parameter.</p>

				<page>0953-0970</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The positive-parity bands in ${}^{224−234}$Th are studied using the projected shell model (PSM) approach. The energy levels, deformation systematics, $B(E2)$ transition probabilities and nuclear $g$-factors are calculated and compared with the experimental data. The calculation reproduces the observed positive-parity yrast bands and $B(E2)$ transition probabilities. Measurement of $B(E2)$ transition probabilities for higher spins and $g$-factors would be a stringent test for our predictions. The results of theoretical calculations indicate that the deformation systematics in ${}^{224−234}$Th isotopes depend on the occupation of low $k$ components of high j orbits in the valence space and the deformation producing tendency of the neutron–proton interaction operating between spin orbit partner (SOP) orbits, the $[(2g_{9/2})_{\pi} - (2g_{7/2})_{\nu}]$ and $[(1i_{13/2})_{\pi} - (1i_{11/2})_{\nu}]$ SOP orbits in the present context. In addition, the deformation systematics also depend on the polarization of $(1h_{11/2})_{\pi}$ orbit. The low-lying states of yrast spectra are found to arise from 0-quasiparticle (qp) intrinsic states whereas the high-spin states turn out to possess composite structure.</p>

				<page>0971-0981</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is proposed to build a drift tube Linac (DTL) at Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore, India, that will form a part of the future Spallation Neutron Source. This DTL will accelerate 30 mA H-ion beam from 3 MeV to 10 MeV. The DTL is designed to operate at 352.2 MHz with a maximum duty cycle of $3\%$. The DTL tank will consist of three sections, each about 1.2 m in length having 60 cells. The DTL has a ramped accelerating field, which is ramped in the first section of DTL from 1.8 to 2.2 MV/m and remains constant over the rest of the length of DTL. The field in DTL will be stabilized using post-couplers. The three-dimensional (3D) design of the DTL is done using CST microwave studio (CST MWS) incorporating the various nonaxisymmetric components such as tuners, post-couplers and vacuum ports. The frequency shifts due to these components have been evaluated. This paper presents the details of the studies and analysis of 3D simulations of post-couplers, tuners and vacuum ports.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Energy calibration of superheated droplet detector is discussed in terms of the effective recoil nucleus threshold energy and the reduced superheat. This provides a universal energy calibration curve valid for different liquids used in this type of detector. Two widely used liquids, {\bf R114} and C$_{4}$F$_{10}$, one for neutron detection and the other for weakly interacting massive particles ({\bf WIMP}s) dark matter search experiment, have been compared. Liquid having recoil nuclei with larger values of linear energy transfer ({\bf LET}) provides better neutron-$\gamma$ discrimination. Gamma ($\gamma$) response of C$_{4}$F$_{10}$ has also been studied and the results are discussed. Behaviour of nucleation parameter with the effective recoil nucleus threshold energy and the reduced superheat have been explored.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0995-1010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have theoretically investigated the high harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of H$_{2}^{+}$ and HD$^{+}$ using a time-dependent wave packet approach for the nuclear motion with pulsed lasers of peak intensities $(I_{0})$ of $3.5 \times 10^{14}$ and $4.5 \times 10^{14}$ W/cm$^{2}$, wavelengths ($\lambda_{L}$) of 800 and 1064 nm, and pulse durations $(T)$ of 40 and 50 fs, for initial vibrational levels $\nu_{0} = 0$ and 1. We have argued that for these conditions the harmonic generation due to the transitions in the electronic continuum by tunnelling or multiphoton ionization will not be important. Thus, the characteristic features of HHG spectra in our model arise only due to the nuclear motions on the two lowest field-coupled electronic states between which both interelectronic and intraelectronic (due to intrinsic dipole moments, for HD$^{+}$) radiative transitions can take place. For HD$^{+}$, the effect of nonadiabatic (NA) interaction between the two lowest Born–Oppenheimer (BO) electronic states has been taken into account and comparison has been made with the HHG spectra of HD$^{+}$ obtained in the BO approximation. Even harmonics and a second plateau in the HHG spectra of HD$^{+}$ with the NA interaction and hyper-Raman lines in the spectra of both H$_{2}^{+}$ and HD$^{+}$ for $\nu_{0} = 1$ have been observed for higher value of $I_{0}$ or $\lambda_{L}$. Our calculations indicate reasonable efficiencies of harmonic generation even without involving the electronic continuum.</p>

				<title>Temperature profile evolution in quenching high-$T_{c}$ superconducting composite tape</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1011-1016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Irreversible normal zones leading to quench is an important aspect of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) in all practical applications. As a consequence of quench, transport current gets diverted to the matrix stabilizer material of the high-$T_{c}$ composite and causes Joule heating till the original conditions are restored. The nature of growth of the resistive zone in the superconductor greatly influences the temperature evolution of the quenched zone. In this investigation, a complete mathematical analysis of the temperature profile evolution following a quench in a HTS has been carried out. Such prediction in temperature profile would aid the design of HTS tape-based practical applications in limiting the thermal stress-induced damages in off-normal scenarios.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A model Hamiltonian is proposed for heat conduction in a nonlinear lattice with squared on-site potential using the second quantized operators and averaging the same using a suitable wave function, equations are derived in discrete form for the field amplitude and the properties of heat transfer are examined theoretically. Numerical analysis shows that the propagation of heat is in the form of solitons. Furthermore, a systemized version of tanh method is carried out to extract solutions for the resulting nonlinear equations in the continuum case and the effect of inhomogeneity is studied for different temperatures.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear propagation of dust-acoustic solitary waves in a dusty plasma with arbitrarily charged dust and trapped electrons</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1031-1039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A theoretical investigation of dust-acoustic solitary waves in three-component unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of trapped electrons, Maxwellian ions, and arbitrarily charged cold mobile dust was done. It has been found that, owing to the departure from the Maxwellian electron distribution to a vortex-like one, the dynamics of small but finite amplitude dust-acoustic ({\bf DA}) waves is governed by a nonlinear equation of modified Korteweg–de Vries ({\bf mKdV}) type (instead of {\bf KdV}). The reductive perturbation method was employed to study the basic features (amplitude, width, speed, etc.) of {\bf DA} solitary waves which are significantly modified by the presence of trapped electrons. The implications of our results in space and laboratory plasmas are briefly discussed.</p>

				<title>Vibrational properties of vacancy in bcc transition metals using embedded atom method potentials</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1041-1054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The embedded atom method ({\bf EAM}) potentials, with the universal form of the embedding function along with the Morse form of pair potential, have been employed to determine the potential parameters for three bcc transition metals: Fe, Mo, and W, by fitting to Cauchy pressure $(C_{12} − C_{44})/2$, shear constants $G_{v} = (C_{11} − C_{12} + 3C_{44})/5$ and $C_{44}$, cohesive energy and the vacancy formation energy. The obtained potential parameters are used to calculate the phonon dispersion spectra of these metals. Large discrepancies are found between the calculated results of phonon dispersion using the {\bf EAM} and the experimental phonon dispersion results. Therefore, to overcome this inadequacy of the {\bf EAM} model, we employ the modified embedded atom method ({\bf MEAM}) in which a modified term along with the pair potential and embedding function is added in the total energy. The phonon dispersions calculated using potential parameters obtained from the {\bf MEAM} show good agreement with experimental results compared to those obtained from the {\bf EAM}. Using the calculated phonons, we evaluate the local density of states of the neighbours of vacancy using the Green’s function method. The local frequency spectrum of first neighbours of vacancy in {\bf Mo} shows an increase at higher frequencies and a shift towards the lower frequencies whereas in {\bf Fe} and {\bf W}, the frequency spectrum shows a small decrease towards higher frequency and small shift towards lower frequency. For the second neighbours of vacancy in all the three metals, the local frequency spectrum is not much different from that of the host atom. The local density of states of the neighbours of the vacancy has been used to calculate the mean square displacements and the formation entropy of vacancy. The calculated mean square displacements of the first neighbours of vacancy are found to be higher than that of the host atom, whereas it is lower for the second neighbours. The calculated results of the formation entropy of the vacancy compared well with other available results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>${}^{1}$H MAS NMR spectra of Bi$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.05}$Y$_{0.90}$PO$_{4}$·$x$H$_{2}$O show chemical shift from −0.56 ppm at 300 K to −3.8 ppm at 215 K and another one at 5–6 ppm, which are related to the confined or interstitial water in the hexagonal structure and water molecules on the surface of the particles, respectively. Negative value of the chemical shift indicates that H of {\bf H$_{2}$O} is closer to metal ions (Y$^{3+}$ or Eu$^{3+}$), which is a source of luminescence quencher. H coupling and decoupling $^{31}$P MAS NMR spectra at 300 and 250 K show the same chemical shift (−0.4 ppm) indicating that there is no direct bond between P and H. It is concluded that the confined water is not frozen even at 215 K because of the less number of H-bonding.</p>

				<title>Durability of rewritable phase-change Ge$_{X}$Sb$_{Y}$ Te$_{1−X−Y}$ memory devices</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1065-1081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The bond constraint theory (BCT) dealing with the rigidity caused by bond constraints and the long-range potential fluctuations (LRPF) arising from the defects and heterogeneities in the disordered semiconductors are important for understanding the atomic and electronic properties of amorphous semiconductors. Here, they are applied to the already commercialized Ge$_{X}$Sb$_{Y}$ Te$_{1−X−Y}$ (GST) chalcogenide glasses used in the rewritable phase change memory (PCM) devices. The main concern at present is to improve their ability to withstand a large number of phase change cycles, by choosing the right composition. The two considerations (BCT and LRPF) are briefly described and tested on the most commonly used Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$ and the nearby compositions. While these considerations provide significant insight into their atomic and electronic structures, the ansatz linking them with the durability of the PCM devices need to be justified by more work.</p>
