				<title>Cobalt(III), nickel(II) and ruthenium(II) complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline family of ligands: DNA binding and photocleavage studies</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>DNA binding and photocleavage characteristics of a series of mixedligand complexes of the type [M(phen)2LL]$^{n+}$ (where M = Co(III), Ni(II) or Ru(II), LL = 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), phenanthroline-dione (phen-dione) or dipyridophenazine (dppz) and  $n = 3$ or 2) have been investigated in detail. Various physico-chemical and biochemical techniques including UV/Visible, fluorescence and viscometric titration, thermal denaturation, and differential pulse voltammetry have been employed to probe the details of DNA binding by these complexes; intrinsic binding constants (Kb) have been estimated under a similar set of experimental conditions. Analysis of the results suggests that intercalative ability of the coordinated ligands varies as dppz $&gt;$ phen $&lt;$ phen-dione in this series of complexes. While the Co(II) and Ru(II) complexes investigated in this study effect photocleavage of the supercoiled pBR 322 DNA, the corresponding Ni(II) complexes are found to be inactive under similar experimental conditions. Results of detailed investigations carried out inquiring into the mechanistic aspects of DNA photocleavage by [Co(phen)2 (dppz)]$^{3+}$ have also been reported. </p>

				<title>Improved technology for manufacture of carbon electrodes</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0019-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Current industrial carbon electrodes are typically manufactured by blending petroleum coke particles (the filler) with molten coal tar pitch (the binder) and extruding the resultant mix to form the `green electrode’. This is then baked under controlled conditions. In case of usage as anodes in steel electric furnaces (or as other carbon and graphite products), the electrodes could undergo further processing like pitch impregnation or graphitization. During heat treatment, some of the organics are destructively distilled, vaporized or decomposed, resulting in carbon deposition in the electrode. As the vaporized materials exit the body of the electrode they cause porosity in the walls, which results in reduction in density, current carrying capacity and flexural strength.</p>
					<p>The paper presents investigations to improve some physico-chemical characteristics of these electrodes (such as coefficient of thermal expansion, mechanical strengths, density, pore volume, porosity etc.), obtained in different manufacture steps, by addition of varieties of coal tar pitch. These include attempts to improve the chemical compatibility of the coke-pitch system in the mixture and establish the method and the point of introduction of additive, the concentration required and appropriate analytical control during the entire manufacture. Methods of analysis used include thermogravimetry and porosimetry. The microstructure of the electrodes is investigated through a wide range and the data obtained include pore size and pore volume distribution, surface area, porosity, particle size distribution and type of pores. The overall results clearly indicate better characteristics and performance for electrodes with additives as against electrodes without them, such as lower porosity, lower thermal expansion coefficients and greater mechanical strength. These data are analyzed with respect to the process step and electrode type.</p>

				<title>Characteristic polynomials of linear polyacenes and their subspectrality</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0027-0033</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coefficients of characteristic polynomials (CP) of linear polyacenes (LP) have been shown to be obtainable from Pascal’s triangle by using a graph factorisation and squaring technique. Strong subspectrality existing among the members of the linear polyacene series has been shown from the derivation of the CP’s. Thus it has been shown that the entire eigenspectrum of an $n$-ring LP is included in that of $(2n + 1)$-ring LP. Correspondence between the eigenspectra of linear chains and LP’s is brought out by a recently developed vertex-alternation and squaring algorithm.</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0035-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theory was applied to the calculation of molecular structures of N-methyl formamide (NMF), N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), and N,Ndimethyl acetamide (DMA). DFT calculations on NMF, DMF, and DMA were performed  using a combination of the local functional of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN) with the  nonlocal exchange functional of Becke and the nonlocal correlational functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr (BLYP). The adiabatic connection method (ACM) of Becke has also been used, for the first time, for the calculation of molecular structures of NMF, DMF, and DMA. The calculated molecular structures are in excellent agreement with the experimental geometries of NMF and DMA derived from gas-phase electron-diffraction studies. Sparse experimental data on the gas-phase geometry of DMF reported in the literature compares well with the DFT results on DMF. DFT emerges as a powerful method to calculate molecular structures.</p>

					<p>The interaction of 10-(3’-N-morpholinopropyl)phenoxazine [MPP], 10-(4’-N-morpholinobutyl)phenoxazine [MBP], 10-(3’-N-morpholinopropyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine [MPCP], 10-(3’-N-piperidinopropyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine [PPCP] or 10-(3’-N-morpholinopropyl)-2-trifluoromethylphenoxazine [MPTP] with bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been studied by gel filtration and equilibrium dialysis methods. The binding of these modulators, based on dialysis experiments, has been characterized using the following parameters: percentage of bound drug ($\beta$), the association constant ($K_1$), the apparent binding constant ($k$) and the free energy change ($\Delta F^\circ$). The binding of phenoxazine derivatives to serum transporter protein, BSA, is correlated with their octanol-water partition coefficient, $\log_{10}~ P$. In addition, effect of the displacing activities of hydroxyzine and acetylsalicylic acid on the binding of phenoxazine derivatives to albumin has been studied. Results of the displacement experiments show that phenoxazine benzene rings and tertiary amines attached to the side chain of the phenoxazine moiety are bound to a hydrophobic area on the albumin molecule.</p>

				<title>Pulsed laser excitation of phosphate stabilised silver nanoparticles</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0063-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser flash photolysis studies were carried out on two types of silver nanoparticles prepared by  $\gamma$-radiolysis of $Ag^+$ solutions in the presence of polyphosphate as the stabiliser. Type I silver nanoparticles displayed a surface plasmon band at 390 nm. Type II silver nanoparticles showed a 390 nm surface plasmon band with a shoulder at 550 nm. On photoexcitation in the surface plasmon band region, using 35 picosecond laser pulses at 355 nm and 532 nm, the type II solutions showed transient bleaching and absorption signals in the 450–900 nm region, which did not decay appreciably up to 5 nanoseconds. These transient changes were found to get annealed in the interval  $t$ where $5 \text{ ns } &lt; t &lt; 100$ ns. Extended photolysis of the nanoparticle solutions with repetitive laser pulses resulted in a decrease in the values of the average particle size which were measured by employing the dynamic light scattering technique.</p>

				<page>0073-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of formic and oxalic acids by quinolinium fluorochromate (QFC) have been studied in dimethylsulphoxide. The main product of oxidation is carbon dioxide. The reaction is first-order with respect to QFC. Michaelis–Menten type of kinetics were observed with respect to the reductants. The reaction is acid-catalysed and the acid dependence has the form: $k_{\text obs} = a + b[H^+]$. The oxidation of $\alpha$-deuterioformic acid exhibits a substantial primary kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 6⋅01$ at 303 K). The reaction has been studied in nineteen different organic solvents and the solvent effect has been analysed using Taft’s and Swain’s multiparametric equations. The temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect indicates the presence of a symmetrical cyclic transition state in the rate-determining step. Suitable mechanisms have been proposed</p>

				<page>0083-0095</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The design and fabrication of a Smalley-type cluster source in combination with a reflectron based time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer are reported. The generation of clusters is based on supersonic jet expansion of the sampling plume. Sample cells for both liquid and solid targets developed for this purpose are described. Two pulsed Nd-YAG lasers are used in tandem, one (532 nm) for target vapourization and the other (355 nm) for cluster ionization. Methanol clusters of nuclearity up to 14 (mass 500 amu) were produced from liquid methanol as the test sample. The clusters were detected with a mass resolution of ~ 2500 in the R-TOF geometry. Carbon clusters up to a nuclearity of 28 were obtained using a polyimide target. The utility of the instrument is demonstrated by carrying out experiments to generate mixed clusters from alcohol mixtures.</p>

					<p>The semiempirical AM1 SCF-MO method is used to study the benzyne mechanism for aromatic nucleophilic substitution of various  $m$-substituted chlorobenzenes and 3-chloropyridine. The calculations predict that most of the fixed substituents studied here would induce the formation of 2,3-arynes through their electron-withdrawing resonance or inductive effects. The geometry and electronic structure of the 2,3- and 3,4-arynes investigated here, confirm the generally accepted $o$-benzyne structure postulated for arynes. The sites of nucleophilic addition to arynes as predicted here are in fair agreement with expectation and experimental findings.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of cadmium sulphide in pure and mixed Langmuir–Blodgett films of $n$-octadecylsuccinic acid</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0109-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanoparticles were grown by the reaction of sodium sulphide (Na$_2$S) with Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of cadmium salts of $n$-octadecylsuccinic acid (ODSU) and with LB films of ODSU in mixtures of octadecylamine and octadecyl alcohol. The results indicate that heterogeneous nucleation and aggregation in the pure ODSU LB films due to processes like Ostwald ripening are destabilized by the presence of the long-chain amine and alcohol in mixed systems. CdS nanoparticles in the LB films were monitored by UV-visible absorption spectra, which allow an estimation of the size of the particles. The morphology, size and nature of the nanocrystallites formed depend on whether the sulphidation was done on the pure film or in the mixed films. It is seen that particles of size around 1⋅6 nm were formed in ODSU/octadecylalcohol and ODSU/octadecylamine mixed LB films while in pure ODSU films the size was about 2⋅7 nm. These films showed typical needle-shaped structures, as observed by the optical microscopic technique. Mean size and morphology were confirmed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, while selective area electron diffraction patterns showed six-fold symmetry and indicated that the CdS crystals grow epitaxially with respect to the monolayer. Further, the crystallisation enhanced in the mixed LB films showed a characteristic zinc oxide (Wurtzite) structure compared with the pure ODSU matrix. </p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The influence of 3-methyl-2,6-diphenyl piperidin-4-one (MDPO) and 2-phenyl decahydroquinoline-4-one (PDQO) synthesised in the laboratory on hydrogen permeation and corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 1N H$_2$SO$_4$ has been studied using weight loss and various electrochemical AC and DC corrosion-monitoring techniques. Both the compounds inhibit the corrosion of mild steel in H$_2$SO$_4$ Potentiodynamic polarisation studies clearly reveal that they behave predominantly as cathodic inhibitors. The extent of decrease in hydrogen permeation current through steel surfaces has been studied by the hydrogen electropermeation technique. Double layer capacitance ($C_{dl}$) and charge transfer resistance ($R_t$) values are derived from Nyquist plots obtained from AC impedance studies. The adsorption of these compounds on mild steel surfaces from H$_2$SO$_4$ obeys Temkin’s adsorption isotherm.</p>

The potential of Sz related to the Wiener index (W) is critically discussed. In addition, Huckel molecular orbital energies: $E_{\text HOMO}$, $E_{\text LUMO}$ and $E_{\text total}$ were also used for comparing and modelling antitubercular activities of the quinolones.

				<abstract>
					<p>In a reaction sequence of amide addition followed by halogen oxidation the triazasulphite S(NR)$^{2 −}_3$ and the tetrazasulphate S(NR)$^{2 −}_4$ are readily accessible from sulphur diimide S(NR)$_2$ via sulphur triimide S(NR)$_3$. Addition of lithium organics to sulphur triimide provides a general route to triazasulphonates RS(NR)$^{2−}_3$. All these anions resemble potential tripodal coordination behaviour because of their nitrogen donor centres. Furthermore, the sulphur polyimido ligands are capable of responding to the various requirements of different metals (even in mixed metal species) by charge (de)localization. This paper deals with the synthetic routes of the sulphur nitrogen anions and their coordination behaviour. Their reactivity, mainly towards main group metal synthons, is also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Platinum group metal chalcogenides find extensive applications in catalysis and in the electronic industry. To develop an efficient low temperature clean preparation of these materials, molecular routes have been explored. Thus the chemistry of mononuclear organochalcogenolates of the type [M(ER $1/4$)$_2$(PR$_3$)$_2$], binuclear benzylselenolates, [M$_2$Cl$_2$($\sim$-SeBz)$_2$(PR$_3$)$_2$], allylpalladium complexes [Pd$_2$($\sim$-ER)$_2$($y^3-C$_4$H$_7$)$_2$] and palladium/platinum sulphido/selenido-bridged  complexes, [M$_2$($\sim$-E)$_2$L$_4$] (M = Pd or Pt; E = S, Se or Te; L = tertiary phosphine ligand) has been investigated. All the complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, NMR ({}^1 H, {}^{31}P, {}^{77}Se, {}^{195}Pt) spectroscopy and in some cases by X-ray diffraction. The thermal behaviour of these complexes has been studied by TGA. The pyrolysis of allylpalladium complexes in refluxing xylene yields Pd$_4$E as established by analysis and XRD patterns.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>\textit{De novo} design of artificial proteins is an essential approach to elucidate the principles of protein architecture and to understand specific functions of natural proteins and also to yield novel molecules for medical and industrial aims. We have designed artificial sequences of 153 amino acids to fit the main-chain framework of the sperm whale myoglobin structure based on the knowledge-based energy functions  to evaluate the compatibility between protein tertiary structures and amino acid sequences. The synthesized artificial globins bind a single heme per protein molecule  as designed, which show well-defined electrochemical and spectroscopic features characteristic of proteins with a low-spin heme. Redox and ligand binding reactions of the artificial heme proteins were investigated and these heme-related functions were found to vary with their structural uniqueness. Relationships between the structural and functional properties are discussed.</p>

				<title>Models for the active site in galactose oxidase: Structure, spectra and redox of copper(II) complexes of certain phenolate ligands</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0223-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Galactose oxidase (GOase) is a fungal enzyme which is unusual among metalloenzymes in appearing to catalyse the two electron oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes and H$_2$O$_2$. The crystal structure of the enzyme reveals that the coordination geometry of mononuclear copper(II) ion is square pyramidal, with two histidine imidazoles, a tyrosinate, and either H$_2$O ($p$H 7 0) or acetate (from buffer, $p$H 4 5) in the equatorial sites and a tyrosinate ligand weakly bound in the axial position. This paper summarizes the results of our studies on the structure, spectral and redox properties of certain novel models for the active site of the inactive form of GOase. The monophenolato Cu(II) complexes of the type [Cu(L1)X][H(L1) = 2-(\textit{bis}(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)aminomethyl)-4-nitrophenol and X$^-$= Cl$^-${\bf 1}, NCS$^-${\bf 2}, CH$_3$COO$^-${\bf 3}, ClO$_4^-${\bf 4}] reveal a distorted square pyramidal geometry around Cu(II) with an unusual axial coordination of phenolate moiety. The coordination geometry of {\bf 3} is reminiscent of the active site of GOase with an axial phenolate and equatorial CH$_3$COO$^-$ ligands. All the present complexes exhibit several electronic and EPR spectral features which are also similar to the enzyme. Further, to establish the structural and spectroscopic consequences of the coordination of two tyrosinates in GOase enzyme, we studied the monomeric copper(II) complexes containing two phenolates and imidazole/pyridine donors as closer structural models for GOase. N,Ndimethylethylenediamine and N,N -dimethylethylenediamine have been used as starting materials to obtain a variety of 2,4-disubstituted phenolate ligands. The X-ray crystal structures of the complexes [Cu(L5)(py)], ({\bf 8}) [H$_2$ (L5) = N,N-dimethyl-N ,N -\textit{bis}(2-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzyl) ethylenediamine, py = pyridine] and [Cu(L8)(H$_2$O)] ({\bf 11}), [H$_2$(L8) = N,N -dimethyl-N,N -\textit{bis}(2-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzyl)ethylenediamine] reveal distorted square pyramidal geometries around Cu(II) with the axial tertiary amine nitrogen and water coordination respectively. Interestingly, for the latter complex there are two different molecules present in the same unit cell containing the methyl groups of the ethylenediamine fragment cis to each other in one molecule and trans to each other in the other. The ligand field and EPR spectra of the model complexes reveal square-based geometries even in solution. The electrochemical and chemical means of generating novel radical species of the model complexes, analogous to the active form of the enzyme is presently under investigation.</p>

					<p>Recent developments in the area of hybrid structures are overviewed with special emphasis on iron phosphate–oxalate materials. The structure of the iron phosphate–oxalates consists of iron phosphate chains or layers that are connected by oxalate moieties completing the architecture. The compounds exhibit interesting magnetic properties originating from the super-exchange interactions that are predominantly anti-ferromagnetic, involving the iron phosphates and the oxalate moieties. One of the materials, {\bf IV}, also exhibits interesting adsorptive properties reminiscent of aluminosilicate zeolites. The aluminum phosphate–oxalate,  {\bf VII},  indicates that hybrid structures can be formed with zeolite architecture.</p>

				<page>0273-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes the recent results obtained in our laboratory on the interaction of polyfunctional ligands with divalent alkaline earth metal ions and a few  divalent transition metal ions. Treatment of MCl$_2$ $n$H$_2$O (M = Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba)with 2-amino benzoic acid leads to the formation of complexes [Mg(2-aba)$_2$] ({\bf 1}), [Ca(2-aba)$_2$(OH$_2$)$_3$] ({\bf 2}), [{Sr(2-aba)$_2$(OH$_2$)$_2$}$_2$ H$_2$O)] ({\bf 3}), [Ba(2-aba)$_2$(OH$_2$)] ({\bf 4}), respectively. While the calcium ions in {\bf 2} are hepta-coordinated, the strontium and barium ions in {\bf 3} and {\bf 4} reveal a coordination number of nine apart from additional metal–metal interactions. Apart from the carboxylate functionality, the amino group also binds to the metal centres in the case of strontium and barium complexes {\bf 3} and {\bf 4}. Complexes [{Mg(H$_2$O)_$6$}(4-aba)$_2$ 2H$_2$O] ({\bf 5}), [Ca(4-aba)$_2$(H_$2$O)$_2$] ({\bf 6}) prepared from 4-aminobenzoic acid reveal more open or layered structures. Interaction of 2-mercaptobenzoic acid with $MCl$_2$\cdot6H$_2$O (M = Mg, Ca), however, leads to the.oxidation of the thiol group resulting in the disulphide 2,2 -dithio\textit{bis}(benzoic acid). New metal–organic framework based hydrogen-bonded porous solids [{M(btec)(OH$_2$)4}$_n$ $n$(C$_4$H$_{12}$N$_2) 4$n$H_$2$O] (btec = 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylate) (M = Co {\bf 9}; Ni {\bf 10}; Zn \textbf{11}) have been synthesized from 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylic acid in the presence of piperazine. These compounds are made up of extensively hydrogenbonded alternating layers of anionic M-btec co-ordination polymer and piperazinium cations. Compounds \textbf{2–11} described herein form polymeric networks in the solid–state with the aid of different coordinating capabilities of the carboxylate anions hydrogen bonding interactions.</p>

				<title>Macrocyclic effects upon isomeric Cu$^{II}M$^{II}$ and M$^{II}$Cu$^{II}$ cores. Formation with unsymmetric phenol-based macrocyclic ligands</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0291-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper discusses coordination-position isomeric M$^{II}$Cu$^{II}$ and Cu$^{II}$M$^{II}$ complexes, using unsymmetric dinucleating macrocycles (L$^{m;n}$)$^{2-}$ ((L$^{2;2}$)$^{2-$}$, (L$^{2;3}$)$^{2–}$ and (L$^{2;4}$)$^{2–}$ that comprise two 2-(N-methyl)-aminomethyl-6-iminomethyl-4-bromophenonate entities, combined through the ethylene chain ($m = 2$) between the two amine nitrogens and through the ethylene, trimethylene or tetramethylene chain ($n = 2$, 3 or 4) between the two imine nitrogens. The macrocycles have dissimilar N(amine)$_2$O$_2$  and N(imine)$_2$O$_2$ metal-binding sites sharing the phenolic oxygens. The reaction of the mononuclear Cu$^{II}$ precursors, [Cu(L$^{2;2}$)], [Cu(L$^{2;2}$)] and [Cu(L$^{2;2}$)], with a M$^{II}$ perchlorate and a M$^{II}$ acetate salt formed (acetato)M$^{II}$ Cu$^{II}$ complexes:[CoCu(L$^{2;2}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 0 5H$_2$O] ({\bf 1}), [NiCu(L$^{2;2}$) (AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 2}), [ZnCu(L$^{2;2}$((AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 3}), [CoCu(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 0 5H$_2$O ({\bf 4}), [NiCu(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 5}), [ZnCu(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 0 5H$_2$O ({\bf 6}), [CoCu(L$^{2;4}$)(AcO)(DMF)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 7}), [NiCu(L$^{2;4}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 2DMF ({\bf 8}) and [ZnCu(L$^{2;4}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 9}) (the formulation [M$_a$M$_b$ (L$^{m;n}$)]$^{2+}$ means that M$_a$ resides in the aminic site and M$_b$ in the iminic site). The site selectivity of the metal ions is demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic studies for {\bf 2} MeOH, {\bf 3}, {\bf 5}, {\bf 7}, and {\bf 9}. An (acetato)Cu$^{II}$Zn$^{II}$ complex, [CuZn(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$^4$ ({\bf 10}), was obtained by the reaction of [PbCu(L$^{2;3}$)]-(ClO$_4$)$_2$ with ZnSO$_4$ 4H$_2$O, in the presence of sodium acetate. Other complexes of the Cu$^{II}$M$^{II}$ type were thermodynamically unstable to cause a scrambling of metal ions. The Cu migration from the iminic site to the aminic site in the synthesis of {\bf 10} is explained by the `kinetic macrocyclic effect’. The coordination-position isomers, {\bf 6} and {\bf 10}, are differentiated by physicochemical properties.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0311-0322</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have developed a new method for measuring in-situ the growth of the nanometre-size silica particles which lead to the formation of sol–gel glasses. This technique is based on the decay of fluorescence polarisation anisotropy due to Brownian rotation of dye molecules bound to the particles. Results to date give near ångstrom resolution and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach both for providing industrial quality control and helping fundamental research. Our approach has several key advantages over traditional techniques for nanometre metrology, such as small angle X-ray and neutron scattering and electron microscopy. In this paper we present silica particle growth dynamics in a hydrogel as detected by two near-infrared dyes, the effect of adding D$_2$O on the hydrodynamic radius and the effect of salt addition.</p>

				<title>Stereochemical trends of metal derivatives of some heterocyclic-2-thiones and thiosemicarbazones</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0323-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of heterocyclic thiones/thiosemicarbazones with metals has been the subject of several investigations as these ligands contain chemically active groups, –N(H)–C(=S)– –N=C(–SH)– ,and are useful model compounds for sulphur-containing analogues of purine and pyrimidine bases. Heterocylic-2-thiones  bind to metals in several ways and lead to the formation of monomeric or polymeric complexes. For example, the simplest prototype of heterocylic-2-thiones, namely, pyridine-2-thione has several ways of binding, notably, terminal S-bonding and S-bridging (in neutral form), while in anionic form the modes are terminal S-bonding, S-bridging, N,S-chelation, N,S-bridging, N,S-chelation-cum-S-bridging and N,S-bridging-cum-S-bridging. Similarly, thiosemicarbazones bind to metals as S-bonded unidentates or N,S-chelates. In this paper, the chemistry of pyridine-2-thione, its N-oxide, 2-(benzylthio)pyridine-1-oxide thione with metals like iron(II), ruthenium(II), nickel(II), palladium(II), platinum(II), copper(I), copper(II), silver(I) and mercury(II) is briefly described. As regards thiosemicarbazones, focus is only on two compounds, namely organomercury(II) and organothallium(III). A variety of new molecules, well characterised by NMR and X-ray crystallography, is introduced.</p>

				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0439-0448</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Isomorphously substituted molecular sieves, MAPO-31, NAPO-31 and ZAPO-31, were prepared under mild hydrothermal conditions from gels containing sources of aluminium, phosphorus, appropriate metal and dipropylamine (DPA), presumably acting as a structure-directing template. They were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TGA, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), ESR, Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) and diffusion reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) techniques. In the XRD, the peak at 2 = 16 7° of the metal substituted AlPO-31 is more intense than that of pure AlPO-31 suggesting preferential occupation of the plane corresponding to it as compared to other planes. The O-H stretch in the IR spectra of the metal-substituted molecular sieves is blue-shifted with respect to the parent AlPO-31 molecular sieves possibly due to metal substitution. The g values obtained from the ESR spectra of MAPO-31 and NAPO-31 also substantiate framework substitution. Ethylation of toluene was carried out between 300 and 450°C over the above catalysts as a model test reaction. The high toluene conversion over metal-substituted  molecular sieves proves the isomorphic substitution of metal ions in the AlPO-31 framework.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This article illustrates the application of a 2$&#37;$ ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate–cross-linked polystyrene support (EGDMA–PS) in manual solid phase peptide synthesis. This copolymer has been characterised and optimised for peptide synthesis by performing the synthesis of a few model peptides and two biologically important peptides. EGDMA–cross-linked polystyrene support was prepared by the suspension polymerisation of the monomers EGDMA and styrene. EGDMA–PS resin undergoes facile swelling in a variety of solvents, both polar and nonpolar, used in peptide synthesis. The polymer was functionalised by Friedel–Crafts chloromethylation reaction. Peptides were assembled on a 2$&#37;$ cross-linked chloromethyl polymer support of capacity 1 63 mmol Cl/g. The biological peptides synthesised are an 11-residue peptide ATP binding site of the CDC2 kinase and a difficult sequence-a nineresidue peptide  34-42 corresponding to a portion of the hydrophobic terminus of the-amyloid protein  1-42. After synthesis, the peptides were cleaved from the support by treating with neat TFA. Purity of the peptides obtained in good yield was checked by TLC and HPLC methods and found to be fairly high.</p>

					<p>The changes in the electronic absorption spectra of ferrocene in the halocarbon solvents chloroform and carbontetrachloride have been investigated under photoexcitation in nitrogen atmosphere. Photoexcitations have been made with monochromatic light (using an Xe-source and a monochromator), at intervals of a few nanometers in the spectral range 220–750 nm. Analysing the spectra  by a modified method the position of the charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) band has been located for both the solvents. The position of the CTTS band in the case of carbontetrachloride solution located (320 nm) by the present study is different from the previously reported value (307 nm), while from the previous studies the position of the CTTS band in the case of the spectra of ferrocene in chloroform was not clear. From the present investigation, the changes in spectra after photoexcitation studied as a function, the concentration of ferrocene in the solution and the time (duration) of photoexcitations, have been observed to be systematic. Using the position of the new band (320 nm) for the CTTS transition in the case of carbontetrachloride, ionization potential of ferrocene has been estimated and the estimated value has shown excellent agreement with the experimental value indicating the exactness of the newly located CTTS band position.</p>

				<page>0487-0496</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pulse radiolysis technique has been employed to investigate the reaction of DNA-minor-groove ligand  \textit{bis}benzimidazole Hoechst 33258 with pyrimidine and purine nucleotide-derived radicals. Formation of an N-centred Hoechst-33258 radical is observed. Bimolecular rate constants and the yields of Hoechst-33258 radical have been evaluated. While the rate constant for the reaction of pyrimidine-derived radicals with Hoechst-33258 remained the same (1–2) $\times$ $10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, the yields of the Hoechst-33258 radical varied from 25$&#37;$ (5 -cytidine monophosphate) to 75$&#37;$ (5 -guanosine monophosphate) under anoxic conditions. The rate constant values for the reaction of purine-derived radicals with Hoechst-33258, under oxic and anoxic conditions, remained the same whereas with pyrimidine-derived radicals, the rate constant value under oxic conditions was about two orders of magnitude lower than under anoxic conditions. The difference in the yields of Hoechst-33258 radical with various nucleotide-derived radicals suggest the formation of different types of radicals and that the reaction mainly occurs by electron transfer from Hoechst-33258 to the nucleotide radicals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of induced decomposition of potassium peroxomonosulphate (PMS) by the phase transfer catalysts (PTC), viz. tetrabutylammonium chloride [TBAC] and tetrabutylphosphonium chloride [TBPC] have been investigated. The effect of [PMS], [PTC], ionic strength of the medium and temperature on the rate of decomposition of PMS was studied. The rate of decomposition of PMS was monitored under pseudo-first-order condition at a constant temperature (50 $\pm$ 0 1$^\circ$C). The rate of decomposition was first order with respect to PMS for TBAC and half order for TBPC. The order with respect of PTC was found to be unity for TBAC and half order for TBPC. A suitable kinetic scheme has been proposed to account for the experimental data and its significance is discussed.</p>

					<p>The kinetics of the oxidation of nickel (II) hexaaza and nickel (II) pentaaza macrocycles by the peroxydisulphate anion, S$_2$O$_8^{2-}$, were studied in aqueous media. Effect of $p$H on reaction rate was also studied. The rate increases with increase of S$_2$O$_8^{2-}$ concentration. Rates are almost independent of acid between  $p$H 4 and 2, giving overall a relatively simple second-order rate law followed by oxidation within the ion pair solvent shell. Using rate = +1/2 d[Ni(L)$^{3+}$]/dt = k[Ni(L)$^{2+}$][S_2O$_8^{2-}$], oxidation rate constants were determined.</p>

					<p>2-(Arylazo)pyrimidines (aapm) are N,N -chelating ligands and synthesise orange-red complexes of composition [Pd(aapm)Cl$_2$],  {\bf 1}, with Pd(MeCN)$_2$Cl$_2$ in MeCN. The complex has  \textit{cis}-PdCl$_2$ configuration [(Pd−Cl): 340, 360 cm$^{-1}$]. The treatment of Tollen’s reagent (`AgOH’) leads to chelatative hydroxylation in the pendant aryl ring, affording a green phenolato complex, Pd(aapmO)Cl, {\bf 5} (aapmO is deprotonated 2-((8-hydroxo)arylazo)pyrimidine). The reaction is also carried out by controlled addition of dilute sodium hydroxide in air or by the addition of PhIO/$m$-chloroperbenzoic acid to a MeCN suspension of the complex. A single Pd–Cl stretch at 360 cm$^{-1}$ supports the composition of phenolato complex. Unlike Pd(aapm)Cl$_2$ the hydroxylated product, Pd(aapmO)Cl, has a structured intense absorption in the visible region near 670 nm. The Pd–Cl bond in Pd(aapmO)Cl is highly sensitive to nucleophilic substitution and slowly hydrolyses in aqueous medium.</p>

The hydrothermal treatments result in the activation of the perovskite oxides by increasing their surface area very markedly.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A search for non-cyanide plating baths for copper resulted in the development of alkaline copper complex baths containing trisodium citrate [TSC] and triethanolamine [TEA]. Voltammetric studies were carried out on platinum to understand the electrochemical behaviour of these complexes. In TSC solutions, the deposition of copper involves the slow formation of a monovalent species. Adsorption of this species obeys Langmuir isotherm. In TEA solutions the deposition involves the formation of monovalent ions obeying the non-activated Temkin isotherm. Conversion of divalent to monovalent copper is also slow. In TEA and TSC alkaline copper solutions, the predominant species that undergo stepwise reduction contain only TEA ligands</p>

				<title>Oxidation of caffeine by phosphate radical anion in aqueous solution under anoxic conditions</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0551-0557</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The photooxidation of caffeine in presence of peroxydiphosphate (PDP) in aqueous solution at natural $p$H ($\sim$7 5) has been carried out in a quantum yield reactor using a high-pressure mercury lamp. The reactions  were followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of caffeine at {}_${\max}$ (272 nm). The rates of reaction were calculated under different experimental conditions. The quantum yields were calculated from the rates of oxidation of caffeine and the intensity of light at 254 nm which was measured by using peroxydisulphate solution as a standard chemical actinometer. The reaction rates of oxidation of caffeine by PDP increase with increase in [PDP] as well as with increase in light intensity, while they are independent of [caffeine]. The quantum yields of oxidation of caffeine by PDP are independent of [PDP] as well as light intensity. However, quantum yields of oxidation of caffeine by PDP increase with increase in caffeine concentration. On the basis of these experimental results and product analysis, a probable mechanism has been suggested in which PDP is activated to phosphate radical anions (PO$_4^{.2-}$) by direct photolysis of PDP and also by the sensitizing effect of caffeine. The phosphate radical anions thus produced react with caffeine by electron transfer reaction, resulting in the formation of caffeine radical cation, which deprotonates in a fast step to produce C8OH adduct radicals. These radicals might react with PDP to give final product 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid and PO$_4^{.2-}$ radicals, the latter propagates the chain reaction.</p>

					<p>The reactions were sensitive between seven rare earth (RE) metals Nd(III), La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), Sm(III), Eu(III) and Gd(III) and dibromo-$p$-methylmethylsulfonazo (DBMMSA) in acidic solution. The spectral correction method has been applied in the determination of properties of RE complexes instead of ordinary spectrophotometry. Composition ratios, real molar absorptivities ( ) and stepwise stability constants ($K$) of each of the RE complexes were determined easily because the method eliminated the absorption influence of excess of ligand on complex. Results showed that the cumulative  $K$ values of the complexes were between 3 91 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ and 2 34 $\times$ 10$^{28}$ and the real (not apparent) absorptivity between 8 85 $\times$ 10$^4$ and 2 12 $\times$ 10$^5$ l mol$^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 640 nm.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and equilibria of the axial ligation of alkyl(aquo)cobaloximes by imidazole and cyanide have been measured spectrophotometrically in aqueous solutions of ionic strength 1⋅0 M at 25$\circ$C as a function of $p$H. Comparison of $K_{\text{IMD}}$ and $K_{\text{CN}}$– of CH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$ and BrCH$_2$ cobaloximes indicates that their stability is in the order BrCH$_2$ $&gt;$ CH$_3$ $&gt;$ C$_2$H$_5$. As the electron-withdrawing capacity of the alkyl group \textit{trans} to water increases, the electron density of the cobalt(III) decreases and thus it becomes a stronger Lewis acid and binds more strongly to imidazole and cyanide. The association and dissociation rate constants are better correlated to the relative softness of the ligand showing that cyanide binds 30 times faster than imidazole. These complexes are isolated and are characterized by IR and ${}^1$H NMR spectra.</p>

				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0001-0009</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metalloderivatives of anionic tetrasulphonated tetraphenylporphyrin (MTPPS, M = Mn(III), Fe(III) and Co(III)) were synthesized and immobilized on cationically functionalised divinylbenzene(DVB)–crosslinked polystyrene(PS). These supported catalysts (PS-MTPPS) were found to exhibit peroxidase-like activity. The co-oxidation of 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol by H$_2$O$_2$ was attempted with these catalysts to mimic this enzyme function. The catalytic efficiency of all these immobilized MTPPS was found to be superior to the corresponding unsupported MTPPS in solution. The effect of the central metal ion of the porphyrin, $p$H of the reaction medium and also the temperature effect are investigated. The ideal  $p$H was seen to be in the 8 0–8 5 range, with maximum effect at 8 2. The efficiency order for the various PS-MTPPS was seen to be Co$&gt;$Mn$&gt;$Fe, with CoTPPS showing efficiency comparable to that of horseradish peroxidase. The catalytic efficiency was found to be increasing with temperature for all the catalysts. The re-usability of these PS-MTPPS systems for peroxidase-like activity was also studied and it was found that they exhibited a very high degree of recyclability without much poisoning.</p>

					<p>Synthesis, spectral and solution studies on 2-ethyl imidazolate-bridged (2-EtIm) homo-binuclear copper(II)–copper(II) and hetero-binuclear copper(II)–zinc(II) homologue are described. Magnetic moment values of homo-binuclear complexes indicate that the imidazolate group can mediate antiferromagnetic interactions. Optical spectra of hetero-binuclear complex at varying $p$H values suggest that the imidazolate-bridged complex is stable over the $p$H-range 7 15–10 0.</p>

				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0035-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc finger domains consist of sequences of amino acids containing cysteine and histidine residues tetrahedrally coordinated to a zinc ion. The role of zinc in a DNA binding finger was considered purely structural due to the absence of redox chemistry in zinc. However, whether other metals e.g. Co(II) or Cd(II) can substitute Zn(II) is not settled. For an answer the detailed interaction of Co(II) and Cd(II) with cysteine methylester and histidine methylester has been investigated as a model for the zinc  core in zinc fingers. The study was extended to different temperatures to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters associated with these interactions. The results suggest that zinc has a unique role.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of oxidation of five vicinal and four non-vicinal diols, and two of their monoethers by benzyltrimethylammonium tribromide (BTMAB) have been studied in 3:7 ($v/v$) acetic acid–water mixture. The vicinal diols yield the carbonyl compounds arising out of the glycol bond fission while the other diols give the hydroxycarbonyl compounds. The reaction is first-order with respect to BTMAB. Michaelis–Menten type kinetics is observed with respect to diol. Addition of benzyltrimethylammonium chloride does not affect the rate. Tribromide ion is postulated to be the reactive oxidizing species. Oxidation of [1,1,2,2-$^2$H$_4$] ethanediol shows the absence of a kinetic isotope effect. The reaction exhibits substantial solvent isotope effect. A mechanism involving a glycol-bond fission has been proposed for the oxidation of the vicinal diols. The other diols are oxidized by a hydride ion transfer to the oxidant, as are the monohydric alcohols.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements of D$_2$O solutions (0 1 M) of sodium cholate (NaC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) were carried out at $T$ = 298 K. Under compositions very much above the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the bile salt micelle size growths were monitored by adopting Hayter–Penfold type analysis of the scattering data. NaC and NaDC solutions show presence of correlation peaks at $Q$ = 0 12 and 0 1 Å$^{-1}$ respectively. Monodisperse ellipsoids of the micelles produce best fits. For NaC and NaDC systems, aggregation number (9 0, 16 0), fraction of the free counterions per micelle (0 79, 0 62), semi-minor (8 0 Å) and semi-major axes (18 4, 31 7 Å) values for the micelles were deduced. Extent of micellar growth was studied using ESR correlation time measurements on a suitable probe incorporating NaC and NaDC micelles. The growth parameter (axial ratio) values were found to be 2 3 and 4 0 for NaC and NaDC systems respectively. The values agree with those of SANS.</p>

					<p>Cupronickels offer enhanced corrosion protection in marine environments by the formation of passive films on the surface. Cyclic voltammetric studies were carried on cupronickels in chloride solutions at  $p$H 6 3 to understand the role of chloride ions in passive film formation. Increase in nickel content of the alloy and of chloride ions in solution decreases film resistance. Chloride ions take part in reduction of the passive film to copper.

				<page>0119-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spreading behaviour of the dimeric surfactant polyethyleneglycoldistearate (PEGDS) monolayer at air/water interface has been studied using surface pressure–area ( –$A$) isotherms as a function of temperature. The isotherms show a plateau suggesting a transition between a liquid expanded (LE) and a condensed state. The condensed state possibly arises due to nucleation and growth of multilayers from the monolayer. Isobaric measurements of both  $A–T$ and  $–T$ at constant area show transitions at $T = 295$ K. These plots suggest a melting followed by formation of condensed microcrystallites. Structure optimization carried out using various angles of orientation of the alkyl tails with respect to the backbone in PEGDS reveals tilt transitions of the tails in different states which can be related to the packing behaviour seen in the isotherms. Optical microscopy has been used to confirm the structures in these states.</p>

					<p>Multiphoton dissociation/ionization has been studied for CH$_3$SCH$_3$ at 355 and 532 nm using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The major ion signals observed at 355 nm are C$^+$, CH$_3^+$, HCS$^+$, CH$_2$S$^+$, CH$_3$S$^+^ and CH$_3$SCH$_3^+$. Power dependence studies at 355 nm show a  $(2 + 1)$ REMPI process for the formation of parent ion. Peaks at  $m/e = 46$, 47 and 61 show two-photon laser power dependence whereas $m/e = 15$ and 45 peaks show four-photon dependence. However, in 532 nm photoionisation, no parent ion signal is observed. A peak at $m/e = 35$ corresponding to SH$_3^+$ has been observed. SH$_3^+$ has been suggested to originate from CH$_3$SCH$_2^+$ via a cyclic transition state. Photoionisation results of CH$_3$SCH$_3$ have been compared with those of CH$_3$SSCH$_3$, at these two wavelengths.</p>

					<p>Oxidation of nine primary aliphatic alcohols by tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) in aqueous acetic acid leads to the formation of the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction is first order with respect to TBATB. Michaelis–Menten type kinetics is observed with respect to alcohols. The reaction failed to induce the polymerization of acrylonitrile. Tetrabutylammonium chloride has no effect on the reaction rate. The proposed reactive oxidizing species is the tribromide ion. The oxidation of [1,1-$^2$H$_2$]ethanol exhibits a substantial kinetic isotope effect. The effect of solvent composition indicates that the rate increases with increase in the polarity of the solvent. The reaction is susceptible to both polar and steric effects of substituents.

Brewster angle microscopic studies on monolayers of  {\bf I} and  {\bf II} at air/water interface showed formation of needle-like domains which seem to cluster faster in  {\bf I} than in {\bf II}. Atomic force microscopy  (AFM) studies also showed fairly uniform sized clusters in {\bf II} whereas in the case of {\bf I} they seem to show varying sizes. From the results it is concluded that  -elongation in the polar head groups leads to controlled cluster sizes in compound {\bf II} as compared to those in compound {\bf I}.</p>

				<title>TRANES analysis of the fluorescence of nile red in organized molecular assemblies confirms emission from two species</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0157-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-resolved area normalized emission spectroscopy (TRANES) is a new method for the analysis of fluorescence of dyes in complex chemical and biological systems (A S R Koti, M M G Krishna and N Periasamy, 2001,  \textit{J. Phys. Chem.} {\bf 105}, 1767). The model-free method extends the power of time-resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) analysis and removes the ambiguity in the interpretation when the emission spectrum is time-dependent. Observation of an isoemissive point in TRANES analysis of fluorescence is an unambiguous indication for the presence of two emissive species in the sample. The isoemissive point occurs at a wavelength where the ratio of the radiative rates of the two species is equal to the ratio of their total radiative rates. The polarity-sensitive nile red dye shows timedependent emission spectra in the organized bilayer assemblies of TX micelle and bilayer egg-phosphotidylcholine (egg-PC) membrane. Time-dependent spectra in complex systems support many important models (solvation model and heterogeneity in the ground and/or excited state). TRANES analysis shows that the fluorescence emission of nile red in TX micelle and egg-PC membrane is due to two emissive species solubilized in different sites.</p>

The complexes have been isolated as their perchlorate salts. The N,N chelators are 1-alkyl-2-(phenylazo)imidazoles (PaiX, X = Me, Et, CH$_2$Ph); 2-(arylazo)pyridines, (Raap,  $p$-R-C$_6$H$_4$–N=N–C$_5$H$_4$N; R = H, Me, Cl); 2-(arylazo)pyrimidines (Raapm,  $p$-R–C$_6$H$_4$–N=N–C$_3$N$_2$H$_2$; R = H, Me, Cl); 2,2 -bipyridine (bpy) and 1,10-phenanthroline ($o$-phen). Unsymmetrical N,N chelators may give two isomers and this is indeed observed. The ${}^1$H NMR spectral data refer to the presence of two isomers in the mixture in different proportions. With consideration of coordination pairs in the order of PPh$_3$, PPh$_3$; N,N (N refers to N(immidazole)) and N ,N (N refers to N(azo)), the complexes have been characterised as  \textit{trans-cis-cis}  and \textit{trans-trans-trans} configuration; the former predominates in the mixture. Electrochemical studies exhibit high potential Ru(III)/Ru(II) couple and quasireversible N=N reduction. Electronic spectra show high intensity ( 10$^4$) MLCT transition in the visible region (520 $\pm$ 10) nm alongwith a shoulder ( 10$^3$) in the longer wavelength region.</p>

					<p>Neutral tetradentate N$_2$O$_2$ type complexes of Cu(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), Zn(II) and VO(II) have been synthesised using a Schiff base formed by the condensation of $o$-phenylenediamine with acetoacetanilide in alcohol medium. All the  complexes were characterised on the basis of their microanalytical data, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, IR, UV–Vis ${}^1$H NMR and ESR spectra. IR and UV–Vis spectral data suggest that all the complexes are square-planar except the Mn(II) and VO(II) chelates, which are of octahedral and square pyramidal geometry respectively. The monomeric and neutral nature of the complexes was confirmed by their magnetic susceptibility data and low conductance values. The ESR spectra of copper and vanadyl complexes in DMSO solution at 300 K and 77 K were recorded and their salient features are reported.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Excess molar volumes ($V^E_m$) and viscosities ( ) of the binary mixtures of 1,2-diethoxyethane with di-, tri- and tetrachloromethane have been measured at 298 15 K and atmospheric pressure over the entire mole fraction range. The deviations in viscosities ( ln ) and excess energies of activation ( $G^{*E}$) for viscous flow have been calculated from the experimental data. The Prigogine–Flory–Patterson (PFP) model has been used to calculate $V^E_m$, and the results have been compared with experimental data. The Bloomfield and Dewan model has been used to calculate viscosity coefficients and these have also been compared with experimental data for the three mixtures. The results have been discussed in terms of dipole–dipole interactions between 1,2-diethoxyethane and chloroalkanes and their magnitudes decreasing with the dipole character of the molecules. A short comparative study with results for mixtures with polyethers and chloroalkanes is also described.</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0235-0244</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser-induced fluorescence excitation and IR–UV double resonance spectroscopy have been used to determine the hydrogen-bonded structure of benzyl alcohol–ammonia (1:1) cluster in a jet-cooled molecular beam. In addition, $ab$ \textit{initio} quantum chemical calculations have been performed at HF/6-31G and HF/6-31G(d, p) levels for different ground state equilibrium structures of the cluster to correlate the calculated OH and NH frequencies and their intensities with experimental results. The broad red-shifted OH-stretching mode in the IR–UV double resonance spectrum suggests strong hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl hydrogen and the lone pair of the ammonia nitrogen. The position and intensity distribution of the calculated NH and OH modes for the minimum-energy gauche form at HF/6-31$G$ level have better correlation with the experimental results compared to other calculated ground state equilibrium conformers. These results lead to the conclusion that the minimum energy gauche form of the cluster is populated in the jet-cooled condition.</p>

					<p>Preparation of the ligands HL$^1$= 2,6-[(N-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-$p$-ethylphenol; HL$^2$ = 2,6-[(N-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-$p$-methoxyphenol and HL$^3$ = 2,6-[(N-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-$p$-nitrophenol are described together with their Cu(II) complexes with different bridging units.

Both the ligands and complexes were characterized by spectral studies. Cyclic voltammetric investigation of these complexes revealed that the reaction process involves two successive quasireversible one-electron steps at different potentials. The first reduction potential is sensitive to electronic effects of the substituents at the aromatic ring of the ligand system, shifting to positive potentials when the substituents are replaced by more electrophilic groups. EPR studies indicate very weak interaction between the two copper atoms. Various covalency parameters have been calculated.</p>

				<title>Theoretical study of the mechanism of proton transfer in tautomeric systems: Alloxan</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0297-0306</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Semiempirical SCF-MO studies of tautomerism in alloxan preclude the possibility of direct proton transfer in the gas phase due to the strain in the four-centred transition state, in which the proton being transferred is forced to come close to the positively charged carbon atom at the opposite corner of the four-membered ring. However, in aqueous solution, the activation barrier reduces appreciably, not only due to reduction in strain, but also due to charge separation in the transition state, which is stabilized due to ionic resonance. The N–H bond is almost broken, while the O–H bond is only partially formed in the transition state. The other stabilizing effect in aqueous solution is due to bulk solvent dielectric effects, which stabilize the transition state to a greater extent due to its higher dipole moment. Although the transition states for proton transfer to the neighbouring oxygen atoms on either side have comparable energies, as the mechanisms of proton transfer leading to the formation of the 2-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy tautomers are similar, bulk solvent effects are larger in the latter due to the higher dipole moment of the transition state. The reason is the almost complete separation of the two entities, i.e. the alloxan anion and the hydronium ion in the latter case, indicating that in this case a dissociative mechanism of the kind encountered in acid–base equilibria is operating.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Detailed X-ray crystallographic investigation of the reactive - and the unreactive -polymorphs of  $o$-ethoxy cinnamic acid has been carried out along with that of the photodimer,  -truxillic acid. The molecule is quite planar in the -form, but in the  -form, the side groups deviate significantly from the plane of the benzene ring.  The carboxylic groups form normal cyclic hydrogen bonds in the  -form and near-symmetric hydrogen bonds in the  -form. The infrared spectrum of the  -form shows the characteristic features of the cyclic dimer, but that of the  -form is entirely different, marked by the absence of the O–H stretching band in the 3000 cm$^{-1}$ region. Charge density analysis throws some light on the structure and reactivity of the molecule in the two forms. The near-symmetric hydrogen bond in the  -form is ionic and appears to restrict conjugation by way of distorting the molecule. This unusual feature keeps the cinnamoyl double bonds away from each other, rendering it photochemically unreactive. In the  -form, however, the double bonds have a closer approach. The cyclobutyl ring of the photodimer consists of weak single bonds, with the new pair being slightly longer</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of oxidation of acidic amino acids (glutamic acid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp)) by sodium N-bromobenzenesulphonamide (bromamine-B or BAB) has been carried out in aqueous HClO$_4$ medium at 30$^\circ$C. The rate shows firstorder dependence each on [BAB]$_o$ and [amino acid]$_o$ and inverse first-order on [H$^+$]. At [H$^+$] $&gt;$ 0 60 mol dm$^{-3}$, the rate levelled off indicating zero-order dependence on [H$^+$] and, under these conditions, the rate has fractional order dependence on [amino acid]. Succinic and malonic acids have been identified as the products. Variation of ionic strength and addition of the reaction product benzenesulphonamide or halide ions had no significant effect on the reaction rate. There is positive effect of dielectric constant of the solvent. Proton inventory studies in H$_2$O–D$_2$O mixtures showed the involvement of a single exchangeable proton of the OH$^-$ ion in the transition state. Kinetic investigations have revealed that the order of reactivity is Asp $&gt;$ Glu. The rate laws proposed and derived in agreement with experimental results are discussed.</p>

				<title>Basic building units, self-assembly and crystallization in the formation of complex inorganic open architectures</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0363-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Careful investigations of open-framework metal phosphates reveal that the formation of these complex architectures is likely to involve a process wherein one-dimensional ladders or chains, and possibly zero-dimens ional  monomers, transform to higher dimensional structures. The one-dimensional ladder appears to be the primary building unit of these structures. At one stage of the building-up process, spontaneous self-assembly of a low-dimensional structure such as the ladder seems to occur, followed by crys tallization of a two- or  three-dimensional structure.  Accordingly, many of the higher dimensional structures retain the structural features of the 1D structure, indicating the occurrence of self-assembly. These findings mark the beginnings of our understan ding of complex supramolecular inorganic materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis and characterization of nanotubes and nanowires constitute an important part of nanoscience  since these materials are essential bui lding units for several devices. We have prepared aligned  carbon nanotube bundles and Y-junction nanotubes by the pyrolysis of appropriate organic precursors. The aligned bundles are useful for field  emission display while the Y-junction nanotubes are likely to be useful as nanochips since they exhibit diode properties at the junction. By making use of carbon nanotubes, nanowires of metals, metal oxides and GaN have be en obt a ined. Both the oxide and GaN nanowires are single crystalline. Gold nanowires exhibit plasmon bands varying markedly with the aspect ratio. GaN nanowires show excellent photoluminescence characteristics. It has been possible to synthesise nanotubes and nanowires of metal chalcogenides by employing different strategies.</p>

				<title>Relaxation in binary mixtures: Non-ideality, heterogeneity and re-entrance</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0393-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Binary mixtures show many kinds of fascinating dynamical behaviour which has eluded microscopic description till very recently. In this work we show that much of the anomalous behaviour can be explained by building suitable models and  carrying out theoretical and simulation studies. Specifically, three well-known problems have been addressed here. (a) Non-ideality in composition dependence of viscosity, (b) re-entrant behaviour of orientational relaxation, and (c) heterogeneity in supercooled binary mixtures. The physical origin of the dynamical behaviour of binary mixtures can be understood in terms of composition fluctuation, a study of which has also been presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Electron–electron interactions in the chemical bond: ``1/3” Effect in the bond length of hydrogen molecule</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0415-0425</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The  prominent  ``1/3”  effect  observed in the Hall effect plateaus of twodimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems has been postulated to indicating 1/3 fractional charge quasiparticle excitations arising from electron–electron interactions. Tunneling shot-noise experiments on 2DEF exhibiting fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) shows evidence for tunnelling of particles with $e$ and  $e/3$ charges for a constant band mass. A "1/3” effect in the hydrogen molecule is seen in as much as its internuclear distance, $d_{H-H} = D^- + D^+,$ with $|D^+/D^-| = 1/3$. This is examined in terms of electron–electron interactions involving electron- and hole quasiparticles, ($e^-$) and ($h^+$), equivalent to those observed in FQHE shot-noise experiments. The ($e/m$) ratio of the ($e^-$) and ($h^+$) quasiparticles is kept at 1: –3. Instead of a 2DEG, these particles are treated as being in flat Bohr orbits. A treatment in the language of charge-flux tube composites for the hydrogen atom as well as the hydrogen molecule is attempted. Such  treatment  gives important insights into changes in chemical potential and bond energy on crossing a phase boundary during the atom-bond transition as well as on models for FQHE itself.</p>

					<p>Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a unique method to obtain epitaxial multi-component oxide films. Highly stoichiometric, nearly single crystal-like materials in the form of films can be made by PLD. Oxides which are synthesized at  high oxygen pressure  can be made into films at low oxygen partial pressure. Epitaxial thin films of high  $T_c$ cuprates, metallic, ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, dielectric oxides, super conduc tor–metal–superconductor Josephson junctions and oxide superlattices have been made by PLD. In this article, an overview of preparation, characterization and properties of epitaxial oxide films and their applications are presented. Future prospects of the method for fabricating epitaxial films of transition metal nitrides, chalcogenides, carbides and borides are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>One of the fascinating fields of study in magnetism in recent years has been the study of quantum phenomena in nanosystems. While semiconductor structures have provided paradigms of nanosystems from the stand point of electronic phenomena,  the synthesis of high nuclearity transition metal complexes have provided examples of nano magnets. The range and diversity of the properties exhibited by these systems rivals its electronic counterparts. Qualitative understanding of these phenomena requires only a knowledge of basic physics, but quantitative study throws up many challenges that are similar to those encountered in the study of correlated electronic systems. In this article, a brief overview of the current trends in this area are highlighted and some of the efforts of our group in developing a quantitative understanding of this field are outlined.</p>

				<page>0487-0496</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this mini-review, I discuss some recent work on the stereochemistry and bonding of lone pairs of electrons in divalent compounds of the heavier carbon group elements  (Sn$^{II}$, Pb$^{II}$) and in trivalent compounds of the heavier nitrogen group elements (Bi$^{III}$). Recently developed methods that permit the real-space visualization of bonding patterns on the basis of density functional calculations of electronic  structure, reveal details of the nature of selectron lone pairs in compounds of the heavier main group elements – their stereochemistry and their inertness (or lack thereof). An examination of  tetragonal $P4/nmm$ SnO, $\alpha$-PbO  and BiOF, and cubic  $Fm3m$ PbS provides a segue into perovskite phases of technological significance, including ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ and antiferroelectric/piezoelectric PbZrO$_3$, in both of which the lone  pairs on Pb atoms play a pivotal rôle.</p>

					<p>Structures of NASICON glasses of the general formula AB$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$, where A = Li, Na or K and B = Fe, Ga, Ti, V or Nb, have been investigated using vibrational (IR and Raman) spectroscopies. Phosphate species appear to establish an equilibrium via a disproportionation reaction involving a dynamical bond-switching mechanism where both charge and bonds are conserved. B ions in the system acquire different coordinations to oxygens. Alkali ions cause absorptions due to cage vibrations. All the observed spectroscopic features are consistent with speciation involving disproportionation reactions.</p>

				<title>Hydrocarbon chain conformation in an intercalated surfactant monolayer and bilayer</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0539-0558</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cetyl trimethyl ammonium (CTA) ions have been confined within galleries of layered CdPS$_3$ at two different grafting densities. Low grafting densities are obtained on direct intercalation of CTA ions into CdPS$_3$ to give Cd$_{0 \cdot 93}$PS$_3$(CTA)$_{0 \cdot 14}$. Intercalation occurs with a lattice expansion of $4\codt 8$ Å with the interlamellar surfactant ion lying flat forming a monolayer. Intercalation at higher grafting densities was effected by a two-step ion-exchange process to give Cd$_{0 \cdot 83}$PS$_3$(CTA)$_{0 \cdot 34}$, with a lattice expansion of $26 \cdot 5$ Å. At higher grafting densities the interlamellar surfactant ions adopt a tilted bilayer structure. ${}^{13}$C NMR and orientation-dependent IR vibrational spectroscopy on single crystals have been used to probe the conformation and orientation of the methylene ‘tail’ of the intercalated surfactant in the two phases. In the monolayer phase, the confined methylene chain adopts an essentially all-trans conformation with most of the trans chain aligned parallel to the gallery walls. On lowering the temperature, molecular plane aligns parallel, so that the methylene chain lies flat, rigid and aligned to the confining surface. In the bilayer phase, most bonds in the methylene chain are in trans conformation. It is possible to identify specific conformational sequences containing a gauche bond, in the interior and termini of the intercalated methylene. These high energy conformers disappear on cooling leaving all fifteen methylene units of the intercalated cetyl trimethyl ammonium ion in trans conformational registry at 40 K.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Diffusion of monatomic guest species within confined media has been understood to a good degree due to investigations carried out during the past decade and a half. Most guest species that are of industrial relevance are actually polyatomics such as, for example, hydrocarbons in zeolites. We attempt to investigate the influence of non-spherical nature of guest species on diffusion. Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of motion of methane in NaCaA and NaY, benzene in NaY and one-dimensional channels AlPO$_4$-5, VPI-5 and carbon nanotube indicate interesting insights into the influence of the host on rotational degrees of freedom and rientational properties. It is shown that benzene in one-dimensional channels where the levitation parameter is near unity exhibits translational motion opposite to what is expected on the basis of molecular anisotropy. Rotational motion of benzene also possesses rotational diffusivities around C$_6$ and $C_2$ axes opposite to what is expected on the basis of molecular geometry. Methane shows orientational preference for $2 +2$ or $1 + 3$ depending on the magnitude of the levitation parameter.</p>

				<title>Computer simulation study of water using a fluctuating charge model</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0579-0590</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogen bonding in small water clusters is studied through computer simulation methods using a sophisticated, empirical model of interaction developed by Rick \textit{et al} (S W Rick, S J Stuart and B J Berne 1994 \textit{J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 101} 6141) and others. The model allows for the charges on the interacting sites to fluctuate as a function of time, depending on their local environment. The charge flow is driven by the difference in the electronegativity of the atoms within the water molecule, thus effectively mimicking the effects of polarization of the charge density. The potential model is thus transferable across all phases of water. Using this model, we have obtained the minimum energy structures of water clusters up to a size of ten. The cluster structures agree well with experimental data. In addition, we are able to distinctly identify the hydrogens that form hydrogen bonds based on their charges alone, a feature that is not possible in simulations using fixed charge models. We have also studied the structure of liquid water at ambient conditions using this fluctuating charge model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water at 298 and 258 K to investigate the effects of hydrogen-bond environment on various single-particle and pair dynamical properties of water molecules at ambient and supercooled conditions. The water molecules are modelled by the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model. We first calculate the distribution of hydrogen-bond environment in liquid water at both temperatures and then investigate how the selfdiffusion and orientational relaxation of a single water molecule and also the relative diffusion and relaxation of the hydrogen-bond of a water pair depend on the nature of the hydrogen-bond environment of the tagged molecules. We find that the various dynamical quantities depend significantly on the hydrogen-bond environment, especially at the supercooled temperature. The present study provides a molecular-level insight into the dynamics of liquid water under ambient and supercooled conditions.</p>

					<p>MgNb$_{2–x}$Ta$_x$O$_6$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2$) phases can be obtained as the major phase (75 to 90$&#37;$) by solid state reactions starting from oxides. These oxides crystallize in the orthorhombic columbite structure till $x = 1 \cdot 75$ and the tetragonal trirutile structure for MgTa$_2$O$_6$ ($x = 2 \cdot 0$). For all the compositions there exist secondary phases like Nb$_2$O$_5$ or Ta$_2$O$_5$ in addition to the major AB$_2$O$_6$ phase. Sintered disks (1200$\circ$C) show dielectric constants varying between 14$\cdot$8 and 16$\cdot$0 for the entire range of composition at a frequency of 500 kHz. The dielectric loss is nearly constant around 0$\cdot$025 to 0$\cdot$03 between $0 \leq x \leq 1$ but increases to 0$\cdot$17 for the MgTa$_2$O$_6$ phase ($x = 2\cdot 0$). Scanning electron micrographs reveal a gradual decrease in grain size with increase in Ta concentration with a size of 3 micron for the $x=0$ composition (sintered at 1200$^\circ$C) while the $x = 2$ phase shows a grain size of approximately 0$\cdot$5 microns. The microwave dielectric constant at $\sim$14 GHz is found to be 20$\cdot$9 for the $x = 0$ composition and $17 \cdot 7$ for the $x = 2$ composition.</p>

The thiolates adopt an unusual bilayered lamellar structure, whose thickness is governed by the length of the alkyl chain.

					<p>Molybdenum disilicide is a high temperature structural ceramic with many attractive properties for engineering applications. Foremost amongst these is its stability in corrosive atmospheres up to about 1600$^\circ$C. However, there are a few undesirable properties that need to be addressed before it can become a viable material in high temperature applications. Since MoSi$_2$ forms thermodynamically stable composites with both metals and ceramics, many reinforcing materials are incorporated into the matrix to improve the fracture toughness and creep properties. The low temperature oxidation can be controlled by making high density ($&gt;$ 95&#37; of theoretical density) compacts. This article summarizes the important attempts that are made in improving the properties of molybdenum disilicide-based ceramics by the reinforcement with other materials.</p>

					<p>A series of ceria-incorporated zirconia (Ce$_{1-x}$Zr$_x$O$_2$, $x = 0$ to 1) solid solutions were prepared by employing the solution combustion synthesis route. The products were characterized by XRD and UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The materials are crystalline in nature and the lattice parameters of the solid solution series follow Vegard’s law. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the solid solutions in the UV region show two intense bands at 250 and 297 nm which are assigned respectively to Ce$^{3+} \leftarrow$ O$^{2-}$ and Ce$^{4+} \leftarrow $ O$^{2-}$ charge transfer transitions. The two vibrational bands in 6960 cm$^{-1}$ and 5168 cm$^{-1}$ in the NIR region indicate the presence of surface hydroxyl groups on these materials.</p>

				<title>Applications of self-assembled monolayers in materials chemistry</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0659-0670</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Self-assembly provides a simple route to organise suitable organic molecules on noble metal and selected nanocluster surfaces by using monolayers of long chain organic molecules with various functionalities like –SH, –COOH, –NH$_2$, silanes etc. These surfaces can be effectively used to build-up interesting nano level architectures. Flexibility with respect to the terminal functionalities of the organic molecules allows the control of the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of metal surface, while the selection of length scale can be used to tune the distant-dependent electron transfer behaviour. Organo-inorganic materials tailored in this fashion are extremely important in nanotechnology to construct nanoelctronic devices, sensor arrays, supercapacitors, catalysts, rechargeable power sources etc. by virtue of their size and shape-dependent electrical, optical or magnetic properties. The interesting applications of monolayers and monolayer-protected clusters in materials chemistry are discussed using recent examples of size and shape control of the properties of several metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles. The potential benefits of using these nanostructured systems for molecular electronic components are illustrated using Au and Ag nanoclusters with suitable bifunctional SAMs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Together with hydrotalcite-like layered double hydroxides, bivalent and trivalent metal hydroxides and their hydroxy salts are actually anionic clays consisting of positively charged hydroxide layers with anions intercalated in the interlayer region. The anionic clays exhibit anion sorption, anion diffusion and exchange properties together with surface basicity making them materials of importance for many modern applications. In this article, we discuss many different ways of making anionic clays and compare and contrast the rich diversity of this class of materials with the better-known cationic clays.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Equilibria of the axial ligation of benzyl(aquo)cobaloximes by imidazole, 1-methyl imidazole, histidine, histamine, glycine, ethyl glycine ester, thiourea and urea have been spectrophotometrically measured in aqueous solutions of ionic strength $1\cdot 0$ M (KCl) at 25$^\circ$C as a function of $p$H. The equilibrium constants are in the order CN$^- &gt;$ 1-methyl imidazole $&gt;$ imidazole $&gt;$ histidine $&gt;$ histamine $&gt;$glycine $&gt;$ethyl glycine ester $&gt;$ thiourea $&gt;$ urea. The order of stability of benzyl(ligand)cobaloxime is explained based on the basicity of the ligand, Co(III) $\rightarrow L d\pi–p\pi$ back bonding and soft–soft and soft–hard interaction. Imidazole, substituted imidazoles, histidine and histamine form more stable complexes than glycine, ethyl glycine ester in contrast to the basicity of the ligands. Benzyl(ligand)cobaloximes were isolated and characterized by elemental analysis, IR and ${}^1$H NMR spectra.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Equilibria and kinetics of the reaction of bromomethyl(aquo) cobaloxime with histamine, histidine, glycine and ethyl glycine ester and iodomethyl(aquo) cobaloxime with cyanide, imidazole and substituted imidazoles were studied as a function of $p$H at 25$\circ$C, $1 \cdot 0$ M ionic strength (KCl) by spectrophotometry technique. The rate of substitution of H$_2$O varies with the $pKa$ of the incoming ligand, thus establishing the existence of nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. Dissociation kinetic reactions were also studied as a function of $p$H. Binding and kinetic data were interpreted based on the basicity, steric crowd of the entering ligand and HSAB principle. To compare the rate constants of the entering ligands $p$H independent second-order rate constants were calculated.</p>

				<title>Dipicolinate complexes of main group metals with hydraziniumcation</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical </feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Some new coordination complexes of hydrazinium main group metal dipicolinate hydrates of formulae (N$_2$H$_5$)2M(dip)$_2.n$H$_2$O (where, M = Ca, Sr, Ba or Pb and $n = 0, 2, 4$ and 3 respectively and dip = dipicolinate), N$_2$H$_5$Bi(dip)$_2.3$H$_2$O and (N$_2$H$_5$)$_3$Bi(dip)$_3.4$H$_2$O have been prepared and characterized by physico-chemical techniques. The infrared spectra of the complexes reveal the presence of tridentate dipicolinate dianions and non-coordinating hydrazinium cations. Conductance measurements show that the mono, di and trihydrazinium complexes behave as 1 : 1, 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 electrolytes respectively, in aqueous solution. Thermal decomposition studies show that these compounds lose water followed by endothermic decomposition of hydrazine to give respective metal hydrogendipicolinate intermediates, which further decompose exothermically to the final product of either metal carbonates (Ca, Sr, Ba and Pb) or metal oxycarbonates (Bi). The coordination numbers around the metal ions differ from compound to compound. The various coordination numbers exhibited by these metals are six (Ca), seven (Ba), eight (Sr) and nine (Pb and Bi). In all the complexes the above coordination number is attained by tridentate dipicolinate dianions and water molecules. The X-ray diffraction patterns of these compounds differ from one another suggesting that they are not isomorphous.</p>

				<title>Lifetimes of $\alpha$-halo and $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations in aqueous solution</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0047-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The title cations were produced in aqueous solution by chemical initiation (solvolysis) of benzyl-\textit{gem}-dihalides and benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides. The solvolysis reactions of benzyl-\textit{gem}-dihalides and benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides in water proceed by a stepwise mechanism through $\alpha$-halobenzyl carbocation and $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocation intermediates, which are captured by water to give the corresponding carbonyl compounds as the sole detectable products. Rate constant ratio $k_x/k_s (M${-1}$) for partitioning of the carbocation between reaction with halide/azide ion and reaction with water is determined by analysis of halide/azide common ion inhibition of the solvolysis reaction. The rate constants k$_s$(s^{-1}$) for the reaction of the cation with solvent water were determined from the experimental values of $k_x/k_s$ and $k_{solv}$, for the solvolysis of the benzyl-\textit{gem}-dihalides and benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides respectively, using $k_x = 5 \tiems 10^9$ M$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ for diffusion-limited reaction of halide/azide ion with $\alpha$-substituted benzyl carbocations. The values of 1$/k_s$ are thus the lifetimes of the $\alpha$-halobenzyl carbocations and $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations respectively.</p>

				<title>Partitioning of methyl internal rotational barrier energy of thioacetaldehyde</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0061-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nature of methyl internal rotational barrier in thioacetaldehyde has been investigated by relaxation effect, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and Pauling exchange interactions. The true experimental barrier can be obtained by considering fully relaxed rotation. Nuclear-electron attraction term is a barrier forming term in the fully relaxed rotation, but it appears as an antibarrier for rigid rotation. It is seen that during methyl rotation, the torsional mode is coupled with the aldehydic hydrogen out-of-plane wagging motion. Natural bond orbital analysis shows that the principal barrier forming term originates from the C–C bond. The lengthening of the C–C bond is explained by considering charge transfer interaction between several bonding and antibonding orbitals in the C–C bond region, which leads to higher bonding overlap for the eclipsed conformer compared to the staggered conformer. S–C($\sigma$)/C$_{\text{me}}$–H$_{\text{ip}}$ and C–H$_{\text{ald}}$/C$_{\text{me}}–H$_{\text{op}}$ interactions appear to be the main barrier-forming Pauling exchange terms but have less contribution to make to the barrier compared to the C–C bond interaction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photoisomerization of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in a polymer–surfactant aggregate is studied using picosecond time resolved emission spectroscopy. The aggregate consists of the polymer, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and the surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). With increase in the concentration of SDS in an aqueous solution of MC540 containing PVP, the emission quantum yield and lifetime of MC540 increase markedly. This indicates marked retardation in the nonradiative photoisomerization process of MC540, when it binds to the polymersurfactant aggregate. The critical association concentration of SDS for binding to PVP has been found to be 0$\cdot$5 mM. This is about 16 times lower than the CMC of SDS in pure water (8 mM).</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0137-0148</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of 34 organic sulphides by $2,2'$-bipyridinium chlorochromate (BPCC) resulted in the formation of the corresponding sulphoxides. The reaction is first order with respect to both BPCC and the sulphide, and is catalysed by hydrogen ions. The hydrogen-ion dependence has the form: $k_{\text{obs}} = a+b$[H$^{+}$]. The oxidation was studied in 19 different organic solvents. An analysis of the solvent effect by Swain’s equation showed that the both cation- and anion-solvating powers of the solvents play important roles. The rates of oxidation meta- and $p$-substituted phenyl methyl sulphides were correlated with Charton’s LDR equation. The rates of the $o$-compounds showed excellent correlation with the LDRS equation. Oxidation of the $p$-compounds is more susceptible to the delocalization effect. Oxidation of the $m$-compounds exhibited a greater dependence on the field effect. In the oxidation of the $o$-compounds, the contribution of delocalized effect is slightly more than that of the field effect. The oxidation of alkyl phenyl sulphides is subject to both polar and steric effects of the alkyl groups. Polar reaction constants are negative, indicating an electron-deficient sulphur centre in the rate-determining step. A mechanism involving formation of a sulphurane intermediate in the slow step has been proposed.</p>

Different rate laws are operative under these three conditions though HOBr is the effective oxidizing species in all the cases. A mechanism involving an intermediate four-membered cyclic transition state between DMSO and HOBr (formation constant $K$), which decomposes in a slow step with a rate constant ($k$) has been proposed. Thermodynamic parameters for the adduct formation step and activation parameters for the first-order decomposition of the adduct step have been evaluated in the temperature range 308–323 K. Activation parameters have also been determined while the orders in [DMSO] are unity and zero. The reaction product has been identified as dimethyl sulphone (DMSO$_2$).</p>

				<title>Effects of preparation temperature on the conductivity of polypyrrole conducting polymer</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0155-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An attempt has been made to investigate the effect of temperature on the conductivity of polypyrrole conducting polymer films prepared by an electrochemical method in an aqueous medium using camphor sulfonate as the dopant. The polymer was grown from aqueous solutions employing a range of temperatures (1–60$^\circ$C). It was found that with increase in temperature the conductivity decreased and the optimum temperature was found to be between 10 and 30$^\circ$C. The results show that the polymer formed at low temperature has higher conductivity and is stronger than that formed at higher temperatures. Characterization by X-ray scattering shows that interlayer distance, $d_{\text{Bragg}}$ (Å), increases with increasing temperature. The morphology of the films formed was studied by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The changes in conductivity and physical appearance were interpreted as being due to compactness in the molecular packing and formation of $\alpha \beta$ linkages in the film.</p>

					<p>Equilibrium study of the mixed ligand complex formation of Fe$^{\text{III}}$ with boric acid in the absence and in the presence of $2,2'$-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, diethylenetriamine and triethylenetetramine (L) in different molar ratios provides evidence of formation of Fe(OH)$^{2+}$, Fe(OH)$^+_2$, Fe(L)$^{3+}$, Fe(H$_2$BO$_4$), Fe(OH)(H$_2$BO$_4$)$^-$, Fe(OH)$_2$(H$_2$BO$_4$)$^{2-}$, Fe(L)(H$_2$BO$_4$) and Fe$_2$(L)$_2$(BO$_4$)$^+$ complexes.

				<page>0203-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The alkylation of ethylbenzene with $t$-butyl alcohol was studied over Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al = 50 and 90) and Al, Mg-MCM-41 (Si/(Al $+$ Mg) =50) in the vapour phase from 200 to 400$^\circ$C. The products were $p-t$-butylethylbenzene ($p-t$-BEB), $p-t$-butylvinylbenzene ($p-t$-BVB) and $m-t$-butylethylbenzene ($m-t$-BEB). Ethylbenzene conversion decreased with increase in temperature and increase in the ethylbenzene content of the feed. The reaction between the freely diffusing ethylbenzene in the channel and the $t$-butyl cations remaining as charge compensating ions yielded $p-t$-BEB. $p-t$-BVB, an unexpected product in this investigation, was produced by dehydrogenation of $p-t$-BEB over alumina particles present in the channels of the molecular sieves. Adsorption of ethylbenzene on Brønsted acid sites and its subsequent reaction with very closely adsorbed $t$-butyl cations proved to be necessary to obtain $m-t$-BEB. Though $m-t$-BEB was obtained, the corresponding $m-t$-butylvinylbenzene was not observed in this study. Study of time durations indicated rapid and slow catalyst deactivation at lower and higher streams respectively.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0233-0246</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The diphosphazane ligands of the type, (C$_{20}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)PN(R)P(E)Y$_2$ (R = CHMe$_2$ or ($S$)-$^\ast$CHMePh; E = lone pair or S; Y$_2$ = O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$ or Y = OC$_6$H$_5$ or OC$_6$H$_4$Me-4 or OC$_6$H$_4$OMe-4 or OC$_6$H$_4$Bu$^t$-4 or C$_6$H$_5$) bearing axially chiral $1,1'$-binaphthyl-$2,2'$-dioxy moiety have been synthesised. The structure and absolute configuration of a diastereomeric palladium complex, [PdCl$_2\{\eta^2$-((O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$)PN(($S$)-$^\ast$CHMePh)PPh$_2 \}$] has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The reactions of [CpRu(PPh$_3$)$_2$Cl] with various symmetrical and unsymmetrical diphosphazanes of the type, X$_2$PN(R)PYY' (R = CHMe$_2$ or ($S$)-$^\ast$CHMePh; X = C$_6$H$_5$ or X$_2$ = O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$; Y = Y' = C$_6$H$_5$ or Y = C$_6$H$_5$, Y' = OC$_6$H$_4$Me-4 or OC$_6$H$_3$Me$_2$-3,5 or N$_2$C$_3$HMe$_2$-3,5) yield several diastereomeric neutral or cationic half-sandwich ruthenium complexes which contain a stereogenic metal center. In one case, the absolute configuration of a trichiral ruthenium complex, viz. [Cp$^\ast$Ru$\{\eta^2$-Ph$_2$PN(($S$)-$^\ast$CHMePh)$^\ast$PPh (N$_2$C$_3$HMe$_2$-3,5)}Cl] is established by X-ray diffraction. The reactions of Ru$_3$(CO)$_{12}$ with the diphosphazanes (C$_{20}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)PN(R)PY$_2$ (R = CHMe$_2$ or Me; Y$_2$=O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$ or Y = OC$_6$H$_5$ or OC$_6$H$_4$Me-4 or OC6H4OMe-4 or OC$_6$H$_4$Bu$^t$-4 or C$_6$H$_5$) yield the triruthenium clusters [Ru$_3$(CO)$_{10}\{\eta-(O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$)PN(R)PY$_2\}$], in which the diphosphazane ligand bridges two metal centres. Palladium allyl chemistry of some of these chiral ligands has been investigated. The structures of isomeric $\eta^3$-allyl palladium complexes, [Pd($\eta^3$-1,3-R'$_2$-C$_3$H$_3$)$\{\eta^2-($rac$)-(O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$)PN(CHMe$_2$)PY$_2\}$](PF$_6$) (R' = Me or Ph; Y = C$_6$H$_5$ or OC$_6$H$_5$) have been elucidated by high field twodimensional NMR spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic studies.</p>

				<title>Bending crystals. Solid state photomechanical properties of transition metal complexes containing semiquinonate ligands</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0247-0254</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The properties of transition metal complexes containing catecholate and radical semiquinonate ligands have often been found to be unusual and unexpected. Crystals of Rh(CO)$_2$(3,6-DBSQ), containing the 3,6-di-\textit{tert}-butyl-1,2-semiquinonate ligand, form as long thin needles that are observed to bend reversibly upon irradiation with NIR light. Crystallographic characterization reveals a stacked solid state lattice with planar molecules aligned with metal atoms atop one another. Electronic spectra recorded in the solid state and in solution show an intense band at 1600 nm that maps the energy dependence of crystal bend angle. The transition is a property of the stacked assembly, rather than of an individual complex molecule, and appears associated with an MLCT process that transfers charge from an antibonding band formed by interacting Rh $d_z^2$ orbitals to the vacant quinone $\pi^\ast$ orbital. Related observations have been made on the [Co($\mu$-pyz)(3,6-DBSQ)(3,6-DBCat)]$_n$ polymer. Photomechanical properties appear associated with electronic transitions that lead to a physical change in axial length of a linear polymer, coupled with a soft solid state lattice that permits axial contraction/expansion without crystal fracture.</p>

				<title>Thiosemicarbazone complexes of the platinum metals. A story of variable coordination modes</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (H2saltsc) reacts with [M(PPh$_3$)$_3$X$_2$] (M = Ru, Os; X = Cl, Br) to afford complexes of type [M(PPh$_3$)$_2$(Hsaltsc)$_2$], in which the salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone ligand is coordinated to the metal as a bidentate N,S-donor forming a four-membered chelate ring. Reaction of benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazones (Hbztsc-R) with [M(PPh$_3$)$_3$X$_2$] also affords complexes of similar type, viz. [M(PPh$_3$)$_2$(bztsc-R)$_2$], in which the benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazones have also been found to coordinate the metal as a bidentate N,S-donor forming a fourmembered chelate ring as before. Reaction of the Hbztsc-R ligands has also been carried out with [M(bpy)$_2$X$_2$] (M = Ru, Os; X = Cl, Br), which has afforded complexes of type [M(bpy)$_2$(bztsc-R)]$^+$, which have been isolated as perchlorate salts. Coordination mode of bztsc-R has been found to be the same as before. Structure of the Hbztsc-OMe ligand has been determined and some molecular modelling studies have been carried out determine the reason for the observed mode of coordination. Reaction of acetone thiosemicarbazone (Hactsc) has then been carried out with [M(bpy)$_2$X$_2$] to afford the [M(bpy)$_2$(actsc)]ClO$_4$ complexes, in which the actsc ligand coordinates the metal as a bidentate N,S-donor forming a five-membered chelate ring. Reaction of H$_2$saltsc has been carried out with [Ru(bpy)$_2$Cl$_2$] to prepare the [Ru(bpy)$_2$(Hsaltsc)]ClO$_4$ complex, which has then been reacted with one equivalent of nickel perchlorate to afford an octanuclear complex of type [$\{$Ru(bpy)$_2$(saltsc-H)$\}_4$Ni$_4$](ClO$_4$)$_4$.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>This article presents a brief overview of the reactions of 2,4,6-\textit{tris}(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tptz) in presence of rhodium(III), ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) under various experimental conditions. Under certain experimental conditions tptz exhibits metal-assisted hydrolysis/hydroxylation at the triazine ring. However, synthetic methods have also been developed to prepare complexes with intact tptz. Molecular structures of some of the complexes, especially stereoisomers of the hydroxylated products, are established by single crystal X-ray studies. A critical analysis of all data suggests that the electron-withdrawing effect of the metal ion (L$\rightarrow$M $\sigma$donation) is the predominant factor, rather than angular strain, that is responsible for metal-promoted reactivities. Electrochemical properties of all of these complexes have been investigated, Rh(III) complexes are excellent catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO$_2$, and dinuclear Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes exhibit strong electronic communication between the metal centres.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0291-0309</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phenomenon of `non-innocence’, first articulated by Jørgensen in 1966, is briefly reviewed. Spectroelectrochemical studies of a range of dinuclear complexes of the type [$\{$Mo(NO)Tp$^\ast$Cl$\}_2$(bridge)] (bridge = dipyridyls) and [$\{$Mo(O)Tp$^\ast$Cl$\}_2$(bridge)] (bridge = diphenolates) which are redox active, show that oxidised or reduced forms of these species exhibit `non-innocence’. The spectral behaviour is associated with metal-to-ligand or ligand-to-metal charge transfer phenomena, probably the first time that monodentate bridging ligands have been implicated in `non-innocent’ behaviour. These bridging ligands also determine the nature and extent of magnetic interaction between the unpaired spins in [$\{Mo(NO)Tp$^\ast$Cl$\}_2$(bridge)] and [$\{$Mo(O)Tp$^\ast$Cl\}_2$(bridge)], the dominant mechanism of spin-exchange relying on the extent of $\eth$-delocalisation within the bridging ligands. The unusual optical behaviour of these dinuclear complexes when oxidised (oxomolybdenum diphenolates) or reduced (nitrosyl molybdenum dipyridyls) has led to the exploration of electrochromism as a means to develop variable optical attenuators operating in the near-infrared region.</p>

				<title>Inverted porphyrins and expanded porphyrins: An overview</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0311-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Porphyrins and metallopophyrins have attracted the attention of chemists for the past 100 years or more owing to their widespread involvement in biology. More recently, synthetic porphyrins and porphyrin-like macrocycles have attracted the attention of researchers due to their diverse applications as sensitizers for photodynamic therapy, MRI contrasting agents, and complexing agents for larger metal ions and also for their anion binding abilities. The number of $\pi$-electrons in the porphyrin ring can be increased either by increasing the number of conjugated double bonds between the pyrrole rings or by increasing the number of heterocyclic rings. Thus, 22$\pi$ sapphyrins, 26$\pi$ rubyrins, 30$\pi$ heptaphyrins, 34$\pi$ octaphyrins and higher cyclic polypyrrole analogues containing 40$\pi$, 48$\pi$, 64$\pi$, 80$\pi$ and 96$\pi$ systems have recently been reported in the literature. These macrocycles show rich structural diversity where normal and different kinds of inverted structures have been identified. In this review, an attempt has been made to collect the literature of the inverted porphyrins and expanded porphyrins reported until December 2001. Since the \textit{meso} aryl expanded porphyrins have tendency to form both inverted and non-inverted structures more emphasis has been given to \textit{meso} aryl expanded porphyrins.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This presentation reports some novel examples of organic ring amination reactions via metal mediation. The organic transformations are highly regioselective and can be controlled by the proper selection of the mediator complex. The two isomeric organic ligands viz. HL$^1$ and HL$^2$ were isolated in their pure states by the removal of the metal ions. These were fully characterized. The ligand HL$^1$ has low $pKa$, $8\cdot 5$. Upon deprotonation, it behaves as a potential \textit{bis} chelating N,N,N-donors. The coordination chemistry of the HL$^1$ ligand involving some $3d$-metal ions is described. Two unusual low-spin complexes of manganese(II) and iron(III) are reported. The ferric complex displayed a rhombic EPR while, the corresponding manganese compound showed a complex pattern due to hyperfine coupling. All the complexes displayed large number of redox responses. A brief mention about the future projection of this work is noted.</p>

				<title>Is copper(I) really soft? Probing the hardness of Cu(I) with pyridinecarboxaldehyde ligands</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0347-0356</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cu(I) complexes of formula Cu(PPh$_3$)$_2$LClO$_4$ [L = 2 or 3 pyridine carboxaldehyde] are synthesised and characterised to explore the coordination of an aldehyde, a hard and neutral oxygen donor to a soft Cu(I) centre. The structural and spectroscopic results illustrate that only in 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, the `C=O' group coordinates to soft Cu(I) centres due to a favourable chelate effect, while in 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, it remains uncoordinated. Upon chelation via N and O donors, 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde resembles bipyridine or phenanthroline in terms of its bite angle and spectroscopic features. Such chelation can be easily challenged with coordinating anions like bromide, or more basic pyridines. A drastic change in the MLCT absorption signals the decomplexation of the `C=O’ group. The observed results point out that the Cu(I) centre can readily exchange the hard `O’ donor for softer ligands.</p>

				<title>Organotellurium ligands – designing and complexation reactions</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0357-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A variety of tellurium ligands has been designed and studied for their complexation reactions in the last decade. Of these hybrid telluroethers, halotellurium ligands and polytellurides are the most notable ones. RTe$^–$ and polytelluride ions have also been used to design clusters. Ligation of ditelluroethers and several hybrid telluroethers is extensively studied in our laboratories. The ditelluroether ligand RTeCH$_2$TeR (where R = 4-MeOC$_6$H$_4$) ({\bf 1}), similar to dppm [1,2-\textit{bis}(diphenylphosphino) methane], has been synthesized in good yield ($\sim80&#37;$) by reacting CHCl$_3$ with RTe$^–$ (generated in situ by borohydride reduction of R$_2$Te$_2$). Iodine reacts with {\bf 1} to give tetra-iodo derivative, which has intermolecular Te$\cdots$I interactions resulting in a macro structure containing rectangular Te-I$\cdots$Te bridges. {\bf 1} readily forms four membered rings with Pd(II) and Ru(II). On the formation of this chelate ring, the signal in ${}^{125}$Te NMR spectra shifts significantly upfield (50–60 ppm). The bridging mode of {\bf 1} has been shown in [Ru($p$-cymene)Cl$_2$]($\mu-\textbf{1}$)[Ru($p$-cymene)Cl$_2$]. The hybrid telluroether ligands explored are of the types (Te$_x$, S$_y$), (Te$_x$, N$_y$) and (Te$_x$, O$_y$). The tellurium donor site has strong \textit{trans} influence, which is manifested more strongly in square planar complexes of palladium(II). The morpholine N-donor site has been found to have weaker donor characteristics in (Te$_x$, N$_y$) ligands than pyridine and alkylamine donor sites of analogous ligands. The singlet oxygen readily oxidises the coordinated Te. This oxidation follows first order kinetics. The complexation reaction of RuCl$_3$.$x$H$_2$O with N-[2-(4-methoxyphenyltelluro)ethyl]phthalimide ({\bf 2}) results in a novel (Te, N, O)-heterocycle, Te-chloro,Te-anisyl-1a-aza-4-oxa-3-tellura-1H, 2H, 4aH-9 fluorenone. The (Te, O) ligands can be used as hemilabile ligands, the oxygen atom temporarily protects the vacant coordination site before the arrival of the substrate. The chelate shifts observed in ${}^{125}$Te NMR spectra of metal complexes of Te-ligands have a close parallel to those of ${}^{31}$P NMR. For the formation of fivemembered rings, the value is positive and of the order of 130 ppm whereas for sixmembered rings it is negative and $\sim$30 ppm only.</p>

				<title>Novel vanadium phosphate phases as catalysts for selective oxidation</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0379-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In our effort to induce novel modifications in the structure of some important vanadium phosphate phases used as selective oxidation catalysts, it has been observed that metal ions such as Zn$^{2+}$, Ni$^{2+}$, Pd$^{2+}$ can be incorporated into the vanadyl hydrogen phosphate VOHPO$_4\cdot$0$\cdot$5H$_2$O phase in very different ways depending upon the medium of preparation. It has been found that the metal ions are either substituted into the lattice with retention of structure of the parent compound or intercalated between the layers of a new mixed-valent phase. These new metalincorporated phases are catalytically active and the palladium incorporated compound in particular displays shape selective catalysis for different oxidation and reduction reactions. In another approach, the preparation of VOHPO$_4\cdot$0$\cdot$5H$_2$O has been modified to give a novel crystalline phase containing mixed-valent vanadium and having NH$_3$ species bound to the lattice. This phase could be a potential catalyst for ammoxidation reactions. In addition, novel mesostructured vanadium phosphate phases have been prepared using a long-chain amine as the templating agent involving a ligand templating mechanism of formation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Redox active mononuclear and binuclear copper(II) complexes have been prepared and structurally characterized. The complexes have planar N-donor heterocyclic bases like 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), dipyridoquinoxaline (dpq) and dipyridophenazine (dppz) ligands that are suitable for intercalation to B-DNA. Complexes studied for nuclease activity have the formulations [Cu(dpq)$_2$(H$_2$O)] (ClO$_4$)$_2$.H$_2$O ({\bf 1}), [$\{$CuL(H$_2$O)$\}_2$($\mu$-ox)](ClO$_4$)$_2$ (L = bpy, {\bf 2}; phen, {\bf 3}; dpq, {\bf 4}; and dppz, {\bf 5}) and [Cu(L)(salgly)] (L = bpy, {\bf 6}; phen, {\bf 7}; dpq, {\bf 8}; and dppz, {\bf 9}), where salgly is a tridentate Schiff base obtained from the condensation of glycine and salicylaldehyde. The dpq complexes are efficient DNA binding and cleavage active species. The dppz complexes show good binding ability but poor nuclease activity. The cleavage activity of the \textit{bis}-dpq complex is significantly higher than the \textit{bis}-phen complex of copper(II). The nuclease activity is found to be dependent on the intercalating nature of the complex and on the redox potential of the copper(II)/copper(I) couple. The ancillary ligand plays a significant role in binding and cleavage activity.</p>

				<title>New mixed ligand complexes of ruthenium(II) that incorporate a modified phenanthroline ligand: Synthesis, spectral characterization and DNA binding</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0403-0415</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The hexafluorophosphate and chloride salts of two ruthenium(II) complexes, viz. [Ru(phen)(ptzo)$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Ru(ptzo)$_3$]$^{2+}$, where ptzo = 1,10-phenanthrolino[5,6-$e$]1,2,4-triazine-3-one (ptzo) – a new modified phenanthroline (phen) ligand, have been synthesised. These complexes have been characterised by infrared, UV-Vis, steady-state emission and ${}^1$H NMR spectroscopic methods. Results of absorption and fluorescence titration as well as thermal denaturation studies reveal that both the \textit{bis}- and \textit{tris}-complexes of ptzo show moderately strong affinity for binding with calf thymus (CT) DNA with the binding constants being close to 10$^5$M$^{–1}$ in each case. An intercalative mode of DNA binding has been suggested for both the complexes. Emission studies carried out in non-aqueous solvents and in aqueous media without DNA reveal that both [Ru(phen)(ptzo)$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Ru(ptzo)$_3$]$^{2+}$ are weakly luminescent under these solution conditions. Successive addition of CT DNA to buffered aqueous solutions containing [Ru(phen)(ptzo)$_2$]$^{2+}$ results in an enhancement of the emission. These results have been discussed in the light of the dependence of the structure-specific deactivation processes of the MLCT state of the metallointercalator with the characteristic features of its DNA interaction. In doing so, attempts have been made to compare and contrast its properties with those of the analogous phenanthroline-based complexes including the ones reported by us previously.</p>

					<p>The coordination chemistry of copper(II) with tridentate aroylhydrazones is briefly discussed in this article. Two types of aroylhydrazones derived from aroylhydrazines and ortho-hydroxy aldehydes or 2-pyridine-carboxaldehyde have been used. The characterization of the complexes has been performed with the help of various physico-chemical techniques. Solid state structural patterns have been established by X-ray crystallography. In the solid state, structural varieties of these complexes are seen to range from monomeric, dimeric, polymeric and onedimensional self-assembly via hydrogen bonds and $\pi-\pi$ interactions. EPR spectroscopy and variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements have been used to reveal the nature of the coordination geometry and magnetic characteristics of these complexes.</p>

				<title>Bridging function mediated intermetallic coupling in diruthenium-\textit{bis}(bipyridine) complexes</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0443-0449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interactions of potentially dinucleating bridging functionalities ({\bf I}–{\bf VI}) with the ruthenium-bis(bypyridine) precursor [Ru$^{II}$(bpy)$_2$(EtOH)$_2$]$^{2+}$ have been explored. The bridging functions {\bf I}, {\bf II} and {\bf VI} directly result in the expected dinuclear complexes of the type [(bpy)$_2$Ru$^{II}\{$L$^n\}$Ru$^{II}$(bpy)$_2$]$^{z+}$ ({\bf 1}, {\bf 2}, {\bf 7} and {\bf 8}) ($n = 0$, $z =4$ and $n = –2$, $z = 2$). The bridging ligand {\bf III} undergoes N–N or N–C bond cleavage reaction on coordination to the Ru$^{II}$(bpy)$_2$ core which eventually yields a mononuclear complex of the type [(bpy)$_2$Ru$^{II}$(L)]$^+$, {\bf 3}, where L = ${}^–$OC$_6$H$_3$(R)C(R')=N–H. However, the electrogenerated mononuclear ruthenium(III) congener, {\bf 3}$^+$ in acetonitrile dimerises to [(bpy)$_2$Ru$^{III}$ $\{^–$OC$_6$H$_3$(R)C(R')=N–N=(R')C(R)C$_6$H$_3$O$^-\}$Ru$^{III}$(bpy)$_2$]$^{4+}$ ({\bf 4}). In the presence of a slight amount of water content in the acetonitrile solvent the dimeric species ({\bf 4}) reduces back to the starting ruthenium(II) monomer ({\bf 3}). The preformed bridging ligand \textbf{IV} undergoes multiple transformations on coordination to the Ru(bpy)$_2$ core, such as hydrolysis of the imine groups of \textbf{IV} followed by intermolecular head-to-tail oxidative coupling of the resultant amino phenol moieties, which in turn results in a new class of dimeric complex of the type [(bpy)$_2$Ru$^{II}$ $\{^–$OC$_6$H$_4$-N=C$_6$H$_3$(=NH)O$^–\}$Ru$^{II}$(bpy)$_2$]$^{2+}$ ({\bf 5}). In {\bf 5}, the bridging ligand comprises of two $N,O$ chelating binding sites each formally in the semiquinone level and there is a $p$-benzoquinonediimine bridge between the metal centres. In complex {\bf 6}, the preformed bridging ligand, 3,6-\textit{bis}(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4,5- tetrazine, H$_2$L (\textbf{V}) undergoes oxidative dehydrogenation to aromatic tetrazine based bridging unit, 3,6-\textit{bis}(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, L. The detailed spectroelectrochemical aspects of the complexes have been studied in order to understand the role of the bridging units towards the intermetallic electronic coupling in the dinuclear complexes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Titanium (IV) phosphates TCM-7 and -8 with mesoporous cationic framework topologies using both cationic and anionic surfactants have been synthesized. Experimental data suggest the stabilization of the tetrahedral state of Ti in TCM-7/8 (O–P–O–Ti–O–, at Ti/P = 1:1) \textit{vis-à-vis} the most stable octahedral state of Ti in the rutile/anatase or pure mesoporous TiO$_2$. Mesoporous TCM-7 and -8 show anion exchange capacity due to the framework phosphonium cation and cation exchange capacity due to defective P–OH groups. Grafting the organic functionality in the surface or bridging the organic moiety in between the inorganic phosphorus precursors can enhance hydrophobicity of these materials similar to that of mesoporous silica materials. The high catalytic activity in the liquid phase partial oxidation of cyclohexene over such organically surface modified mesoporous titanium phosphate using a dilute H$_2$O$_2$ oxidant supports the tetrahedral coordination of Ti in these materials. These materials also show excellent photocatalytic activity in the production of H$_2$ by photo-reduction of water under UV light irradiation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>2D NMR spectroscopy has been used to determine the metal configuration in solution of three complexes, viz. [($\eta^6$-$p$-cymene)Ru(L$^\ast$)Cl] ({\bf 1}) and [($\eta^6$-$p$-cymene)Ru(L$^\ast$)(L')] (ClO$_4$) (L' = H$_2$O, {\bf 2}; PPh$_3$, {\bf 3}), where L$^\ast$ is the anion of ($S$)-(1-phenylethyl)salicylaldimine. The complexes exist in two diastereomeric forms in solution. Both the (R$_{\text{Ru}}$,$S_{\text{C}}$)- and ($S_{\text{Ru}}$,$S_{\text{C}}$)-diastereomers display the presence of attractive CH/$\pi$ interaction involving the phenyl group attached to the chiral carbon and the cymene ring hydrogens. This interaction restricts the rotation of the C$^\ast$–N single bond and, as a result, two structural types with either the hydrogen atom attached to the chiral carbon (C$^\ast$) or the methyl group attached to C$^\ast$ in close proximity of the cymene ring protons get stabilized. Using 2D NMR spectroscopy as a tool, the spatial interaction involving these protons are studied in order to obtain the metal configuration(s) of the diastereomeric complexes in solution. This technique has enabled us to determine the metal configuration as ($R_{\text{Ru}}$,$S_{\text{C}}$) for the major isomers of {\bf 1–3} in solution.</p>

The experimental values of $\rho$ and $\eta$ were used to calculate the values of the apparent molar volume, ($\phi_v$), partial molar volume, ($\phi^\circ_v$) at infinite dilution, $A-$ and $B$-coefficients of the Jones–Dole equation and free energies of activation of viscous flow, ($\Delta \mu^{0^\ast}_1$) and ($\Delta \mu^{0^\ast}_2$), per mole of solvent and solute respectively. The behaviour of these parameters suggests strong ion–solvent interactions in these systems and also that MgSO$_4$ acts as structure-maker in FA $+$ ethylene glycol mixed solvents.</p>

				<title>Isomerization and fluorescence depolarization of merocyanine 540 in polyacrylic acid. Effect of $p$H</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0501-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dynamics of isomerization and fluorescence depolarization of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in an aqueous solution of polyacrylic acid (PAA) have been studied using picosecond time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. It is observed that the dynamics of isomerization and depolarization are sensitive enough to monitor the uncoiling of PAA at high $p$H ($&gt;$ 6). At low $p$H ($&lt;$ 3), when the polymer remains in a hypercoiled form, polymer bound MC540 experiences very high microscopic friction and, hence, the isomerization and depolarization processes are very slow. At high $p$H ($&gt;$ 6) a polyanion is formed and the polymer assumes an extended configuration due to electrostatic repulsion. At high $p$H ($&gt;$ 6), the anionic probe MC540 is expelled from the polyanion to bulk water and the dynamics of isomerization and fluorescence depolarization become faster by 12 and 5 times respectively, compared to those at low $p$H.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of a stable gold hydrosol by the reduction of chloroaurate ions by the amino acid, aspartic acid</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0513-0520</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Development of reliable protocols for the synthesis of nanoparticles of well-defined sizes and good monodispersity is an important aspect of nanotechnology. In this paper, we present details of the synthesis of gold nanoparticles of good monodispersity by the reduction of aqueous chloroaurate ions by the amino acid, aspartic acid. The colloidal gold solution thus formed is extremely stable in time, indicating electrostatic stabilization via nanoparticle surface-bound amino acid molecules. This observation has been used to modulate the size of the gold nanoparticles in solution by varying the molar ratio of chloroaurate ions to aspartic acid in the reaction medium. Characterization of the aspartic acid-reduced gold nanoparticles was carried out by UV-visible spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and transmission electron microscopy. The use of amino acids in the synthesis and stabilization of gold nanoparticle in water has important implications in the development of new protocols for generation of bioconjugate materials.</p>

					<p>Photoinduced electron transfer from chlorophyll-$a$ through the interface of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) headgroup of the lipid bilayers was studied with electron magnetic resonance (EMR). The photoproduced radicals were identified with electron spin resonance (ESR) and radical yields of chlorophyll-$a$ were determined by double integration ESR spectra. The formation of vesicles was identified by changes in measured $\lambda_{\max}$ values from diethyl ether solutions to vesicles solutions indirectly, and observed directly with SEM and TEM images.

					<p>Transition metal ions are notorious for their fluorescence quenching abilities. In this paper, we discuss the design strategies for the development of efficient \textit{off-on} fluorescence signalling systems for the transition metal ions. It is shown that even simple \textit{fluorophore-spacer-receptor} systems can display excellent \textit{off-on} fluorescence signalling towards the quenching metal ions when the fluorophore component is chosen judiciously.</p>

				<title>Photophysical properties of 5-hydroxyindole (5HI): Laser flash photolysis study</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0547-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Steady state fluorescence emission and transient absorption spectra of 9-fluorenone (9FL) were measured in the presence of 5-hydroxyindole (5HI) in highly polar acetonitrile (ACN) environment at ambient temperature. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrate that ground state 5HI as a donor could take part in highly exothermic electron transfer (ET) reactions with excited 9FL, which should serve as electron acceptor. From the transient absorption measurements it is inferred that in geminate ion-pair (GIP) (or contact ion pair), formed initially due to photoinduced ET, the decay of this contact ion-pair occurs not only through ion recombination (back electron transfer to ground state of reactants), but through the other processes also such as proton-transfer (hydrogen abstraction) from radical cation to anion and separation of ion-pair producing the free ions. From the computed reorganisation energy parameter ($\lambda$) and experimentally observed $- \Delta G^0_{ET}$ values it is hinted that there is a possibility that highly exothermic forward electron transfer reactions in the singlet state $S_1$ occur, within present reacting systems, in Marcus inverted region. Back transfer seems to follow the same path. Investigations with similar other reacting systems are underway.</p>

				<title>A new family of donor–acceptor systems comprising tin(IV) porphyrin and anthracene subunits: Synthesis, spectroscopy and energy transfer studies</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0565-0578</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new family of covalently linked `Sn(IV) porphyrin-anthracene’ diad ({\bf 1}), triad ({\bf 2}) and tetrad ({\bf 3}) donor–acceptor (D–A) systems have been designed and synthesized in good-to-moderate yields. While diad {\bf 1} possesses one anthracene subunit at the peripheral (meso) position of the tin(IV) porphyrin scaffold, triad {\bf 2} possesses two trans axial anthracene subunits at the tin(IV) centre. On the other hand, tetrad {\bf 3} is endowed with both the peripheral and axial anthracene subunits in its architecture. These D–A systems have been fully characterised by elemental analysis, FAB-MS, UV-Vis, ${}^1$H and ${}^{13}$C NMR and electrochemical methods. UV-Vis, NMR and redox data suggest the absence of intramolecular $\pi-\pi$ interaction between the porphyrin and the anthracene/s in {\bf 1–3}. Fluorescence from the anthracene subunit in {\bf 1} and {\bf 3} is found to be quenched in comparison with the fluorescence of free anthracene in four different solvents. This is not the case with compound {\bf 2}. Excitation spectral data provides evidence for an intramolecular excitation energy transfer (EET) from the singlet anthracene to the porphyrin in {\bf 1} and {\bf 3}. The energy transfer efficiency is in the order: {\bf 2} (almost negligible) $&lt;$ 3 ($\sim 30&#37;$) $&lt;$ {\bf 1} (nearly quantitative), with the peripheral anthracene $\rightarrow$ porphyrin pathway being largely favoured. This orientation dependence of EET could be analysed using Forster’s dipole dipole mechanism.</p>

				<title>Protein scissors: Photocleavage of proteins at specific locations</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0579-0592</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Site-specific photocleavage of hen egg lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA) by N-(L-phenylalanine)-4(1-pyrene)butyramide (Py-Phe) is investigated in detail with respect to its efficiency, dependence on oxygen, and radical quenchers. Binding of Py-Phe to BSA follows a biphasic process with two binding sites per protein. The photocleavage was achieved upon irradiating a mixture of protein, Py-Phe and Co(III)hexammine (CoHA) at 344 nm. No protein cleavage was observed in the absence of Py-Phe, or CoHA, or light. Photocleavage of BSA was inhibited by degassing or by the addition of radical quenchers such as ethanol. In addition, the photoreaction was quenched by electron donors such as ethanolamine. This result was corroborated by the flash photolysis studies where the cation radical derived from the probe is also quenched by ethanolamine with an equivalent rate constant. Quenching of the singlet excited state of Py-Phe by CoHA followed by the reaction of the resulting pyrenyl cation radical with the protein backbone is the suggested mechanism of protein cleavage. The origin of the specificity of photocleavage is discussed and specificity is valuable in targeting desired sites of proteins with small molecules.</p>

				<title>Photoinduced electron transfer in some photosensitive molecules-incorporated semiconductor/zeolites: New photocatalytic systems</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0593-0602</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) molecule, $p$-N,N-dimethylaminobenzoic acid (DMABA) has been studied in zeolite and colloidal media. The ratio of ICT to normal emission (ICT/LE) is greatly enhanced in zeolites compared to that in polar solvents. The ICT emission of DMABA was quenched by increasing the concentration of TiO$_2$ colloids, while the normal emission was slightly enhanced. Upon illumination of the heteropoly acid (HPA) incorporated TiO$_2$ colloids, interfacial electron transfer takes place from the conduction band of TiO$_2$ to the incorporated HPA which is also excited to catalyze the photoreduction of Methyl Orange. It is found that the interfacial electron transfer mechanism of HPA/TiO$_2$ is quite analogous to the Z-scheme mechanism for plant photosynthetic systems. In DMABA-adsorbed TiO$_2$/Y-zeolite the ICT/LE ratio of DMABA is quite small implying that electron transfer takes place from DMABA to the conduction band of TiO$_2$. This results in drastic enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of DMABA-adsorbed TiO$_2$/Y-zeolite compared to free TiO$_2$/Y-zeolite.</p>

We find that the energy gap between the ground and excited states of the unexcited subunit of allophycocyanin monomer decreases via an interaction with another excited subunit. For allophycocyanin trimer, we find that the fast dynamics results from the fast internal conversion and the first excited state is the only one electronic state which can trap the final population.</p>

				<title>Origin of methyl torsional potential barrier – An overview</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0623-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the evolution of views on methyl internal rotation potential barrier. Various mechanisms proposed for the origin of torsional barrier in ethane have been reviewed. Inadequacy of one dimensional description of internal rotation has been highlighted in small methyl conjugated molecules in the light of its multidimensional nature. The effect of skeletal flexing on the picture of barrier formation by dissecting the barrier energy into potential type, virial type and symmetry type is described. The role of $\rho$ and $\sigma$ electrons at different stages of molecular flexing is discussed. The analysis identifies the dominant contributions to barrier origin as $\pi$-bonding changes during rigid rotation and $\sigma$-bonding changes resulting from bond lengthening during methyl group rotation. The contribution of lone pair electrons in determining the preferred structure of the methyl group in imine compounds such as 1-methyl 2-(1H)-pyridinimine is presented.</p>

				<page>0639-0648</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser isotope separation (LIS) by infrared laser chemistry of polyatomic molecules has come a long way since its discovery. The last decade has seen considerable efforts in scaling up of the process for light elements like carbon, oxygen and silicon. These efforts aim at ways to improve both the enrichment factor and the throughput. The achievement is quite significant especially for carbon isotope separation wherein macroscopic operating scales have been realized. We report our studies on the IR laser chemistry of two promising systems, viz. neat CF$_2$HCl and CF$_3$Br/Cl$_2$. We have investigated conditions for optimizing the dissociation yield and selectivity using natural samples containing $1 \cdot 1 &#37;$ C-13. We also highlight our current efforts for scaling up the process. These include the design aspects of a photochemical reactor with multipass refocusing Herriott optics for efficient photon utilization, development of a cryogenic distillation set up and a preparative gas chromatograph for large scale separation/collection of the isotopically enriched photoproduct in the post-irradiation stage.</p>

				<title>Modelling of multifrequency IRMPD for laser isotope separation</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0649-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The process of infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) of molecules is of great fundamental importance and has practical significance, such as isotope separation etc. Unfortunately, a clear insight into the process has been hindered by the bewildering array of important variables affecting MPD. The dissociation probability $\gamma$ ($\phi$) i.e. the yield has been found to be a sensitive function of laser fluence $\phi$ along with numerous other parameters like laser frequency, gas pressure etc. We have shown that in single frequency IRMPD, an accurate quantitative characterization of the dissociation probability can be adequately expressed by a `power law’ model with two fitting parameters namely critical fluence, $\phi_c$ and multiphoton order, $m$. This model was exploited in analysing our MPD results on various systems. However, the small isotope shift encountered in heavy elements and the sticking phenomenon observed in small light molecules restrict respectively the separation factor and the dissociation yield. These problems can effectively be tackled by irradiation with multifrequency laser beams which can be chosen appropriately on the basis of spectroscopic features. Based on our success in single frequency model, multifrequency IRMPD is modelled by a functional form containing the product of power law terms for individual fluences on irradiation frequencies. This model is successfully benchmarked with our experimental results on multifrequency LIS of tritium. Such knowledge can be utilized for appropriate separation process design, evaluation and optimization.</p>

				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0659-0673</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Selective multi-photon dissociation (MPD) of Freon-22 (CF$_2$HCl) molecules has been carried out using a TEA CO$_2$ laser at various CO$_2$ laser lines (9$P$(20)-9$P$(26)) in order to maximize the yield of C-13 isotope in the product (C$_2$F$_4$) at an enrichment factor of 100. The effects of laser pulse tail due to the presence of N$_2$ in the laser mixture on the enrichment factor and yield of C-13 are investigated. It is found that the addition of a small amount of N$_2$ is possible in the laser mixture without a significant drop in the yield at desired enrichment factor. Addition of a small amount of N$_2$ improves the laser efficiency considerably. At a given pulse energy, a slight change in the near field intensity distribution of a laser severely affects the selectivity of C-13 isotope. The computed far-field intensity distributions of the measured near-field intensities show marked spatial variation in the focal spots that leads to a drop in selectivity. For macroscopic production of C-13 isotope a simple and novel multi-pass cavity has been designed and tested to focus the energy repeatedly keeping the optimum fluence constant at each focal spot.</p>

					<p>The dynamics of formation of oxygen atoms after UV photoexcitation of SO$_2$ in the gas-phase was studied by pulsed laser photolysis-laser-induced fluorescence `pump-and-probe’ technique in a flow reactor. SO$_2$ at room-temperature was excited at the KrCl excimer laser wavelength (222$\cdot$4 nm) and O(${}^3$P$_j$) photofragments were detected under collision-free conditions by vacuum ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence. The use of narrow-band probe laser radiation, generated via resonant third-order sum-difference frequency conversion of dye laser radiation in Krypton, allowed the measurement of the nascent O(${}^3$P$_{j=2,1,0}$) fine-structure state distribution: $n_{j=2}/n$_{j=1}/n_{j=0}$ = $(0\cdot 88 \pm 0\cdot$ 02)/(0 \cdot 10 \pm 0 \cdot 01)/(0 $\cdot 02 \pm 0 \cdot 01)$. Employing NO$_2$ photolysis as a reference, a value of $\Phi_{\text{O({}$^3$P)}} = 0 \cdot 13 \pm  0 \cdto 05$ for the absolute O(${}^3$P) atom quantum yield was determined. The measured O(${}^3$P) quantum yield is compared with the results of earlier fluorescence quantum yield measurements. A suitable mechanism is suggested in which the dissociation proceeds via internal conversion from high rotational states of the initially excited SO$_2$($\tilde{C^1} B$_2$) (1, 2, 2) vibronic level to nearby continuum states of the electronic ground state.</p>

				<title>Interaction between an 8-methoxypyrimido[$4',5'$:$4,5$] thieno (2,3-$b$)quinoline-4(3H)one antitumour drug and deoxyribonucleic acid</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of 8-methoxypyrimido[$4',5'$:$4,5$] thieno ($2,3-b$)quinoline-4(3H)one (MPTQ) with DNA was studied by UV-Vis and fluorescenc'e spectrophotometry as well as by hydrodynamic methods. On binding to DNA, the absorption spectrum underwent bathochromic and hypochromic shifts and the fluorescence was quenched. Binding parameters, determined from spectrophotometric measurements by Scatchard analysis, indicated a binding constant of $3.56 \times 10^6$ M$^{–1}$ for calf thymus DNA at ionic strength 0$\cdot$01 M. Binding to the GC-rich DNA of \textit{Micrococcus lysodeikticus} was stronger than the binding to calf thymus DNA at ionic strength 0$\cdot$01 M. The MPTQ increased the viscosity of sonicated rod-like DNA fragments, producing a calculated length of 2$\cdot$4 Å/bound MPTQ molecule. The binding of MPTQ to DNA increased the melting temperature by about 4$^\circ$C. This research offers a new intercalation functional group to DNA targetted drug design.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Deaerated 5 M NaCl solution is irradiated in the presence of UO$_2$ pellets with a-radiation from ${}^{238}$Pu. Experiments are conducted with ${}^{238}$Pu doped pellets and others with ${}^{238}$Pu dissolved in the brine. The radiolysis products and yields of mobilized U and Pu from the oxidative dissolution of UO$_2$ are determined. Results found for radiolysis products and for the oxidation/dissolution of pellets immersed in Pu containing brine are similar to results for Pu doped pellets, where the radiation chemical processes occur only in the liquid layer of some 10 $\mu$m thickness adjacent to the pellet. The yield of radiolysis products is comparable to earlier results, that of mobilized U from the pellets is $&lt;$ 1$&#37;$ of the total amount of oxidized species. Thus, the radiation chemical yield ($G$-value) for mobilized hexavalent U is $&lt;$ 0$\cdot$01 ions/100 eV. In spite of the low radiation yield for the corrosion, the rate of UO$_2$ dissolution is higher than expected for the concentrations of long-lived oxidizing radiolysis compounds found in the solutions.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence studies on radiation oxidative damage to membranes with implications to cellular radiosensitivity</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0705-0711</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radiation oxidative damage to plasma membrane and its consequences to cellular radiosensitivity have received increasing attention in the past few years. This review gives a brief account of radiation oxidative damage in model and cellular membranes with particular emphasis on results from our laboratory. Fluorescence and ESR spin probes have been employed to investigate the structural and functional alterations in membranes after g-irradiation. Changes in the lipid bilayer in irradiated unilamellar liposomes prepared from egg yolk lecithin (EYL) were measured by using diphenylhexatriene (DPH) as a probe. The observed increase in DPH polarization and decrease in fluorescence intensity after g-irradiation of liposomes imply radiationinduced decrease in bilayer fluidity. Inclusion of cholesterol in liposome was found to protect lipids against radiation damage, possibly by modulation of bilayer organization e.g. lipid packing. Measurements on dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes loaded with 6-carboxyfluorescein (CF) showed radiation dose-dependent release of the probe indicating radiation-induced increased permeability. Changes in plasma membrane permeability of thymocytes were monitored by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by 2,7-dichlorodihydro fluorescein diacetate (DCH-FDA). Results suggest a correlation between ROS generation and membrane permeability changes induced by radiation within therapeutic doses (0–10 Gy). It is concluded that increase in membrane permeability was the result of ROS-mediated oxidative reactions, which might trigger processes leading to apoptotic cell death after radiation exposure.</p>

				<title>An immunomodulator from Tinospora cordifolia with antioxidant activity in cell-free systems</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0713-0719</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several plant products are known to exhibit immense medicinal value against human diseases. Our earlier studies showed that dry stem crude extract (DSCE) of \textit{Tinospora cordifolia} contained a polyclonal B cell mitogen, G1-4A. DSCE as well as G1-4A also enhanced immune response in mice. In order to explore the possibility of using G1-4A/PPI (partially purified immunomodulator) to modulate radiation induced immunosuppression, the antioxidant effect of PPI from this plant was examined against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), generated by photosensitization/peroxynitrite. Levels of lipid peroxidation products, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in liver/spleen homogenate from mouse were monitored. Photosensitization induced significant increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in liver. The activities of SOD and catalase were reduced considerably. PPI, present during photosensitisation, prevented lipid peroxidation and restored the activities of both the enzymes. Likewise, oxidative damage induced by peroxynitrite was inhibited by PPI. The degradation of proteins due to photosensitization as assessed by SDS-PAGE was effectively reduced by simultaneous treatment with PPI during photosensitization. Selective inhibitors of ROS like mannitol, SOD, sodium azide and antioxidants, GSH and vitamin C brought about significant inhibition of formation of TBARS suggesting possible involvement of O$_2^{–\bullet}$,${}^{\bullet}$OH and ${}^{1}$O$_2$. Photosensitization in deuterated buffer enhanced formation of TBARS thus indicating generation of ${}^1$O$_2$. Thus, the action of PPI may be against oxidative damage through Type I and II photosensitization mechanisms. Therefore, the immunomodulator from \textit{Tinospora cordifolia} may also be beneficial as an antioxidant.</p>

				<title>Redox chemistry of $o-$ and $m$-hydroxycinnamic acids: A pulse radiolysis study</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Radiation chemical reactions of ${}^{\bullet}$OH, O$^{\bullet -}$, N$_3^{\bullet}$ and $e^-_{aq}$ with $o-$ and $m$-hydroxycinnamic acids were studied. The second-order rate constants for the reaction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH with ortho and meta isomers in buffer solution at $p$H 7 are $3\cdot9\pm0\cdot 2 \times 10^9$ and $4 \cdot 4 \pm  0 \cdot 3 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$ respectively. At $p$H 3 the rate with the ortho isomer was halved ($1 \cdot 6 \pm 0 \cdot 4 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$) but it was unaffected in the case of meta isomer ($k = 4 \cdot 2 \pm 0 \cdot 6 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$). The rate constant in the reaction of N$_3^{\bullet}$ with the ortho isomer is lower by an order of magnitude ($k = 4 \cdot 9 \pm 0 \cdot 4 \times 10^8$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$s$^{–1}$). The rates of the reaction of $e^-_{aq}$ with ortho and meta isomers were found to be diffusion controlled. The transient absorption spectrum measured in the ${}^{\bullet}$OH with $o$-hydroxycinnamic acid exhibited an absorption maximum at 360 nm and in meta isomer the spectrum was blue-shifted (330 nm) with a shoulder at 390 nm. A peak at 420 nm was observed in the reaction of O$^{\bullet-}$ with the $o$-isomer whereas the meta isomer has a maximum at 390 and a broad shoulder at 450 nm. In the reaction of $e^-_{aq}$, the absorption peaks were centred at 370–380 nm in both the isomers. The underlying reaction mechanism is discussed.</p>

					<p>The kinetics of the reactions of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms with some aliphatic alcohols in aqueous solutions were studied using pulse radiolysis. Based on the increase in optical absorption in the UV region, the rate constants for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms with methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or $t$-butyl alcohol were determined to be $9 \cdot 0 \times 10^8$, $2\cdot2 \times 10^9$,  $2\cdot 0 \times 10^9$, $6 \cdot 2 \times 10^8$ and $1 \cdot 1 \times 10^6$, $1 \cdot 8 \times 10^7$, $5 \cdot 3  \times 10^7$, $2 \cdot 3  \times 10^5$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$ respectively. The bimolecular decay rate constants for the alcohol radicals produced in methanol and ethanol were evaluated to be $2  \cdot 4 \times  10^9$ and $1 \cdot 5 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$. The values observed are in fairly good agreement with those reported earlier.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The free radical scavenging properties and possible antioxidant activity of 1,3-diphenylpropane-1,3-dione ({\bf 1}) are reported. Pulse radiolysis technique was employed to study the one-electron oxidation of {\bf 1} with various radicals viz. CCl$_3$O$_2^{\bullet}$, N$_3^{\bullet}$ and ${}^{\bullet}$OH in homogeneous aqueous solution. All these radicals reacted with {\bf 1} under ambient conditions at almost diffusion controlled rates producing transient species with an absorption maximum around 420 nm that decayed at first order rates. The transient absorption peak was shifted in the case of CCl$_3$OO$^{\bullet}$ radical reaction with {\bf 1} due to change in the polarity of the medium. Formation of a stable product with a broad absorption band starting from 400 nm and cut off at 230 nm was observed in the oxidation of {\bf 1} with ${}^{\bullet}$OH and ${}^{\bullet}$N$_3$ radicals. In a biological system also, {\bf 1} showed significant inhibitory activity against Fe$^{2+}$-mediated lipid peroxidation. Based on these observations, a suitable mechanism for the oxidation of {\bf 1} has been proposed.</p>

				<title>Effect of electron-withdrawing power of the substituted group on ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical reaction with substituted aryl sulphides: A pulse radiolysis study</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>In neutral aqueous solution of (phenylthio)acetic acid, hydroxyl radical is observed to react with a bimolecular rate constant of $7 \cdot 2 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$ and the transient absorption bands are assigned to ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical addition to benzene and sulphur with a rough estimated values of 50 and 40$&#37;$ respectively. The reaction of the ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical with diphenyl sulphide ($k = 4 \cdot 3 \times 10^8$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$) is observed to take place with formation of solute radical cation, OH-adduct at sulphur and benzene with estimated values of about 12, 28 and 60$&#37;$ respectively. The transient absorption bands observed on reaction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical, in neutral aqueous solution of 4-(methylthio) phenyl acetic acid, are assigned to solute radical cation ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 550$ and 730 nm), OH-adduct at sulphur ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 360$ nm) and addition at benzene ring ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 320$ nm). The fraction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical reacting to form solute radical cation is observed to depend on the electron-withdrawing power of substituted group. In acidic solutions, depending on the concentration of acid and electron-withdrawing power, solute radical cation is the only transient species formed on reaction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical with the sulphides studied.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>New symmetrical compartmental binucleating ligands 2,6-\textit{bis[N-(2-$&#123;$dimethylamino$&#125;$ethyl)-N-methyl)aminomethyl]-3,4-dimethylphenol [HL$^1$] and 2,6-\textit{bis}[N-(2-$&#123;$diethylamino$&#123;$ethyl)-N-ethyl)aminomethyl]-3,4-dimethylphenol [HL$^2$], and their copper(II) complexes [Cu$_2$L$^{1–2}$(X)]ClO$_4$, (X = NO$_2^–$, OAc$^–$ and OH$^–$) have been prepared. Spectral, catalytic, magnetic, EPR and electrochemical studies have been carried out. A catecholase activity study indicates that only HL$^1$ complexes have efficient catalytic activity due to a less sterically hindered methyl group and enhanced planarity (larger $–2J$ values) with respect to the oxidation of 3,5-di-$t$-butylcatechol to the corresponding quinone. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility studies of the complexes show antiferromagnetic interaction between the copper atoms. X-band EPR signals could not be observed for polycrystalline samples both at room temperatures and liquid nitrogen, consistent with two antiferrromagnetically coupled copper centres in the solid state. EPR spectral studies in methanol solvent show welldefined four hyperfine signals at room temperature due to decomposition of the dimer into monomers. This however is not seen in frozen methanol glass, may be owing to restructuring of the monomers into dimers due to an increase in viscosity of the solvent. Electrochemical studies revealed chemically irreversible behaviour due to chemical or/and stereochemical changes subsequent to electron transfer.</p>

					<p>Tetravalent metal acid (TMA) salts are cation exchangers due to the presence of structural hydroxyl groups. The presence of protons makes the TMA salt, a potential candidate for solid state protonic conduction. In the present endeavour, amorphous inorganic ion exchangers of the class of TMA salts, tin tungstate (SnW), titanium tungstate (TiW) and zirconium tungstate (ZrW) have been synthesized and characterized for elemental analysis, thermal analysis (TGA, DSC), FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray analysis. Chemical resistivity of these materials have been assessed in various acidic, basic and organic media. Ion exchange capacity has been determined and effect of heating on ion exchange capacity has been studied. The proton conduction behaviour of these materials has been studied by measuring specific conductance ($\sigma$) at different temperatures in the range 30–175$^\circ$C using HP 4192 A impedance analyzer. The specific conductance values for the three materials have been compared.</p>

					<p>The ligand N,N'-diformylhydrazine (DFH) is a resonance hybrid of its keto- and enol-forms. The resonance structures indicate enolisation of one as well as both the carbonyl groups. This indicates the presence of dissociable protons in the molecule. Equilibrium studies carried out with DFH indicate the presence of one dissociable proton. The solid complexes of Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Pb(II) with DFH have been synthesized, and have been characterized by elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, IR, Far-IR, ${}^1$H NMR, TGA, FAB and reflectance spectra. IR and ${}^1$H NMR spectra of the complexes indicate deprotonation of both the enol protons upon complexation. Elemental and TG analyses of Mn(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) DFH complexes indicate 1 : 1 metal to ligand composition. The dimeric nature of the Mn(II)–DFH complex is supported by its FAB spectrum.</p>

					<p>A new spectrophotometric method for the assay of trazodone (TZ) has been described. TZ forms a complex in stoichiometric proportions with phosphomolybdic acid. The released phosphomolybdic acid from the complex with acetone is reduced with a new reductant (cobalt nitrate–ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid) to molybdenum blue, which has maximum absorption at 840 nm. Beer's law limits, precision and accuracy of the methods are checked by the UV reference method.

				<abstract>
					<p>Iminodiazonium ions ($\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations) were produced in aqueous solution by chemical initiation (solvolysis) of benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides. Solvolysis reactions of benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides in water proceed by a stepwise mechanism through $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocation intermediates, which are captured by water to give the corresponding carbonyl compounds as the sole detectable products. Rate constant ratio $k_{az}/k_s$ (M$^{–1}$) for partitioning of the carbocation between reaction with azide ion and reaction with water was determined by analysis of azide common ion inhibition of the solvolysis reaction. Rate constants $k_s$ (s$^{–1}$) for the reaction of the cation with solvent water were determined from the experimental values of $k_{az}/k_s$ and $k_{\text{solv}}, for the solvolysis of the benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides, using $k_{\text{az}} = 5 \times 10^9$ M$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$ for diffusion-limited reactions of azide ion with $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations. Values of $1/k_s$ were thus the lifetimes of the $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations. From the study of effect of temperature on $k_{\text{solv}}$ and $k_s$ the activation parameters are determined and discussed.</p>

				<title>Measures to evaluate heteroaromaticity and their limitations: Story of skeletally substituted benzenes</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0049-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>\textit{Ab initio} HF, MP2, CCSD(T) and hybrid density functional B3LYP calculations were performed on a series of skeletally mono- and di-substituted benzenes, (CH)$_5$Z and (CH)$_4$Z$_2$, Z = C$^–$, N, O$^+$, Si$^–$, P, S$^+$, Ge$^–$, As, Se$^+$, BH$^–$, NH$^+$, AlH$^–$, SiH, PH$^+$, GaH$^–$, GeH and AsH$^+$. Various measures of aromaticity such as the bond length equalization, homodesmic equations, singlet–triplet energy difference (DE$_{s–t}$), chemical hardness ($\eta$) and out-of-plane distortive tendency are critically analysed. The relative energy ordering in skeletally disubstituted benzenes displays trends that are inexplicable based on conventional wisdom. In general, the orthoisomer is found to be the least stable when the substituent is from the second row, whereas if the substituent is from the fourth row, the ortho-isomer is the most stable. Various qualitative arguments, including (a) lone pair–lone pair repulsion, (b) the sum of bond strengths in the twin Kekule forms, and (c) the rule of topological charge stabilization (TCS), are used to explain the observed relative energy trends. The rule of TCS in conjunction with the sum of bond strengths is found to predict the relative energy ordering reasonably well. The reactivity of this class of compounds is assessed based on their singlet–triplet energy differences, chemical hardness and the frequencies corresponding to out-of-plane skeletal distortions. These reactivity indices show less kinetic stability for the compounds with substituents from the fourth row and point to the fact that the thermodynamically most stable compounds need not be the least reactive ones. The $\Delta E_{s–t}$ values indicate that the $\pi$-framework of benzene weakens upon skeletal substitutions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidation of nine aliphatic primary alcohols by quinolinium bromochromate (QBC) in dimethylsulphoxide leads to the formation of the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction is first order with respect to both QBC and the alcohol. The reaction is catalysed by hydrogen ions. The hydrogen-ion dependence has the form: $k_{\text{obs}} = a + b$[H$^+$]. The oxidation of [1,1-$^2$H$_2$]ethanol (MeCD$_2$OH) exhibits a substantial primary kinetic isotope effect. The reaction has been studied in nineteen different organic solvents. The solvent effect was analysed using Taft’s and Swain's multiparametric equations. The rate of oxidation is susceptible to both polar and steric effects of the substituents. A suitable mechanism has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and equilibria of axial ligation of bromomethyl(aquo) cobaloxime by a series of straight chain primary amines (methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, pentylamine, hexylamine), cycloamines (cyclopentylamine, cyclohexylamine, cycloheptylamine) and secondary amines (N,N-dimethylamine, N,N-diethylamine) have been measured as functions of pH by spectrophotometric technique in aqueous solution, ionic strength 1 M (KCl) at 25$^\circ$C. The rate of substitution of H$_2$O varies with the $p$Ka of incoming ligand, thus establishing nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. Binding and kinetic data are interpreted based on the basicity and steric influence of the entering ligand. To compare the rate constants of the entering ligands, pH independent second-order rate constants ($k_{\text{on}}$) are calculated.</p>

The free acids and their hydrazinium salts have been characterized by analytical, IR spectroscopic and thermal studies. IR spectra of all the salts show N–N stretching frequencies of the N$_2$H$_5^+$ ion in the region 975–960 cm$^{–1}$. The thermoanalytical behaviour of the free acids and their salts has been investigated by simultaneous TG and DTA. While pyrazinecarboxylic acid shows single-step endothermic (229$^{\circ}$C) complete decomposition, pyrazindicarboxylic acid shows exothermic decarboxylation followed by identical endothermic decomposition as that of the former. Similarly, salts of the monocarboxylic acid show endothermic effects during pyrolysis, whereas salts of the dicarboxylic acid show endothermic followed by exothermic decomposition. The acids and their salts both undergo complete decomposition to gaseous products.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Phenol is nitrated regioselectively by fuming nitric acid inside the cages of faujasite zeolites (dependent on the loading level) and a remarkable orthoselectivity is observed in solid state nitration. Toluene and chlorobenzene also containing ortho-/para-orienting substituents, undergo faster nitration, though the regioselectivity is less significant in zeolite media. The results are explained on the basis of diffusion and binding of phenol inside zeolite, which facilitate regioselectivity (and which is absent in toluene and chlorobenzene). Other advantages of employing zeolites as media for mild and selective nitration are also highlighted.</p>

				<title>Kinetics and mechanism of protection of thymine from sulphate radical anion under anoxic conditions</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0123-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rates of photooxidation of thymine in presence of peroxydisulphate (PDS) have been determined by measuring the absorbance of thymine at 264 nm spectrophotometrically. The rates and the quantum yields ($\phi$) of oxidation of thymine by sulphate radical anion have been determined in the presence of different concentrations of caffeic acid. Increase in [caffeic acid] is found to decrease the rate of oxidation of thymine suggesting that caffeic acid acts as an efficient scavenger of SO$^{\bullet -}_4$ and protects thymine from it. Sulphate radical anion competes for thymine as well as for caffeic acid. The rate constant of sulphate radical anion with caffeic acid has been calculated to be $1 \cdot 24 \times 10^{10}$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$. The quantum yields of photooxidation of thymine have been calculated from the rates of oxidation of thymine and the light intensity absorbed by PDS at 254 nm, the wavelength at which PDS is activated to sulphate radical anion. From the results of experimentally determined quantum yields ($\phi_{\text{exptl}}$) and the quantum yields calculated ($\phi_{\text{cl}}$) assuming caffeic acid acting only as a scavenger of SO$^{\bullet -}_4$ radicals show that $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values are lower than $\phi_{\text{cl}}$ values. The $\phi'$ values, which are experimentally found quantum yield values at each caffeic acid concentration and corrected for SO$^{\bullet-}_4$ scavenging by caffeic acid, are also found to be greater than $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values. These observations suggest that the thymine radicals are repaired by caffeic acid in addition to scavenging of sulphate radical anions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidation of meta- and para-substituted benzylamines by cetyltrimethylammonium permanganate (CTAP) to the corresponding aldimines is first order with respect to both the amine and CTAP. Oxidation of deuteriated benzylamine (PhCD$_2$NH$_2$) exhibited the presence of a substantial kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 5 \cdot 60$ at 293 K). This confirmed the cleavage of an $\alpha$-C–H bond in the ratedetermining step. Correlation analyses of the rates of oxidation of 19 monosubstituted benzylamines were performed with various single and multiparametric equations. The rates of the oxidation showed excellent correlations in terms of Yukawa–Tsuno and Brown’s equations. The polar reaction constants are negative. The oxidation exhibited an extensive cross-conjugation, in the transition state, between the electron-donating substituents and the reaction centre. A mechanism involving a hydride-ion transfer from the amine to CTAP in the rate-determining step has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of oxidation of five vicinal and four non-vicinal diols, and two of their monoethers, by tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) has been studied. The vicinal diols yield products arising out of glycol-bond fission, while the non-vicinal diols produce the hydroxycarbonyl compounds. The reaction is first-order with respect to TBATB. Michaelis–Menten type kinetics is observed with respect to diols. The reaction fails to induce the polymerization of acrylonitrile. There is no effect of tetrabutylammonium chloride on the reaction rate. The proposed reactive oxidizing species is the tribromide ion. The effect of solvent composition indicates that the rate increases with increase in the polarity of the solvent. The oxidation of [1,1,2,2-$^2$H$_4$] ethanediol shows the absence of any primary kinetic isotope effect. Values of solvent isotope effect, $k$(H$_2$O)/$k$(D$_2$O), at 288 K for the oxidation of ethanediol, propane-1,3-diol and 3-methoxybutan-1-ol are $3 \cdot 41$, $0 \cdot 98$ and $1 \cdot 02$ respectively. A mechanism involving a glycol-bond fission has been proposed for the oxidation of vicinal diols. Non-vicinal diols are oxidised by a hydride-transfer mechanism, as they are monohydric alcohols.</p>

The resins are more selective at pH 10 for Pb(II) and Hg(II), whereas at pH 6 they are found to be Cd(II) and Cr(VI) selective. Metal ion uptake properties of resins follow Freundlich’s equation.

				<abstract>
					<p>Multi-photon dissociation of Freon-22 (CF$_2$HCl) at low temperatures has been carried out to separate the C-13 isotope using a TEA CO$_2$ laser. Yield and enrichment of C-13 isotope in the product C$_2$F$_4$ are studied at 9$P$($22$) laser line as a function of temperature (–50$^\circ$C to 30$^\circ$C). It is observed that at a given fluence when the temperature is lowered the yield decreases and the enrichment factor of C-13 increases.</p>
					<p>Room temperature irradiation of CF$_2$HCl towards the blue edge of C-13 absorption (i.e. at 9$P$(20) laser line) gives low yield of the product (C$_2$F$_4$) at a fluence, which produces the desired enrichment factor of 100. An increase in fluence gives very high yield of C$_2$F$_4$ but the enrichment factor is very low. Irradiating CF$_2$HCl at a temperature of –10$^\circ$C enhances the enrichment factor to 100 and the yield obtained is comparable to that towards the red edge of C-13 absorption (i.e. at 9$P$(26) laser line).</p>
					<p>At a given enrichment factor higher enrichment efficiency is achieved when CF$_2$HCl is irradiated at lower temperature.</p>

				<title>Solvent effects on some new meso-aryl substituted octabromoporphyrins</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0263-0271</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of porphyrins with tolyl and naphthyl substituents at the meso positions, their octabromoderivatives (OBP) with Br substituents at $\beta$-pyrrole positions are synthesised and characterised by chemical analysis, 1H NMR and electronic spectral studies. It is seen that all the OBPs exhibit pronounced red shifts in both the Soret and $Q$ bands of their electronic spectra compared to their nonbrominated form in various polar and nonpolar solvents, the energy difference $\Delta\bar{v}$ being in the range 2300–2700 cm$^{–1}$. The high energy $B$ band of naphthyl porphyrins (both brominated and nonbrominated) are found to be more red-shifted than that of tolyl porphyrins, owing to the noticeable mesomeric effect of the naphthyl groups. Detailed spectral studies reveal that while none of the nonbrominated porphyrin show solvent-dependent change in their $B$ and $Q$ bands, all the OBPs manifest significant shifts depending on the nature of solvents. Solvent–solute interaction can be considered to be of strong dipole–dipole nature for OBPs with polar solvents and of $\pi - \pi$ type with aromatic non-polar solvents. In the brominated form we find two categories of porphyrins exhibiting distinctly different absorption phenomena in aromatic solvents. The OBPs having \textit{meso}-groups not shielding the porphyrin $\pi$-framework exhibit additional absorption peaks (split Soret peaks and broadened Q bands) in some aromatic solvents. This could be explained in terms of $\pi - \pi$ type donor-acceptor (DA) complex formation between such bromoporphyrins (acceptor) and the aromatic solvent molecules (donor) that is not possible for OBPs that have bulky \textit{meso} groups that block the approach of aromatic solvent molecules close to the porphyrin framework.</p>

				<page>0273-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photoamination of 4-nitroveratrole in cyclodextrins with the nucleophiles ammonia, methylamine and hexylamine provides a new route to regioselectivity. This method gives a displaced product para to the nitro group as the predominant product, in contrast to the solution reaction wherein the meta-displaced product predominates. This is due to the change in the mechanistic shift from S$_N$2Ar$^\ast$, wherein the nitro group is meta-directing, to a mechanism involving electron transfer from the nucleophile to the excited aromatic substrate (S$_N$ (ET)Ar$^\ast$) to give the para-displaced product.</p>

					<p>Combustion of dilute propane ($0  \cdot 9 mol&#37;$) over Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ catalysts prepared using different precipitating agents (viz. TMAOH, TEAOH, TPAOH, TBAOH and NH$_4$OH), having different Mn/Zr ratios ($0 \cdot 05 –0 \cdot 67$) and calcined at different temperatures (500–800$^\circ$C), has been thoroughly investigated at different temperatures (300–500$^\circ$C) and space velocities (25,000–100,000 cm$^3$ g$^{–1}$ h$^{–1}$) for controlling propane emissions from LPG-fuelled vehicles. Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ catalyst shows high propane combustion activity, particularly when its ZrO$_2$ is in the cubic form, when its Mn/Zr ratio is close to $0 \cdot 2$ and when it is prepared using TMAOH as a precipitating agent and calcined at 500–600$^\circ$C. Pulse reaction of propane in the absence of free-O$_2$ over Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ (cubic) and Mn-impregnated ZrO$_2$ (monoclinic) catalysts has also been investigated for studying the relative reactivity and mobility of the lattice oxygen of the two catalysts. Both reactivity and mobility of the lattice oxygen of Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ are found to be much higher than that of Mnimpregnated ZrO$_2$. Propane combustion over Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ catalyst involves a redox mechanism.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Effect of added NaCl on the spectral and kinetic properties of cationically charged dye (cresyl violet) and anionically charged surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate) were studied in the pre-micellar and micellar regions. Addition of $0 \cdot 2$M NaCl to dye-surfactant solution decreased the critical micellar concentration for the micellization of the dye in sodium dodecyl sulphate to $1 \cdot 2 \times 10^{–3}$ M. Time-resolved studies using a stopped-flow spectrometer showed that NaCl influences the dynamics of micellisation. Addition of NaCl during the dye–surfactant complex formation converted the complex into micellized form at NaCl concentration of $0 \cdot 01$ to $0 \cdot 05$ M. In contrast, much higher concentration of NaCl (2 M) is required for the salting-out effect of the dye–surfactant complex for conversion to the micellized form.</p>

				<title>Kinetics of proton transfer in a green fluorescent protein: A laser-induced pH jump study</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0307-0317</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sub-millisecond protonation dynamics of the chromophore in S65T mutant form of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was tracked after a rapid pH jump following laser-induced proton release from the caged photolabile compound o-nitrobenzaldehyde. Following a jump in pH from 8 to 5 (which is achieved within 2 $\mu$s), the fluorescence of S65T GFP decreased as a single exponential with a time constant of $\tilde 90 \mu$s. This decay is interpreted as the conversion of the deprotonated fluorescent GFP chromophore to a protonated non-fluorescent species. The protonation kinetics showed dependence on the bulk viscosity of the solvent, and therefore implicates bulk solvent-controlled protein dynamics in the protonation process. The protonation is proposed to be a sequential process involving two steps: (a) proton transfer from solvent to the chromophore, and (b) internal structural rearrangements to stabilize a protonated chromophore. The possible implications of these observations to protein dynamics in general is discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>By using phenylacetylene based rigid-rod linkers (PhA), we have successfully synthesized two fullerene derivatives, C$_{60}$–PhA and C$_{60}$–PhA–C$_{60}$. The absorption spectral features of C$_{60}$, as well as that of the phenylacetylene moiety are retained in the monomeric forms of these fullerene derivatives, ruling out the possibility of any strong interaction between the two chromophores in the ground state. Both the fullerene derivatives form optically transparent clusters, absorbing in the UV-Vis region; this clustering leads to a significant increase in their molar extinction coefficients. TEM characterization of the C$_{60}$–PhA showed large spherical clusters, with sizes ranging from 150–350 nm, while an elongated wire-type structure was observed for the bisfullerene derivative (C$_{60}$–PhA–C$_{60}$). AFM section analysis studies of isolated nanoclusters of C$_{60}$–PhA–C$_{60}$, deposited on mica, indicate that smaller clusters associate to form larger nanostructures.</p>

					<p>The title transformations are oxygen atom transfer, twin isomerization and regiospecific imine oxidation. \textit{Bis}pyridyldiazole ligands have furnished new oxygen atom transfer reagents of coordination type Re$^V^OCl$_3$(NN) which undergo a slower transfer to PPh$_3$ than the corresponding azole reagents. The rate of twin isomerization (linkage and geometrical) of meridional azole complexes of coordination type Re$^{III}$(OPnP)Cl$_3$(NN) to facial Re$^{III}$(PnPO)Cl$_3$(NN) decreases rapidly as $n$ increases in the interval 1–4 (PnP is Ph$_2$P(CH$_2$)$_n$PPh$_2$). An $\alpha$-diimine chelate of type Re$^V$(NPh)Cl$_3$(NN) is shown to undergo facile oxidation to the corresponding iminoamide complex Re$^{VI}$(NPh)Cl$_3$(NN) upon treating with dilute nitric acid. The reaction proceeds via regiospecific nucleophilic addition of water to the more polarized imine function.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Composites of nanometre-sized copper core–copper oxide shell with diameters in the range 6$\cdot$1 to 7$\cdot$3 nm dispersed in a silica gel were synthesised by a technique comprising reduction followed by oxidation of a suitably chosen precursor gel. The hot pressed gel powders mixed with nanometre-sized copper particles dispersed in silica gel showed electrical resistivities several orders of magnitude lower than that of the precursor gel. Electrical resistivities of the different specimens were measured over the temperature range 30 to 300$^\circ$C. Activation energies for the coreshell nanostructured composites were found to be a fraction of that of the precursor gel. Such dramatic changes are ascribed to the presence of an interfacial amorphous phase. The resistivity variation as a function of temperature was analysed on the basis of Mott’s small polaron hopping conduction model. The effective dielectric constant of the interfacial phase as extracted from the data analysis was found to be much higher than that of the precursor glass. This has been explained as arising from the generation of very high pressure at the interface due to the oxidation step to which the copper nanoparticles are subjected.</p>

Starting from the vibrational ground state at zero time, various TD quantities such as the norm, dissociation probability, potential energy curve and dipole moment are examined. Rich high-harmonics generation (HHG) spectra and above-threshold dissociation (ATD) spectra, due to the multiphoton interaction of vibrational motions with the laser field, and consequent elevation to the vibrational continuum, have been obtained and analysed.</p>

					<p>New organic–inorganic hybrid catalysts were synthesized by covalent grafting of proline and benzylpenicillin derivatives into mesoporous MCM-41. These catalysts were extensively characterized using FT-IR, ${}^{13}$C CP MAS solid state NMR, XRD and TEM techniques. These were used as catalysts for direct, asymmetric aldol reaction between acetone and activated aromatic aldehydes. In the reaction of 4-nitro and 4-fluoro benzaldehyde, the aldol products were obtained in 36$&#37;$ and 59$&#37;$ \textit{ee} respectively. The catalysts were reusable with neither significant drop in enantioselectivity nor loss of mesostructure. An attempt was made to substantiate the proposed `enamine’ mechanism for direct aldol reaction by trapping the intermediate between proline-MCM-41 and acetone.</p>

Core level X-ray photoelectron spectra of Ce $3d$ as well as resonant photoemission spectra obtained at the Ce $4d \Rightarrow 4f$ resonant absorption threshold establish Ce as being in the trivalent state throughout the series. Using the `off-resonance’ condition for Ce $4f$ states, we obtain the Ti $3d$ dominated spectral features close to $E_F$, exhibiting clear signatures of coherent and incoherent peaks. We discuss the implications of our findings in relation to the metal–insulator transition observed in this series of compounds.</p>

					<p>We describe a novel process for the production of nanoparticles of Cu, Ag, Fe and Al which involves exploding their respective wires, triggered by large current densities in the wires. The particles are characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Particle sizes in the range 20–100nm were obtained employing this technique. The XRD results reveal that the nanoparticles continue to retain lattice periodicity at reduced particle sizes, displaying in some cases evidence of lattice strain and preferential orientation. In the case of Fe, Mossbauer spectroscopy reveals loss of ferromagnetism as a result of the reduced size of the particles.</p>

Accordingly the precursor was observed to undergo a number of changes in both the molybdenum (VI) coordination and long-range ordering during this heating. Initially the two other forms of bismuth molybdate ($\alpha$-and $\gamma$-phases) were observed to form from the poorly crystalline precursor at about 230$^\circ$C, however, the $\beta$-phase eventually crystallised after prolonged heating at 560$^\circ$C.</p>

				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0533-0542</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We consider an interacting one-dimensional molecular wire attached to two metal electrodes on either side of it. The electrostatic potential profile across the wire-electrode interface has been deduced solving the Schrodinger and Poisson equations self-consistently. Since the Poisson distribution crucially depends on charge densities, we have considered different Hamiltonian parameters to model the nanoscale wire. We find that for very weak electron correlations, the potential gradient is almost zero in the middle of the wire but are large near the chain ends. However, for strong correlations, the potential is essentially a ramp function. The nonlinear current, obtained from the scattering formalism, is found to be less with the ramp potential than for weak correlations. Some of the interesting features in current–voltage characteristics have been explained using one-electron formalism and instabilities in the system.</p>

				<title>Influence of temperature inhomogeneity on product profile of reactions occurring within zeolites¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0543-0552</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In zeolites, diffusion is often accompanied by a reaction or sorption which in turn can induce temperature inhomogeneities. Monte Carlo simulations of Lennard–Jones atoms in zeolite NaCaA are reported for the presence of a hot zone presumed to be created by a reaction or chemi- or physi-sorption site. These simulations show that the presence of localized hot regions can alter both kinetic and transport properties such as diffusion. Further, we show that enhancement of diffusion constant is greater for systems with larger barrier height, a surprising result that may be of considerable significance in many chemical and biological processes. We find an unanticipated coupling between reaction and diffusion due to the presence of a hot zone in addition to that which normally exists via concentration. Implications of this coupling for the product profile of a reaction are discussed. We also propose a mechanism by which mobility of ions or diffusion of molecular species within biomembranes may take place.</p>

					<p>The results of X-ray diffraction, and ac and dc magnetisation as a function of temperature are reported for a new class of spin-chain oxides, Ca$_3$Co$_{1+x}$Ir$_{1–x}O$_6$. While the $x = 0 \cdot 0$, $0 \cdot  3$, $0 \cdot 5$ and $1 \cdot 0$ are found to form in the K$_4$CdCl$_6$-derived rhombhohedral (space group $R\bar{3}c$) structure, the $x = 0 \cdot 7$ composition is found to undergo a monoclinic distortion in contrast to a literature report. Apparently, the change in the crystal symmetry with x manifests itself as a change in the sign of paramagnetic Curie temperature for this composition as though magnetic coupling sensitively depends on such crystallographic distortions. All the compositions exhibit spin-glass anomalies with an unusually \textit{large} frequency dependence of the peak temperature in $ac$ susceptibility in a temperature range below 50 K, interestingly obeying Vogel–Fulcher relationship even for the stoichiometric compounds.</p>

The resulting materials were characterised by TGA, XRD, UV-Vis-DRS, EPR, SEM and surface area measurements. XRD and DRS results indicated fine dispersion of the ceria component in the ZnO matrix. EPR results clearly indicate the presence of oxygen vacancy and defect centres in the composite oxide. Addition of CeO$_2$ to ZnO produced mixed oxides of high surface area compared to the pure ZnO. Hydrogen transfer reaction was carried out on these catalytic materials to investigate the effect of rare earth oxide on the activity of ZnO. Addition of ceria into zinc oxide was found to increase the catalytic activity for hydrogen transfer reaction. The catalytic activity also depended on the method of preparation.

					<p>A hydrothermal reaction of a mixture of Y(NO$_3$)$_3$, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid (1,2-BDC) and NaOH gives rise to a new yttrium phthalate coordination polymer, [Y$_4$(H$_2$O)$_2$(C$_8$H$_4$O$_4$)$_6$]$_\infty$, {\bf I}. The Y ions in {\bf I} are present in four different coordination environments with respect to the oxygen atoms (CN6 = octahedral, CN7 = pentagonal bipyramid, CN8 = dodecahedron and CN9 =capped square antiprism). The oxygen atoms of the 1,2-BDC are fully deprotonated, and show variations in their connectivity with Y atoms. The Y atoms themselves are connected through their vertices forming infinite Y–O–Y one-dimensional chains. The Y–O–Y chains are cross-linked by the 1,2-BDC anions forming a corrugated layer structure. The layers are supported by favourable $\pi \ldots \pi$ interactions between the benzene rings of the 1,2-BDC anions. The variations in the coordination environment of the Y atoms and the presence of Y–O–Y interactions along with the favourable $\pi \ldots \pi$ interactions between the benzene rings from different layers are noteworthy structural features. Crystal data: triclinic, space group = $P–1$ (no. 2), $a = 12 \cdot 6669$ (2), $b = 13 \cdot 8538$ (2), $c = 16 \cdot 0289$ Å, $a = 75 \cdot 20$ (1), $\beta = 69 \cdot 012$ (1), $\gamma = 65 \cdot 529$ (1)°, $V = 2371 \cdot 28$ (7) Å$^3$, $D_{\text{calc}} = 1 \cdot 922$ g cm$^{–1}$, $\mu_{\text(MoK\alpha)} = 4 \cdot 943$ mm$^{–1}$.

				<title>Properties of CMR composites¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0587-0606</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) composites form an interesting field of study. The intrinsic CMR, governed by the intragrain transport of the conduction electrons through the double exchange, limits its application owing to the high field requirement and generally low transition temperatures. Extrinsic CMR, a function of the intergrain transport between ferromagnetic (FM) particles, plays a crucial role in enhancing low field magnetoresistance (LFMR) or increasing room temperature magnetoresistance. Since extrinsic CMR is a grain boundary controlled phenomena, magnetically dirty grain boundaries in the virgin state of the sample help in achieving a high LFMR or increase the field sensitivity. In this article, we give the properties of different composites of magnetoresistive LCMO or LSMO where the second component is (a) an insulating phase, (b) a conducting phase, (c) a nonmagnetic phase and (d) a magnetic phase. We present here some of our recent work on CMR composites where the CMR phase is chosen as LCMO and SiO$_2$, ZnO, ZrO$_2$ and SiCN have been used as the different second phase of the composites. We summarise some of the salient features of the results.</p>

				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0613-0619</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nanoparticles have properties that can be fine-tuned by their size as well as shape. Hence, there is significant current interest in preparing nano-materials of small size dispersity and to arrange them in close-packed aggregates. This manuscript describes ways of synthesising gold nanoparticles using a metal-chelator derivative {\bf 1}, as stabiliser. Controlled synthesis conditions lead to formation of nanoparticles thereby indicating the ability of {\bf 1} to act as efficient stabiliser. The nanoparticles formed were characterised by transmission electron microscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. TEM analysis showed the formation of dense aggregates of nanoparticles. This can be ascribed to the inter-particle hydrogen bonding possible by the carboxylic acid moiety of {\bf 1} that leads to aggregation. The aggregation can be controlled by the pH of the solution employed for dispersing the particles.</p>

				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0621-0636</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Folding dynamics and energy landscape picture of protein conformations of HP-36 and $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) are investigated by extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, where the inter amino acid interactions are given by a minimalistic model (MM) we recently introduced [\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 118} 4733 (2003)]. In this model, a protein is constructed by taking two atoms for each amino acid. One atom represents the backbone C$_{\alpha}$ atom, while the other mimics the whole side chain residue. Sizes and interactions of the side residues are all different and specific to a particular amino acid. The effect of water-mediated folding is mapped into the MM by suitable choice of interaction parameters of the side residues obtained from the amino acid hydropathy scale. A new non-local helix potential is incorporated to generate helices at the appropriate positions in a protein. Simulations have been done by equilibrating the protein at high temperature followed by a sudden quench. The subsequent folding is monitored to observe the dynamics of topological contacts ($N_{topo}$), relative contact order parameter (RCO), and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the realprotein native structure. The folded structures of different model proteins (HP-36 and $A\beta$) resemble their respective real native state rather well. The dynamics of folding shows \textit{multistage decay}, with an initial hydrophobic collapse followed by a long plateau. Analysis of $N_{topo}$ and RCO correlates the late stage folding with rearrangement of the side chain residues, particularly those far apart in the sequence. The long plateau also signifies large entropic free energy barrier near the native state, as predicted from theories of protein folding.</p>

				<title>Aromaticity in benzene-like rings – An experimental electron density investigation¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0637-0647</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An experimental charge density study has been carried out on perylene based on X-ray diffraction measurements at 130 K. The electron density and its associated properties have been evaluated at the bond and the ring critical points for the naphthalene residues as well as for the central ring. The variation of the Laplacian along the axis, above and below the ring plane, is found to be symmetric for the central ring while for the naphthalene rings, the Laplacian values are enhanced under the bow-shaped region. A plot of the Laplacian versus density evaluated at various points along the axis above the ring plane, shows a steep variation in the case of the central ring implying that the $\pi$-density is smeared out compared to that over the naphthalene rings. Similar data extracted from a quinoid ring and a regular phenyl ring (both based on earlier reports from this laboratory) exhibit increasingly shallower trends and indicate, by contrast, that the central ring of perylene is much less aromatic.</p>

				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0663-0677</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of $n$-hexane on the basal plane of graphite at monolayer and multilayer coverages. In keeping with experimental data, we find the presence of ordered adsorbed layers both at single monolayer coverage and when the adsorbed layer coexists with excess liquid adsorbate. Using a simulation method that does not impose any particular periodicity on the adsorbed layer, we quantitatively compare our results to the results of neutron diffraction experiments and find a structural transition from a uniaxially incommensurate lattice to a fully commensurate structure on increasing the coverage from a monolayer to a multilayer. The zig-zag backbone planes of all the alkane molecules lie parallel to the graphite surface at the multilayer coverage, while a few molecules are observed to attain the perpendicular orientation at monolayer coverage.</p>

				<title>Water-dispersible nanoparticles via interdigitation of sodium dodecylsulphate molecules in octadecylamine-capped gold nanoparticles at a liquid–liquid interface¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0679-0687</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the formation of water-dispersible gold nanoparticles capped with a bilayer of sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) and octadecylamine (ODA) molecules. Vigorous shaking of a biphasic mixture consisting of ODA-capped gold nanoparticles in chloroform and SDS in water results in the rapid phase transfer of ODA-capped gold nanoparticles from the organic to the aqueous phase, the latter acquiring a pink, foam-like appearance in the process. Drying of the coloured aqueous phase results in the formation of a highly stable, reddish powder of gold nanoparticles that may be readily redispersed in water. The water-dispersible gold nanoparticles have been investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). These studies indicate the presence of interdigitated bilayers consisting of an ODA primary monolayer directly coordinated to the gold nanoparticle surface and a secondary monolayer of SDS, this secondary monolayer providing sufficient hydrophilicity to facilitate gold nanoparticle transfer into water and rendering them water-dispersible.</p>

				<title>A low-cost Raman spectrometer design used to study Raman scattering from a single-walled carbon nanotube¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0689-0694</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper discusses the design of a low cost Raman spectrometer. Singlewalled nanotubes (SWNT) have been studied to demonstrate the reach of such a system. We observe both the radial-breathing mode (RBM) and the tangential mode from the SWNT. The tube diameters of the SWNT used in these experiments have been determined using RBM to be predominantly 1$\cdot$4 and 1$\cdot$6nm. These are consistent with the TEM images taken of the same sample. The new method of producing SWNT using Ni–Y catalyst in electric-arc discharge method produces nanotubes with very small dispersion in diameter and high yields. The chirality of the SWNT can be deduced from their radial breathing modes, and it suggests that they are metallic in nature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Y$_2$W$_3$O$_{12}$ exhibits negative thermal expansion along the three crystallographic directions due to the transverse thermal vibrations perpendicular to the Y–O–W linkage. It is highly hygroscopic and forms a trihydrate structure at room temperature. Dilatometric studies of Y$_2$W$_3$O$_{12}$ show large thermal expansion hysteresis due to large grain size and a large initial positive thermal expansion due to the removal of water molecules. Al$_2$O$_3$ has been added to Y$_2$W$_3$O$_{12}$ up to 10 wt$&#37;$ in an attempt to overcome the hygroscopicity and reduce the particle size and thereby the thermal expansion hysteresis. Thermo gravimetric, dilatometric and electron microscopic studies are presented to support these observations.</p>

The material has been characterised using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and emission spectroscopy. The material is stable and the freestanding particles can be precipitated and redispersed in several solvents. Confinement of the molecule is complete as leaching through the shell is minimal. The material behaves like free ciprofloxacin in solution; however, effects of confinement are manifested. Energy transfer reaction between ciprofloxacin$&#64;$SiO$_2$ and Tb$^{3+}$ was monitored by emission spectroscopy. The emission intensity decreased with metal ion exposure indicating selective electronic interaction.</p>

				<title>Heptaphyrins: Expanded porphyrins with seven heterocyclic rings¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0711-0720</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Expanded porphyrins containing seven pyrrole/heterocyclic rings linked in a cyclic fashion are termed heptaphyrins. The number of $\pi$-electrons in heptaphyrins depends on the number of \textit{meso} carbon bridges used to link the heterocyclic rings, accordingly heptaphyrins with $28\pi$-electrons and 30 $\pi$-electrons are reported to date. Both condensation reactions of the appropriate precursors and acid-catalysed oxidative coupling reactions have been utilized to synthesise the heptaphyrins. The 30$\pi$ heptaphyrins exhibit rich structural diversity where some of the heterocyclic rings in the macrocycle undergo a 180$^{\circ}$ ring flipping. An overview of the synthetic methods employed for the synthesis of heptaphyrins, their spectroscopic properties, structural behaviour and aromatic properties are highlighted in this paper.</p>

The dppe-yl behaves as an ambidentate ligand; it functions as a monodentate P-donor ligand with a dangling ylidic carbon in the neutral chloro complex, [(COD)Rh(Cl)(dppe-yl)] ({\bf 1}), whereas replacement of the chloride by a non-coordinating counter anion results in the formation of the complexes, [(COD)Rh(L-L')]$^+$ (L-L' = dppe-yl ({\bf 2}) or dppm-yl ({\bf 3})) respectively in which the ligands are bonded to the metal via the phosphorus and the ylidic carbon atoms.

				<title>Investigations on geometrical features in induced ordering of collagen by small molecules¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0751-0766</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Binding energies of the interaction of collagen like triple helical peptides with a series of polyphenols, viz. gallic acid, catechin, epigallocatechingallate and pentagalloylglucose have been computed using molecular modelling approaches. A correlation of calculated binding energies with the interfacial molecular volumes involved in the interaction is observed. Calculated interface surface areas for the binding of polyphenols with collagen-like triple helical peptides vary in the range of 60–210 Å$^2$ and hydrogen bond lengths vary in the range of 2$\cdot$7–3$\cdot$4 Å. Interfacial molecular volumes can be calculated from the solvent inaccessible surface areas and hydrogen bond lengths involved in the binding of polyphenols to collagen. Molecular aggregation of collagen in the presence of some polyphenols and chromium (III) salts has been probed experimentally in monolayer systems. The monolayer arrangement of collagen seems to be influenced by the presence of small molecules like formaldehyde, gluteraldehyde, tannic acid and chromium (III) salts. A fractal structure is observed on account of two-dimensional aggregation of collagen induced by tanning species. Atomic force microscopy has been employed to probe the topographic images of two-dimensional aggregation of collagen induced by chromium (III) salts. A case is made that long-range ordering of collagen by molecular species involved in its stabilisation is influenced by molecular geometries involved in its interaction with small molecules.</p>

				<title>Colossal magnetoresistance manganites: A new approach¶</title>

				<page>0767-0774</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Manganites of the LA$_{1–x}$Ca$_x$MnO$_3$ family show a variety of new and poorly understood electronic, magnetic and structural effects. Here we outline a new approach recently proposed by us, where we argue that due to strong Jahn–Teller (JT) coupling with phonons the twofold degenerate $e_g$ states at the Mn sites dynamically reorganize themselves into localised, JT polarons $\ell$ with exponentially small inter-site hopping, and band-like, nonpolaronic states $b$, leading to a \textit{new 2-band model for manganites} which includes strong Coulomb and Hund’s couplings. We also discuss some results from a dynamical mean-field theory treatment of the model which explains quantitatively a wide variety of experimental results, including insulator– metal transitions and CMR, in terms of the influence of physical conditions on the relative energies and occupation of the $\ell$ and $b$ states. We argue that this microscopic coexistence of the two types of electronic states, and their relative occupation and spatial correlation is the key to manganite physics.</p>

					<p>Relaxor properties of 0$\cdot$7Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$–0$\cdot$3PbTiO$_{3}$ (PMN-PT) and non-lead perovskite thin films have been analysed in terms of large frequency dispersion of dielectric response at low temperatures. A wide spectrum of dielectric relaxation was observed in the frequency-dependent response of the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity. Transformation from normal ferroelectric to relaxor behaviour has been observed in the case of the Ca substituting the BaTiO$_3$ thin films. A number of techniques were exploited to investigate the wide spectrum of relaxation times in pulsed laser ablated thin films. $ac$ and $dc$ electric field induced complex dielectric properties of 0$\cdot$7Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$–0$\cdot$3PbTiO$_3$ (PMN-PT) thin films were studied as function of frequencies at different temperatures. Nonlinear behaviour of dielectric susceptibility with respect to the amplitude of the $ac$ drive was observed at lower temperatures. The frequency dependence of transition temperature $T_m$ (temperature of the maximum of dielectric constant) was studied using the Vogel–Fulcher relation.</p>

				<title>A study of partial molar volumes of citric acid and tartaric acid in water and binary aqueous mixtures of ethanol at various temperatures</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0033-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Partial molar volumes of citric acid and tartaric acid have been determined in water and binary aqueous mixtures of ethanol (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25$&#37;$ by weight of ethanol) at different temperatures and acid concentrations from the solution density measurements. The data have been evaluated by using Masson equation and the obtained parameters have been interpreted in terms of solute–solvent interactions. The partial molar volumes vary with temperature as a power series of temperature. Structure making/breaking capacities of the organic acids have been inferred from the sign of [$\partial^{2} \phi^0_v/ T^2$]$_p$, i.e. secondderivative of partial molar volume with respect to temperature at constant pressure. Both the organic acids behave as structure breakers in water and water $+$ ethanol.</p>

				<title>Excess molar volumes and viscosities of binary mixtures of some polyethers with 1-propanol at 288$\cdot$15, 298$\cdot$15, and 308$\cdot$15 K</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Excess molar volumes ($V_m^E$) and viscosities ($\eta$) have been measured as a function of composition for binary liquid mixtures of 1-propanol, C$_3$H$_7$OH, with diethylene glycol diethyl ether (\textit{bis}(2-ethoxyethyl)ether), C$_2$H$_5$(OC$_2$H$_4$)$_2$OC$_2$H$_5$, and diethylene glycol dibutyl ether (\textit{bis}(2-butoxyethyl)ether), C$_4$H$_9$(OC$_2$H$_4$)$_2$OC$_4$H$_9$, at 288$\cdot$15, 298$\cdot$15, and 308$\cdot$15 K and at atmospheric pressure. The excess volume results included the following mixing quantities at all range of concentrations and at equimolar concentrations: $\alpha$, volume expansivity; ($\partial V^E_m/\partial T$)$_P$, and ($\partial H^E/\partial P$)$_T$ at 298$\cdot$15 K. The obtained results were then compared with the calculated values by using the Flory theory of liquid mixtures. The theory predicts the $\alpha$ values rather well, while the calculated values of ($\partial V^E_m/\partial T$)$_P$ and ($\partial H^E/\partial P$)$_T$ show variation with alkyl chain length of the polyether. The results are discussed in terms of order or disorder creation. From the viscosity data, deviations in viscosity ($\Delta \eta$) have been calculated. These values are negative over the entire range of composition. The results for $V^E_m$, and $\Delta \eta$ are discussed in terms of interaction between components.</p>

				<title>Anodically generated manganese(III) sulphate for the oxidation of dipeptides in aqueous sulphuric acid medium: A kinetic study</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0049-0053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetic of oxidation of dipeptides (DP) namely valyl–glycine (Val–Gly), alanyl–glycine (Ala–Gly) and glycyl–glycine (Gly–Gly), by Mn(III) have been studied in the presence of sulphate ions in acid medium at 26$^\circ$C. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ = 500 nm. A firstorder dependence of the rate on both [Mn(III)]$_o$ and [DP]$_o$ was observed. The rate is independent of the concentration of reduction product, Mn(II) and hydrogen ions. The effects of varying the dielectric constant of the medium and addition of anions such as sulphate, chloride and perchlorate were studied. The activation parameters have been evaluated using Arrhenius and Eyring plots. The oxidation products were isolated and characterized. A mechanism involving the reaction of DP with Mn(III) in the ratelimiting step is suggested. An apparent correlation was noted between the rate of oxidation and the hydrophobicity of these dimers, where increased hyphobicity results in increased rate of oxidation.</p>

					<p>A series of covalently linked bisporphyrins bearing meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and octabromotetraphenylporphyrin (OBTPP) units have been synthesised and characterised. Electrochemical studies on these bisporphyrins showed an anodic shift ($\tilde$ 30–60 mV) of the TPP unit and a cathodic shift ($\tilde$ 40–80 mV) of OBTPP in redox potentials. Further, steady-state fluorescence studies on bisporphyrins indicated dramatic decrease in fluorescence quantum yields of the TPP moiety. Electrochemical redox and fluorescence data seem to suggest the possible existence of intramolecular interactions in these bisporphyrins.</p>

				<title>Molecular orbital studies on the Wagner–Meerwein migration in some acyclic pinacol–pinacolone rearrangements</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0083-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The semi-empirical PM3 SCF-MO method is used to investigate the Wagner–Meerwein migration of various groups during the pinacol–pinacolone rearrangement of some acyclic systems. Pinacol first protonates and dehydrates to form a carbocation that undergoes a 1,2-migration to form a protonated ketone, which then deprotonates to yield the pinacolone product. We study the Wagner–Meerwein migration of hydride, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, phenyl and heterocylic $2-$, $3-$ and $4-$pyridyl groups in various acyclic 1,2-diol (pinacol) systems as they rearrange to pinacolones. This 1,2-migration involves a three-centred moiety in the cationic transition state. The migratory aptitude predicted here follows the order: hydride $$ $t$-butyl $&gt;$ isopropyl $&gt;$ ethyl $&gt;$ methyl $&gt;$ phenyl, which accords well with available experimental data and/or chemical intuition, reflecting also on the ability of the group involved to carry positive charge in the transition state. The structure of the migrating group (whether aliphatic or aromatic) within the transition state also supports the stabilising role of delocalisation of positive charge for reaction feasibility. Geometrical and thermodynamic considerations coincide in assigning the following order to relative ``earliness” of the transition state along the reaction pathway: $t$-butyl $&gt;$ isopropyl $&gt;$ phenyl $&gt;$ methyl $&gt;$ 2-pyridyl $&gt;$ 4-pyridyl.</p>

				<page>0101-0106</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of eleven amino acids by tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) in aqueous acetic acid results in the formation of the corresponding carbonyl compounds and ammonia. The reaction is first order with respect to TBATB. Michaelis–Menten type kinetics is observed with some of the amino acids while others exhibit second-order dependence. It failed to induce polymerization of acrylonitrile. The effect of solvent composition indicate that the rate of reaction increases with increase in the polarity of the medium. Addition of tetrabutylammonium chloride has no effect on the rate of oxidation. Addition of bromide ion causes decrease in the oxidation rate but only to a limiting value. The reaction is susceptible to both polar and steric effects of the substituents. A suitable mechanism has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Large pore aluminophosphate-based molecular sieves like AlPO$_4$-5, MAPO-5, MnAPO-5 and ZAPO-5 were synthesised hydrothermally using triethylamine as a structure directing agent. These materials were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), ${}^{27}$Al and ${}^{31}$P MAS-NMR, ICP-MS, $n$-butylamine- TPD, BET and SEM. The catalytic performance of these materials was tested for isopropylation of benzene with 2-propanol at 250, 300, 350 and 400$^{\circ}$C. The products were cumene, $p$-DIPB ($p$-diisopropylbenzene) and $m$-DIPB ($m$-diisopropylbenzene). MnAPO-5 was found to be more active than the other catalysts. Maximum conversion (20$&#37;$) was noted at 350$^\circ$C over MnAPO-5. The selectivity to DIPB was found to decrease with time on stream but the selectivity to cumene showed an increase after 3 h of time on stream.</p>

The rate of polymerization is proportional to [MBA] and [AH$_2$].

				<abstract>
					<p>Equilibrium constants are determined for the reaction of ethylester and methyl ester (aquo) cobaloximes with histamine, histidine, glycine and ethyl glycine ester as a function of pH at 25$^\circ$C, using spectrophotometric technique. The functional dependence of pKa on the substitution rate of H$_2$O varies with the p$K_a$ of the incoming ligand, establishing the existence of nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. This data is interpreted with the help of kinetic data where dissociation kinetic reactions were also studied as a function of pH. Binding and kinetic data were correlated based on the basicity, steric hindrance of the entering ligand and HSAB principle. To compare the rate constants of the entering ligands pH-independent second-order rate constants were calculated. The effect of incoming ligand on Co–C bond is studied using molecular mechanics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Low-temperature stoichiometric Schiff base reaction in air in 3 : 1 mole ratio between benzaldehyde and triethylenetetramine (trien) in methanol yields a novel tetraaza m-bis(bidentate) acyclic ligand L. It was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, EI mass and NMR (${}^1$H and ${}^{13}$C) spectra. The formation of a five-membered imidazolidine ring from the ethylenediamine backbone as a spacer-cumbridging unit gives rise to a new type of imidazolidine-bridged ligand. A geometric optimisation was made of the synthesized ligand and its complexes by the method of molecular mechanics (MM2) method in order to establish the stable conformations. This hitherto unknown tetraaza acyclic ligand affords new cationic dicopper(I/I) and dicopper(II/II) complexes in good yield. Dicopper(II/II) complex displays weak $d–d$ transition bands in the visible region, while dicopper(I/I) complex displays strong MLCT band in the same region. Both the dinuclear complexes are of non-intimate nature and show interesting solution electrochemical behaviour. EPR spectral study of $\mu$-\textit{bis}(imidazolidino) bridged dicopper(II/II) complex also supports the non-communicative nature of the two copper centres within the same molecule.</p>

				<title>Proline-catalysed asymmetric ketol cyclizations: The template mechanism revisited</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0159-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A modified template mechanism based on modelling studies of energy minimised complexes is presented for the asymmetric proline-catalysed cyclization of triketones {\bf 1}, {\bf 2} and {\bf 3} to the $2S$, $3S$-ketols {\bf 1a}, {\bf 2a} and {\bf 3a} respectively. The template model involves a three-point contact as favoured in enzyme–substrate interactions. Our minimisation studies are in agreement with the divergent behaviour of the $6,5-$, $6,6-$ and $6,7-$bicyclic systems. They support the high 93.4$&#37;$ ee observed with the 6,5-bicyclic ketol and the lower 73$&#37;$ \textit{ee} found with the 6,6-bicyclic ketol. The calculations also explain the lack of asymmetric induction with the 6,7-bicyclic system.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0169-0174</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In an effort to design agents that could solubilize silica in water, under ambient conditions and pH, as takes place in nature, novel zwitterionic, penta-oxo-coordinated silicon compounds with siliconate cores have been prepared from 4-substituted pyridine N-oxides (H, OMe, morpholino, NO$_2$) as donor ligands, their structures established by 1H, 13C and MS, and the coordination number of silicon, by ${}^{29}$Si NMR. The formation of complexes from pyridine N-oxides is noteworthy since they arise from interaction with a weakly nucleophilic oxygen centre. The ability of the pyridine N-oxides to enhance the solubilization of silica in water has been experimentally demonstrated. Possible rationalization of this observation on the basis of O$\rightarrow$Si coordination via the oxygen atom of pyridine N-oxide is suggested.</p>

				<title>Sugar amino acids and related molecules: Some recent developments</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0187-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To meet the growing demands for the development of new molecular entities for discovering new drugs and materials, organic chemists have started working on many new concepts that can help to assimilate knowledge-based structural diversities more efficiently than ever before. Emulating the basic principles followed by Nature to build its vast repertoire of biomolecules, organic chemists are developing many novel multifunctional building blocks and using them to create `nature-like’ and yet unnatural organic molecules. Sugar amino acids constitute an important class of such polyfunctional scaffolds where the carboxyl, amino and hydroxyl termini provide an excellent opportunity to organic chemists to create structural diversities akin to Nature’s molecular arsenal. In recent years, sugar amino acids have been used extensively in the area of peptidomimetic studies. Advances made in the area of combinatorial chemistry can provide the necessary technological support for rapid compilations of sugar amino acidbased libraries exploiting the diversities of their carbohydrate frameworks and well-developed solidphase peptide synthesis methods. This perspective article chronicles some of the recent applications of various sugar amino acids, furan amino acids, pyrrole amino acids etc. and many other related building blocks in wide-ranging peptidomimetic studies.</p>

The monomeric and non-electrolytic nature of the complexes is evidenced by their magnetic susceptibility and low conductance data. The electrochemical property of the ligand and its complexes in acetonitrile solution was studied by cyclic voltammetry. The X-band ESR spectra of the Cu(II) complex in DMSO at 300 and 77 K were recorded and their salient features are reported.</p>

				<title>Basicities of some 9-substituted acridine-4-carboxamides: A density functional theory (DFT) calculation</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0235-0241</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Acid–base properties of drugs are important in understanding the behaviour of these compounds under physiological condition. In order to understand such behaviour the proton affinities of acridine 4-carboxamides with substitution (R) at the 9-position are theoretically studied, and considered for the basic sites of both the heterocyclic ring as well as side chain nitrogens. In 9-amino acridine 4-carboxamide, the –NH2 group is observed to be an additional basic site. The heterocyclic nitrogen of substituted carboxamides (R = –NH$_2$, –O-methyl, –O-ethyl, and –O-phenyl) is more basic than the side chain nitrogen, however, side chain nitrogen corresponds to more basic site for some carboxamides (R = –OH and –Cl) and the –NH2 group represents the least basic site of 9-amino acridine 4-carboxamide. In addition to presenting the basicities of these drugs an indication of another hydrogen-bond between heterocyclic ring N and carboxamide chain O is observed. The difference of basicities with substituents at 9-position are very narrow and carboxamides with substituents at 9-position are found to be suitable for studying intramolecular H-bonds between the heterocyclic N and carboxamide O. The resultant stabilization of a configuration due to such H-bonding is determined.</p>

					<p>The reaction of Ru(RL$^{1}$)(PPh$_3$)$_2$(CO)Cl, {\bf 1}, with quinolin-8-ol (HQ) has afforded complexes of the type [Ru(RL$^2$)(PPh$_3$)$_2$(CO)(Q)], {\bf 3}, in excellent yield (RL$^1$ is C$_6$H$_2$O-2-CHNHC$_6$H$_4$R($p$)-3-Me-5, RL$^2$ is C$_6$H$_2$OH-2-CHNC$_6$H$_4$R($p$)-3-Me-5 and R is Me, OMe, Cl). In this process, quinolin-8-olato (Q) undergoes five-membered chelation, the iminium-phenolato function tautomerizing to the imine-phenol function. In dichloromethane solution, {\bf 3} displays a quasireversible {\bf 3}$^+$/{\bf 3} couple near 0×50 V vs SCE ({\bf 3}$^+$ is the ruthenium (III) analogue of {\bf 3}). Coulometrically generated solutions of {\bf 3}$^+$ display a strong absorption near 395 nm associated with a shoulder near 475 nm and rhombic EPR spectra with $g$ values near 2$\cdot$55, 2$\cdot$13, 1$\cdot$89. Solutions of {\bf 3} absorb near 415 nm and emit near 510 nm at 298 K and 585 nm at 77 K. The fluorescence is believed to originate from the ${}^3$MLCT state.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The complexes [MoX$_4$]$^{2–}$ (M = Mo; X = O or S) exist as the monomeric tetrahedral species in aqueous alkaline solutions. Acidification of tetraoxomolybdate results in the condensation of the tetrahedral units via a series of polyoxomolybdates leading to the ultimate formation of the trioxide MoO3. Heptamolybdate [Mo$_7$O$_{24}$]$^{6–}$ is the first major polyanion of the acidification reaction. In contrast, acidification of tetrathiomolybdates leads to the formation of amorphous molybdenum trisulphide via a dinuclear Mo(V) complex. The formation of the dinuclear Mo(V) complex precludes the formation of any higher nuclearity Mo(VI)-S complexes in aqueous solution. Thus it is shown that the all-sulphur analogue of heptamolybdate [Mo$_7$S$_{2$}$]$^{6–}$ does not exist in alkaline medium and also cannot be isolated from aqueous acidic medium.</p>

The variations of relative energies and stabilities of the core-modified analogues were compared with parent porphyrin {\bf 1} and the corresponding oxa- and thia-analogues. The trends in relative energies are not significantly changed while going from parent system to oxa- and thia-core-modified porphyrins in case of both syn and anti tautomers. Isomers of types [2$\cdot$2$\cdot$0$\cdot$0], [3$\cdot$0$\cdot$1$\cdot$0], [3$\cdot$1$\cdot$0$\cdot$0], and [4$\cdot$0$\cdot$0$\cdot$0] are destabilized due to the absence of methine bridge, which results in angle strain for tetrapyrroles.

				<title>Phase transfer of platinum nanoparticles from aqueous to organic solutions using fatty amine molecules</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0293-0300</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this report we demonstrate a simple process based on amine chemistry for the phase transfer of platinum nanoparticles from an aqueous to an organic solution. The phase transfer was accomplished by vigorous shaking of a biphasic mixture of platinum nanoparticles synthesised in an aqueous medium and octadecylamine (ODA) in hexane. During shaking of the biphasic mixture, the aqueous platinum nanoparticles complex via either coordination bond formation or weak covalent interaction with the ODA molecules present in the organic phase. This process renders the nanoparticles sufficiently hydrophobic and dispersible in the organic phase. The ODA-stabilised platinum nanoparticles could be separated out from hexane in the form of a powder that is readily redispersible in weakly polar and nonpolar organic solvents. The ODA-capped platinum nanoparticles show high catalytic activity in hydrogenation reactions and this is demonstrated in the efficient conversion of styrene to ethyl benzene. The nature of binding of the ODA molecules to the platinum nanoparticles surface was characterised by thermogravimetry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).</p>

				<page>0333-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of lactic acid, mandelic acid and ten monosubstituted mandelic acids by hexamethylenetetramine-bromine (HABR) in glacial acetic acid, leads to the formation of the corresponding oxoacid. The reaction is first order with respect to each of the hydroxy acids and HABR. It is proposed that HABR itself is the reactive oxidizing species. The oxidation of $\alpha$-deuteriomandelic acid exhibits the presence of a substantial kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 5 \cdot 91$ at 298 K). The rates of oxidation of the substituted mandelic acids show excellent correlation with Brown’s $\sigma^+$ values. The reaction constants are negative. The oxidation exhibits an extensive cross conjugation between the electron-donating substituent and the reaction centre in the transition state. A mechanism involving transfer of a hydride ion from the acid to the oxidant is postulated.</p>

				<title>NMR of unfolded proteins</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0003-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the post-genomic era, as more and more genome sequences are becoming known and hectic efforts are underway to decode the information content in them, it is becoming increasingly evident that flexibility in proteins plays a crucial role in many of the biological functions. Many proteins have intrinsic disorder either wholly or in specific regions. It appears that this disorder may be important for regulatory functions of the proteins, on the one hand, and may help in directing the folding process to reach the compact native state, on the other. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has over the last two decades emerged as the sole, most powerful technique to help characterize these disordered protein systems. In this review, we first discuss the significance of disorder in proteins and then describe the recent developments in NMR methods for their characterization. A brief description of the results obtained on several disordered proteins is presented at the end.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of ruthenium (III) catalyzed oxidation of atenolol by permanganate in alkaline medium at constant ionic strength of 0$\cdot$30 mol dm$^3$ has been studied spectrophotometrically using a rapid kinetic accessory. Reaction between permanganate and atenolol in alkaline medium exhibits 1 : 8 stoichiometry (atenolol : KMnO$_4$). The reaction shows first-order dependence on [permanganate] and [ruthenium (III)] and apparently less than unit order on both atenolol and alkali concentrations. Reaction rate decreases with increase in ionic strength and increases with decreasing dielectric constant of the medium. Initial addition of reaction products does not affect the rate significantly. A mechanism involving the formation of a complex between catalyst and substrate has been proposed. The active species of ruthenium (III) is understood as [Ru(H$_2$O)$_5$OH]$^{2+}$. The reaction constants involved in the different steps of mechanism are calculated. Activation parameters with respect to the slow step of the mechanism are computed and discussed and thermodynamic quantities are also calculated.</p>

					<p>Silver nanosized crystallites have been synthesized in aqueous and polyols viz., ethylene glycol and glycerol, using a microwave technique. Dispersions of colloidal silver have been prepared by the reduction of silver nitrate both in the presence and absence of stabilizer poly(vinylpyrolidone) (PVP). It was observed that PVP is capable of complexing and stabilizing Ag nanoparticles formed through the reduction of Ag$^+$ ions in water and ethylene glycol. In the case of ethylene glycol, it has been shown that the use of PVP leads to particles with a high degree of stability. The colloids are stable in glycerol for months even in the absence of stabilizer.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Octamethoxyporphyrin containing multiple-donor substituents has been functionalized for the first time. A large number of its mono-meso-substituted derivatives with substituents such as nitro, amino, N-methylamino, formyl, hydroxymethyl, oxime, cyano and carboxy functional groups have been synthesized and characterized. They form a new class of nonasubstituted porphyrins. Crystallographic studies on the cyano derivative show that the –C N group is in conjugation with the prophyrin $\pi$-system. The calculated optical transition energies and the electron densities on the imino nitrogens of the synthesised porphyrins using AMI calculations correlate well with the experimentally observed data. Mesosubstituted porphyrins are found to be essentially planar.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The sulphhydryl environment in various mixed-metal hybrid hemoglobins, viz. $\alpha_2$(Cu)-$\beta_2(FeCO)$, $\alpha_2$(FeCO)-$\beta_2$(Cu), $\alpha_2$(Cu)-$\beta_2$(Ni), $\alpha_2$(Ni)-$\beta_2$(Cu), was studied by reacting them with the sulphhydryl reagent, 4,4'-dithiodipyridine (4-PDS). The reactivity was compared with that of HbCO, NiHb and CuHb. It is found that there exists a correlation between conformational change and metal ion environment, not only at the extreme R and T states but also the intermediate conformations. EPR examinations of these hybrids show that both in 4R$ \textit{state}-[Cu(II)-Fe(II)] and $T$ \textit{state}-[Cu(II)-Ni(II)] hybrids at neutral pH and in the absence of IHP, CuPPIX, irrespective of the subunit in which it is present, has a mixed-metal ion environment: Species 1, a five-coordinated Cu$^{2+}$ complex with strong proximal histidine bond and species 2, a four-coordinated complex without any covalent linkage with N$\varepsilon$ F8-histidine.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, photophysical and metal ion signalling behaviour of mono- and di-azacrown derivatives of 4-aminophthalimide</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0105-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, photophysical behaviour and metal ion signalling ability of 3-component systems, {\bf I} and {\bf II}, comprising a 4-aminophthalimido moiety as \textit{fluorophore}, a dimethylene \textit{spacer} and two different azacrown \textit{receptors}, are reported. The fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes of both the systems have been found to be significantly lower than that of the parent fluorophore indicating the occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the terminal moieties. PET is found to be more efficient in {\bf II}, presumably due to the presence of more than one electron-donating centre in the receptor moiety. Fluorescence decay behaviour of the systems suggests a \textit{through-space} nature of PET. The systems exhibit \textit{off–on} fluorescence signalling in the aprotic media in the presence of several metal ions, some of which are well known for their fluorescence quenching abilities. Diazacrown derivative, {\bf II}, appears to be a somewhat better signalling system than the monoazacrown derivative, {\bf I}.</p>

				<title>Fixation of CO$_2$ in air: Synthesis and crystal structure of a $\mu_3$-CO$_3$-bridged tricopper(II) compound</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0111-0116</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A novel trinuclear copper(II) compound [&#123;(L$^3$)Cu(OClO$_3$)&#125;$_3$($\mu_3$-OCO$_2$)][ClO$_4$] has been synthesised using an N-tridentate symmetrical pyridylalkylamine ligand, N-methyl-N,N-\textit{bis}(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (L$^3$). The structure of the complex has been determined by X-ray crystallography; it is found to crystallise in the hexagonal space group $P6_3/_m$ with $a = 13 \cdot 936$(2), $b = 13 \cdot 936$(2), $c = 14 \cdot 895$(3) Å, $\alpha = \beta = 90$^\circ$, $\gamma = 120^\circ$. The complex possesses a $\bar{6}$ – symmetry axis passing through the carbon atom of the triply bridging carbonate ion, with the three symmetry related copper ions connected to one another through the oxygen atoms from the bridging carbonato group, giving an equilateral triangular array of copper centres. Each copper ion has distorted square pyramidal environment with the basal plane formed by three nitrogen atoms of the ligand L$^3$ and the oxygen atom of the bridging carbonato group. The apical position at each copper is provided by the weak oxygen coordination from the perchlorate ion.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, characterisation of few N-substituted 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives and their copper(II) complexes</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>A few 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives with phenyl ({\bf 1}), benzyl ({\bf 2}), 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl ethyl ({\bf 3}), 4-pyridyl ({\bf 4}), 2-hydroxy ethyl ({\bf 5}), 4-pyridylmethyl ({\bf 6}) groups attached to the nitrogen atom are synthesized and characterized. Cyclic voltammograms of all these compounds show one-electron reversible redox cycle ( $–1 \cdot 24$ V to $–1\cdot18$ V) due to formation of anion radicals. However, in the case of ({\bf 5}), quenching of this redox process occurs when polyhydroxy-aromatic compounds such as 1,3-dihydroxy benzene and 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene are added. Copper complexes, namely \textit{bis}-&#123;N-(4-pyridylmethyl)1,8-naphthalimide&#125;copper (II) perchlorate ({\bf 8}), \textit{bis}-&#123;N-(4-pyridylmethyl)1,8-naphthalimide&#125;copper (II) perchlorate ({\bf 9}) and \textit{bis}-&#123;N-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalimide&#125; copper (II) perchlorate ({\bf 10}) are synthesized and characterised. The complexes ({\bf 8}) and ({\bf 9}) show reversible redox couple of the ligand without any significant interaction with the redox active copper (II) centre.</p>

				<title>Effect of copper–sulphur bond on the DNA photo-cleavage activity of 2-(methylthio)ethylpyridine-2-carbaldimine copper(II) complexes</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The binding and photo-induced DNA cleavage activity of a binary complex [CuL$_2$](ClO$_4$)$_2$ ({\bf 1}) and the \textit{in situ} generated ternary complexes [CuLB](ClO$_4$)$_2$ from {\bf 1} (B: 1,10-phenanthroline, phen, {\bf 2}; dipyrido[3,2-$d$: 2',3'-$f$]quinoxaline, dpq, {\bf 3}) are studied, where L is a N$_2$S-donor tridentate Schiff base 2-(methylthio)ethylpyridine-2-carbaldimine. Complex {\bf 1}, structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction study, has six-coordinate meridional geometry showing CuN$_4$S$_2$ coordination. The Cu–N bond lengths are in the range of $1 \cdot 968$(3) to $2 \cdot 158$(4) Å. The Cu–S bond lengths of $2 \cdot 599$(2) and $2 \cdot 705$(2) Å are significantly long indicating weak covalent interaction between copper and sulphur atoms. The thiomethyl groups are \textit{cis} to each other giving S–Cu–S angle of 75$\cdot$82(5)$^\circ$. The Cu–N(pyridyl) bond distances are longer than the Cu–N(imine) bonds. The complexes are redox active and display a quasi-reversible cyclic voltammetric response assignable to the Cu(II)/Cu(I) couple near 0$\cdot$0 V vs SCE in DMF-Tris buffer (1 : 4 $v/v$) using 0$\cdot$1 M KCl as supporting electrolyte. Electronic spectra of the complexes show a $d–d$ band in the range 630 to 700 nm in DMF along with higher energy charge transfer bands. While complex {\bf 1} is a poor binder to DNA, the ternary complexes show good DNA binding propensity. The photo-nuclease activity of {\bf 1–3} is studied using UV and visible wavelengths. The DNA cleavage activity at 365 nm follows the order: {\bf 3} $&gt;$ {\bf 2} $&gt;$ {\bf 1}. The cleavage reaction involves the formation of singlet oxygen as the reactive species in a type-II process.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence-enhancement with different ionic inputs in a cryptand-based multi-receptor signalling system</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0145-0151</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two molecules of a laterally non-symmetric aza cryptand have been attached to 9,10-dimethylanthracene to obtain a multi-receptor fluorescent signalling system in the ``receptor–spacer–fluorophore– spacer–receptor” format. In the absence of a metal ion, weak fluorescence is observed upon excitation of the anthryl group owing to efficient photo-induced electron transfer (PET) of the lone pair of N attached to the anthryl group. However, when a metal salt is added, the lone pair is engaged, thus in blocking of the PET and leading to recovery of fluorescence to different extents depending upon the nature of the metal ion.</p>

					<p>Mixed-ligand complexes of the type [Ru(N-N)$_2$(dzdf)]Cl$_2$, where N–N is 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 9-diazo-4,5-diazafluorene (dzdf), have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, UV–Vis, IR and NMR spectroscopy.

				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence properties of meso-tetrafurylporphyrins with N$_4$, N$_3$S and N$_2$S$_2$ porphyrin cores are studied by both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques and compared with the corresponding meso-tetraarylporphyrins. The study shows that the replacement of six-membered aryl groups with five-membered furyl groups at meso-positions alter the fluorescence properties considerably, as reflected in the large red shifts and broadening of fluorescence bands with reduction in quantum yields and singlet excited-state lifetimes. However, zinc(II) derivatives of meso-tetrafurylporphyrin and mesotetraarylporphyrin did not show significant differences in their emission properties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reaction of N-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)pyrrole-2-aldimine (H$_2$L) with [M(PPh$_3$)$_3$Cl] (M = Rh, Ir) affords complexes of type [M(PPh$_3$)$_2$(L)Cl]. Structures of both complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In both complexes, the N-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)pyrrole-2-aldimine ligand is coordinated to the metal centre, via dissociation of the acidic protons, as a dianionic tridentate N,N,O-donor. The M(L)Cl fragment constitutes an equatorial plane with the metal at the centre and the two PPh3 ligands occupying axial positions. The complexes are diamagnetic (low-spin $d^6$, $S = 0$) and show intense MLCT transitions in the visible region. Cyclic voltammetry of the [M(PPh$_3$)$_2$(L)Cl] complexes shows reversible M(III)–M(IV) oxidation near $0\cdot 5$ V vs SCE and quasi-reversible ligand-centred oxidative response near 1$\cdot$0 V vs SCE.</p>

				<title>Mixed-ligand copper(II) complexes of dipicolylamine and 1,10-phenanthrolines: The role of diimines in the interaction of the complexes with DNA</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0179-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mixed-ligand copper(II) complexes of the type [Cu(dipica)(diimine)](ClO$_4$)$_2$, where dipica is di(2-picolyl)amine and diimine is 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (5,6-dmp), 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (2,9-dmp) or dipyridoquinoxaline (dpq), have been isolated and characterized by analytical and spectral methods. The copper(II) complexes exhibit a broad band in the visible region around 675 nm and axial EPR spectra in acetonitrile glass (77 K) with $g_{||}$ and $A_{||}$ values of $~2 \cdot 22$ and $185 \times 10^{–4}$ cm$^{–1}$ respectively, suggesting the presence of a square-based coordination geometry for the CuN$_5$ chromophore involving strong axial interaction. The interaction of the complexes with CT DNA has been studied using absorption, emission and circular dichroic spectral methods and viscosity measurements. Absorption spectral titrations reveal that the intrinsic DNA binding affinities are dependent upon the nature of the diimine ligand: dpq &gt; 5,6-dmp &gt; phen &gt; 2,9-dmp. This suggests the involvement of the diimine rather than the dipica `face’ of the complexes in DNA binding. An intercalative mode of DNA interaction, which involves the insertion of dpq and to a lesser extent the phen ring of the complexes in between the DNA base pairs, is proposed. However, interestingly, the 5,6-dmp complex is involved in hydrophobic interaction of the 5,6-dmp ring in the grooves of DNA. The large enhancement in the relative viscosity of DNA on binding to the dpq and 5,6-dmp complexes supports the proposed DNA binding modes. Further, remarkably, the 5,6-dmp complex is selective in exhibiting a positive-induced CD band on binding to DNA suggesting the transition of the B form of CT DNA to A-like conformation. The variation in relative emission intensities of DNA-bound ethidium bromide observed upon treatment with the complexes parallels the trend in DNA binding affinities.</p>

				<title>Iron(III) porphyrin-catalysed oxidation reactions by $m$-chloroperbenzoic acid: Nature of reactive intermediates</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0187-0191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of $m$-chloroperbenzoic ($m$-CPBA) acid with meso-\textit{tetrakis} (pentafluorophenyl) porphynatoiron(III) chloride (F$_{20}TPPF$_e$(III)Cl ) has been studied in dichloromethane and acetonitrile medium at $25 \pm 1^\circ$C. The reactive intermediates formed in this reaction have been quantitatively trapped by 2,4,6-tri $t$-butylphenol (TTBP) in both the solvents. It has been observed that the kinetic plots of the formation of TTBP$^\bigdot$ radical in dichloromethane are all multiexponential, supporting the formation of more than one reactive intermediate in this solvent. In acetonitrile solvent the formation of TTBP$^\bigdot$ radical was however observed to be distinctly single exponential. Different kinds of reactive intermediates are proposed in these two solvents.</p>

				<title>Porphyrin–anthraquinone dyads: Synthesis, spectroscopy and photochemistry</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0193-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Free-base (H$_2$L$^2$), copper(II) (CuL$^2$) and zinc(II) (ZnL$^2$) derivatives of a porphyrin–anthraquinone conjugate with an azomethine group separating the two photoactive subunits have been synthesized and characterized by mass (FAB), IR, UV–visible, 1H NMR and ESR spectroscopic techniques and also by cyclic and differential pulse voltammetric methods. Analysis of the data reveals that the spectral and electrochemical properties of the individual chromophoric entities are retained and that there is no specific $\pi$–$\pi$ interaction between the porphyrin and anthraquinone subunits. H$_2$L$^2$ and ZnL$^2$ are shown to exhibit substantial quenching (88–97&#37;) of the porphyrin fluorescence compared to their corresponding monomeric analogues. An intramolecular electron-transfer mechanism is proposed for the substantial decrease in fluorescence in both derivatives. The fluorescence decays of porphyrin–anthraquinone conjugates are fit to 2/3 exponentials and indicate that multiple orientations of the porphyrin and anthraquinone groups contribute to the electron-transfer event. These results are in good agreement with steady-state fluorescence results. From the time-resolved fluorescence data, the electron-transfer rate constants are calculated, indicating $k_{\text{ET}}$ values in the range of $1\cdot 1 \times 10^9$ to $9 \cdot 9 \times  10^{10}$ s$^{–1}$ that are dependent upon the solvent.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0207-0218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Underpotential deposition (UPD) of metals is analysed from the perspective of phenomenological and statistical thermodynamic considerations; the parameters influencing the UPD shift have been quantitatively indicated using a general formalism. The manner in which the macroscopic properties pertaining to the depositing ions and solvent dipoles and the nature of the metallic substrate influence the UPD process are highlighted; earlier correlations of the UPD shift with the work function differences are rationalised. Anion-induced phase transitions which manifest as sharp peaks in experimental cyclic voltammograms are discussed using statistical thermodynamic models.</p>

					<p>Two new compounds, [(C$_4$N$_2$H$_{12}$)$_3$][P$_2$Mo$_5$O$_{23}$]$\cdot$H$_2$O, {\bf I}, and [(C$_3$N$_2$H$_{12}$)$_3$][P$_2$Mo$_5$O$_{23}$]$\cdot$4H$_2$O, {\bf II}, have been prepared employing hydrothermal methods in the presence of aliphatic organic amine molecules. Both the compounds possess the same polyoxoanion, pentamolybdatobisphosphate, (P$_2$Mo$_5$O$_{23}$)$^{6–}$. The anions consist of a ring of five MoO$_6$ distorted octahedra with four edge connections and one corner connection. The phosphate groups cap the pentamolybdate ring anion on either side. The anion is stabilized by strong hydrogen bonds involving the hydrogen atoms of the amine molecules and the oxygen atoms of the polyoxoanion and water molecules.

					<p>Densities ($\rho$) of glycine, L-alanine, and L-valine in aqueous solutions of MgCl$_2 \dot$6H$_2$O ($0 \cdot 1–0 \cdot 8$ mol kg$^{–1}$) have been measured at $288 \cdot 15$, and $308 \cdot 15$ K. Apparent molar volumes ($V_\phi$), and limiting partial molar volumes ($V^0_{\phi}$) of each amino acid have been calculated. These data were combined with the earlier reported $V^0_{\phi}$ values of glycine, L-alanine, and L-valine in aqueous MgCl$_2\cdot 6$H$_2$O solutions at $298 \cdot 15$ K in order to describe the temperature dependence behaviour of partial molar quantities. Group contributions to partial molar volumes have been determined for the amino acids. The trends of transfer volumes ($\Delta V^0_{\phi}$) have been interpreted in terms of solute–cosolute interactions on the basis of a cosphere overlap model. Pair and triplet interaction coefficients have also been calculated from transfer parameters.</p>

					<p>Viscosities and densities of sucrose in aqueous alkali metal halide solutions of different concentrations in the temperature range $293 \cdot 15$ to $313 \cdot 15$ K have been measured. Partial molar volumes at infinite dilution ($V_2^0$) of sucrose determined from apparent molar volume ($\phi_v$) have been utilized to estimate partial molar volumes of transfer ($V^0_{2,tr}$) for sucrose from water to alkali metal halide solutions. The viscosity data of alkali metal halides in purely aqueous solutions and in the presence of sucrose at different temperatures ($293\cdot 15$, $303 \cdot 15$ and $313 \cdot 5$ K) have been analysed by the Jones–Dole equation. The nature and magnitude of solute–solvent and solute–solute interactions have been discussed in terms of the values of limiting apparent molar volume ($\phi^0_v$), slope ($S_v$) and coefficients of the Jones–Dole equation. The structuremaking and structure-breaking capacities of alkali metal halides in pure aqueous solutions and in the presence of sucrose have been ascertained from temperature dependence of $\phi^0_v$.</p>

The role of selenocysteine moiety in natural mammalian enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), iodothyronine deiodinase (ID) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is highlighted and the effect of other amino acid residues located in close proximity to selenocysteine is described. It is evident from various studies that two amino acid residues, tryptophan and glutamine, appear in identical positions in all known members of the GPx family. According to the three-dimensional structure established for bovine GPx, these residues could constitute a catalytic triad in which the selenol group of the selenocysteine is both stabilized and activated by hydrogen bonding with the imino group of the tryptophan (Trp) residue and with the amido group of the glutamine (Gln) residue. The ID enzymes, on the other hand, do not possess any Trp or Gln residues in close proximity to selenium, but contain several histidine residues, which may play important roles in the catalysis. The TrxR enzymes also possess some basic histidines, but the most important amino acid residues are the cysteines which constitute the internal cofactor systems along with the catalytically active selenocysteine. The catalytic activity and substrate specificity of all three selenoenzymes are described. The reactivity of selenocysteine residues in selenoenzymes towards metal-based drugs such as goldthioglucose is also described.</p>

				<title>Electrochemical determination of hydrogen peroxide using $o$-dianisidine as substrate and hemoglobin as catalyst</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0317-0322</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new electrochemical method for the determination of microamounts of hydrogen peroxide utilizing $o$-dianisidine (ODA) as substrate and hemoglobin (Hb) as catalyst is described in this paper. Hb can be used as mimetic peroxidase and it can catalyse the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with the subsequent oxidation of ODA. The oxidative reaction product is an azo compound, which is an electroactive substance and has a sensitive second-order derivative polarographic reductive peak at the potential of $–0 \cdot 58$ V (vs. SCE) in pH $8\cdot0$ Britton–Robinson (B–R) buffer solution. The conditions of Hb-catalytic reaction and polarographic detection of the reaction product were carefully studied. By using this polarographic peak and under optimal conditions, the calibration curve for the H$_2$O$_2$ was constructed in the linear range of $2 \cdot 0 \times 10$^{–7} \tilde 1 \cdot 0  \times 10^{–4}$ mol/l with the detection limit of $5 \cdot 0 \times 10^{–8}$ mol/l. This method can also be used to the determination of Hb content in the range of $2 \cdot 0  \times 10^{–9} \tilde 3 \cdot 0  \times 10^{–7}$ mol/l with a detection limit of $1 \cdot 0 \times 10^{–9}$ mol/l. The proposed method was further applied to the determination of the content of H$_2$O$_2$ in fresh rainwater with satisfactory results. The catalytic reaction mechanism and the electrode reductive process of the reaction product were carefully studied.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of glycine by iron(III)–1,10-phenanthroline complex has been studied in perchloric acid medium. The reaction is first order with respect to iron(III) and glycine. An increase in (phenanthroline) increases the rate, while increase in [H$^+$] decreases the rate. Hence it can be inferred that the reactive species of the substrate is the zwitterionic form and that of the oxidant is [Fe(phen)$_2$(H$_2$O)$_2$]$^{3+}$. The proposed mechanism leads to the rate law as elucidated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chloramphenicol (CAP) is an antibiotic drug having a wide spectrum of activity. The kinetics of oxidation of chloramphenicol by 1-chlorobenzotriazole (CBT) in HClO$_4$ medium over the temperature range 293–323 K has been investigated. The reaction exhibits first-order kinetics with respect to [CBT]$_o$ and zero-order with respect to [CAP]$_o$. The fractional-order dependence of rate on [H$^+$] suggests complex formation between CBT and H$^+$. It fails to induce polymerization of acrylonitrile under the experimental conditions employed. Activation parameters are evaluated. The observed solvent isotope effect indicates the absence of hydride transfer during oxidation. Effects of dielectric constant and ionic strength of the medium on the reaction rate have been studied. Oxidation products are identified. A suitable reaction scheme is proposed and an appropriate rate law is deduced to account for the observed kinetic data.</p>

					<p>A comparative study of the electro-oxidation of ethanol and 2-propanol was carried out on carbon-supported platinum particles. Cyclic voltammetry, steady state polarisation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to investigate the oxidation reactions. A difference in the mechanistic behaviour of the oxidation of ethanol and 2-propanol on Pt was observed, thereby highlighting the fact that the molecular structure of the alcohol has great influence on its electroreactivity. The study emphasizes the fact that 2-propanol is a promising fuel candidate for a direct alcohol fuel cell.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of protection of adenosine from sulphate radical anion and repair of adenosine radicals by caffeic acid in aqueous solution</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0345-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The photooxidation of adenosine in presence of peroxydisulphate (PDS) has been studied by spectrophotometrically measuring the absorbance of adenosine at 260 nm. The rates of oxidation of adenosine by sulphate radical anion have been determined in the presence of different concentrations of caffeic acid. Increase in [caffeic acid] is found to decrease the rate of oxidation of adenosine suggesting that caffeic acid acts as an efficient scavenger of $SO_4^{\bitdot–}$ and protects adenosine from it. Sulphate radical anion competes for adenosine as well as for caffeic acid. The quantum yields of photooxidation of adenosine have been calculated from the rates of oxidation of adenosine and the light intensity absorbed by PDS at 254 nm, the wavelength at which PDS is activated to sulphate radical anion. From the results of experimentally determined quantum yields ($\phi_{\text{exptl}}$) and the quantum yields calculated ($\phi_{\text{cal}}$) assuming caffeic acid acting only as a scavenger of $SO_4^{\bigdot–}$ show that $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values are lower than $\phi_{\text{cal}}$ values. The $f'$ values, which are experimentally found quantum yield values at each caffeic acid concentration and corrected for $SO_4^{\bigdot–}$ scavenging by caffeic acid, are also found to be greater than $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values. These observations suggest that the transient adenosine radicals are repaired by caffeic acid in addition to scavenging of sulphate radical anions.</p>

The data have been evaluated using the Jones–Dole equation and the obtained parameters have been interpreted in terms of solute–solute and solute–solvent interactions. The activation parameters of viscous flow have been obtained which depicts the mechanism of viscous flow.

				<title>DFT reactivity indices in confined many-electron atoms</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0379-0386</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The density functional descriptors of chemical reactivity given by electronegativity, global hardness and softness are reported for a representative set of spherically confined atoms of IA, IIA, VA and VIIIA series in the periodic table. The atomic electrons are confined within the impenetrable spherical cavity defined by a given radius of confinement satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition such that the electron density vanishes at the radius of confinement. With this boundary condition the non-relativistic spin-polarized Kohn–Sham equations were solved. The electronegativity in a confined atom is found to decrease as the radius of confinement is reduced suggesting that relative to the free state the atom loses its capacity to attract electrons under confined conditions. While the global hardness of a confined atom increases as the radius of confinement decreases, due to the accompanying orbital energy level crossing, it does not increase infinitely. At a certain confinement radius, the atomic global hardness is even reduced due to such crossover. General trends of the atomic softness parameter under spherically confined conditions are reported and discussed.</p>

					<p>Both electron propagator theory and density-functional theory provide conceptually useful information about chemical reactivity and, most especially, charge transfer. This paper elucidates thequalitative and quantitative links between the two theories, with emphasis on how the reactivity indicators of conceptual density-functional theory can be derived from electron propagator theory. Electron propagator theory could be used to compute reactivity indices with high accuracy at reasonable computational cost.</p>

				<title>A density functional theory-based chemical potential equalisation approach to molecular polarizability</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0401-0409</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electron density changes in molecular systems in the presence of external electric fields are modeled for simplicity in terms of the induced charges and dipole moments at the individual atomic sites. A chemical potential equalisation scheme is proposed for the calculation of these quantities and hence the dipole polarizability within the framework of density functional theory based linear response theory. The resulting polarizability is expressed in terms of the contributions from individual atoms in the molecule. A few illustrative numerical calculations are shown to predict the molecular polarizabilities in good agreement with available results. The usefulness of the approach to the calculation of intermolecular interaction needed for computer simulation is highlighted.</p>

				<title>Relation between the Fukui function and the Coulomb hole</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0411-0418</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By using a coarse-grain representation of the molecular electronic density, we demonstrate that the value of the condensed Fukui function at an atomic site is directly related to the polarization charge (Coulomb hole) induced by a test electron removed (or added) from (at) the atom. The link between the formation of an electron-hole pair and the condensed Fukui function provides insights on the possible negativity of the Fukui function which is interpreted in terms of two phenomena: overscreening and overstrengthening.</p>

				<title>Condensation of the highest occupied molecular orbital within the electron localization function domains</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0419-0424</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Use of regions of space defined by topological analysis of electron localization function (ELF) as reactivity descriptors is explored. By starting from the fact that the ELF presents high values in the regions where it is most probable to find an electron pair and that the square of the HOMO is a good measure of the reactivity of a molecule, it is proposed that the integration of the square of the HOMO over the volumes defined by the ELF should be a local index for predicting the most nucleophilic site of a molecule. We present here some computational results on simple systems in order to get some insights about this possibility.</p>

					<p>The concept of the ensemble Kohn–Sham hardness is introduced. It is shown that the first excitation energy can be given by the Kohn–Sham hardness (i.e. the energy difference of the ground-state lowest unoccupied and highest occupied levels) plus an extra term coming from the partial derivative of the ensemble exchange-correlation energy with respect to the weighting factor w in the limit $w  \rightarrow 0$. It is proposed that the first excitation energy can be used as a reactivity index instead of the hardness.</p>

				<title>Electron localization functions and local measures of the covariance</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0441-0454</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electron localization measure proposed by Becke and Edgecombe is shown to be related to the covariance of the electron pair distribution. Just as with the electron localization function, the local covariance does not seem to be, in and of itself, a useful quantity for elucidating shell structure. A function of the local covariance, however, is useful for this purpose. A different function, based on the hyperbolic tangent, is proposed to elucidate the shell structure encapsulated by the local covariance; this function also seems to work better for the electron localization measure of Becke and Edgecombe. In addition, we propose a different measure for the electron localization that incorporates both the electron localization measure of Becke and Edgecombe and the Laplacian of the electron density; preliminary indications are that this measure is especially good at elucidating the shell structure in valence regions. Methods for evaluating electron localization functions directly from the electron density, without recourse to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, are discussed.</p>

				<title>Geometric interpretation of density displacements and charge sensitivities</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0455-0466</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ``geometric” interpretation of the electronic density displacements in the Hilbert space is given and the associated projection-operator partitioning of the hardness and softness operators (kernels) is developed. The eigenvectors |&#198;$\rangle  = \{|\alpha \rangle \}$ of the hardness operator define the complete (identity) projector $ \hat{P} = \sum_\alpha | \alpha \rangle \langle \alpha = 1$ for general density displacements, including the \textit{charge-transfer} (CT) component, while the eigenvectors $| \boldmath{i} \rangle = \{ | i\rangle\}$ of the linear response operator determine the \textit{polarizational} $P$-projector, $\hat{P}_P = \sum_i | i \rangle\langle i|$. Their difference thus defines the complementary CT-projector: $\hat{P}_{CT} = 1 - \hat{P}_P$. The complete vector space for density displacements can be also spanned by supplementing the $P$-modes with the homogeneous CT-mode. These subspaces separate the integral (normalization) and local aspects of density shifts in molecular systems.</p>

				<title>The reaction force: Three key points along an intrinsic reaction coordinate</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0467-0472</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concept of the reaction force is presented and discussed in detail. For typical processes with energy barriers, it has a universal form which defines three key points along an intrinsic reaction coordinate: the force minimum, zero and maximum. We suggest that the resulting four zones be interpreted as involving preparation of reactants in the first, transition to products in the second and third, and relaxation in the fourth. This general picture is supported by the distinctive patterns of the variations in relevant electronic properties. Two important points that are brought out by the reaction force are that (a) the traditional activation energy comprises two separate contributions, and (b) the transition state corresponds to a balance between the driving and the retarding forces.</p>

					<p>Dynamic behaviors of chemical concepts in density functional theory such as frontier orbitals (HOMO/LUMO), chemical potential, hardness, and electrophilicity index have been investigated in this work in the context of Bohn-Oppenheimer quantum molecular dynamics in association with molecular conformation changes. Exemplary molecular systems like CH$^+_5$ , Cl$^–$ (H$_2$O)$_{30}$ and Ca$^{2+}$ (H$_2$O)$_{15}$ are studied at 300 K in the gas phase, demonstrating that HOMO is more dynamic than LUMO, chemical potential and hardness often fluctuate concurrently. It is argued that DFT concepts and indices may serve as a good framework to understand molecular conformation changes as well as other dynamic phenomena.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The third term in the Taylor expansion of the total energy functional around the number of electrons $N$ is evaluated as the second-order derivative of orbital Kohn–Sham energies with respect to orbital occupancy. Present approach is an extension of an efficient algorithm to compute densityfunctional based orbital reactivity indices. Various energy derivatives used to approximate orbital reactivity indices are defined within the space spanned by the orbital occupation numbers and the Kohn–Sham one-electron energies. The third-order energy functional derivative has to be considered for singular hardness tensor ([$\eta$]). On the contrary, this term has negligible influence on the reactivity index values for atomic or molecular systems with positively defined hardness tensors. In this context, stability of a system in equilibrium state estimated through the eigenvalues of [h] is discussed. Numerical illustration of the Kohn–Sham energy functional derivatives in orbital resolution up to the third order is shown for benchmark molecules such as H$_2$O, H$_2$S, and OH$^–$.</p>

The most frequently explored are global, reactant, atoms-in-molecule, orbital, and local resolutions. In this paper we have considered reactant resolution, i.e., the mutually polarized reactants before the charge-transfer among them.

				<abstract>
					<p>Using the constrained search and Legendre-transform formalisms, one can derive ``generalized” density-functional theories, in which the fundamental variable is either the electron pair density or the second-order reduced density matrix. In both approaches, the $N$-representability problem is solved by the functional, and the variational principle is with respect to all pair densities (density matrices) that are nonnegative and appropriately normalized. The Legendre-transform formulation provides a lower bound on the constrained-search functional. Noting that experience in density-functional and density-matrix theories suggests that it is easier to approximate functionals than it is to approximate the set of $N$-representable densities sheds some light on the significance of this work.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The structure and coordination chemistry of boron porphyrin complexes B$_2$OX$_2$ (T$_p$YPP) (X = OH, F; Y = Cl, CH$_3$) in connection with its chemical reactivity are analyzed at \textit{ab initio} density functional theory B3LYP/6-31G$^{\ast}$ and restricted Hartree–Fock RHF/6-31G$^{\ast}$ levels of theory. Global reactivity and local selectivity descriptors are used as adequate tools to analyze the isomerism effect ($Z$ or $E$ isomer) and the substitution effect (X: in axial ligand; or Y: in porphyrin ligand). In all the cases, we find that the $E$ conformation is the most stable one, in agreement with X-ray results, and that a principle of maximum hardness in the isomerism analysis is fullfilled. In the substitution analysis, we find that the three global reactivity indexes ($\eta$, $\omega$, $\chi$) and the two local reactivity indexes ($f_k$, electrostatic potential) used in this paper predict the same trend when an electron-withdrawing substituent is replaced by an electron donor. Finally, we show that substitution in the porphyrin ligand is slightly more significant than that in the axial ligand.</p>

				<title>Chemical reactivity of hypervalent silicon compounds: The local hard and soft acids and bases principle viewpoint</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0525-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The silicon atom may increase its coordination number to values greater than four, to form pentacoordinated compounds. It has been observed experimentally that, in general, pentacoordinated compounds show greater reactivity than tetracoordinated compounds. In this work, density functional theory is used to calculate the global softness and the condensed softness of the silicon atom for SiH$_n$F$_{4–n}$ and SiH$_n$F$^{1–}_{5–n}$. The values obtained show that the global and condensed softness are greater in the pentacoordinated compounds than in the tetracoordinated compounds, a result that explains the enhanced reactivity. If the results are analysed through a local version of the hard and soft acids and bases principle, it is possible to suggest that in nucleophilic substitution reactions, soft nucleophiles preferably react with SiH$_n$F$^{1–}_{5–n}$, and hard nucleophiles with SiH$_n$F$_{4–n}$.</p>

				<title>Application of localized reactivity index in combination with periodic DFT calculation to rationalize the swelling mechanism of clay type inorganic material</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0533-0539</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Clays are layered alumino-silicates. Clays swell and expand in aqueous solution. This property governs the usage of these materials in synthesis of nano-composites and is a source of many of its catalytic applications. We used both localized and periodic calculations within the realm of density functional theory (DFT) on a series of monovalent (Li$^+$, Na$^+$, K$^+$, Rb$^+$, Cs$^+$), and divalent (Mg$^{2+}$, Ca$^{2+}$, Sr$^{2+}$, Ba$^{2+}$) cations, to monitor their effect on the swelling of clays. The activity order obtained for the exchangeable cations among all the monovalent and divalent series studied is: Mg$^{2+} &gt; Ca$^{2+}$ &gt; Sr$^{2+}$ &gt; Ba$^{2+}$ &gt; Cs$^{+}$ &gt; Rb$^+$ &gt; Na$^+$ &gt; Li$^+$ &gt; K$^+$. We have studied two types of clays, montmorillonite and beidellite, with different surface structures and with/without water using periodic calculations. We have calculated the layer spacing at the first, second and third hydration shells of exchangeable cation, to compare with the experimental $d$-spacing values to correlate with humidity. A novel quantitative scale is proposed in terms of the intermolecular relative nucleophilicity of the active cation sites in their hydrated state through Fukui functions using hard–soft acid base (HSAB) principle. Finally, a swelling mechanism is proposed. This is a unique study where a combination of periodic and localized calculations has been performed to validate the capability of reactivity index calculations in material designing.</p>

				<title>A philicity based analysis of adsorption of small molecules in zeolites</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>00-00</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Adsorption of small molecules like CH$_4$, CO and NH$_3$ into the acid sites of zeolites is analysed as an interaction between an electrophile and a nucleophile. Global reactivity descriptors like softness and electrophilicity, and local reactivity descriptors like the Fukui function, local softness and local philicity are calculated within density functional as well as Hartree–Fock frameworks using both Mulliken and Hirshfeld population analysis schemes. The HSAB principle and the best electrophilenucleophile combination suggest that the reaction between the NH$_3$ and Brönsted acid site of the zeolite is the strongest. Interaction between the zeolite and a small probe molecule takes place through the most electrophilic atom of one with the most nucleophilic atom of the other. This result is in conformity with those provided by the frontier orbital theory and the local HSAB principle.</p>

					<p>In earlier work, the present authors have shown that hardness profiles are less dependent on the level of calculation than energy profiles for potential energy surfaces (PESs) having pathological behaviors. At variance with energy profiles, hardness profiles always show the correct number of stationary points. This characteristic has been used to indicate the existence of spurious stationary points on the PESs. In the present work, we apply this methodology to the hydrogen fluoride dimer, a classical difficult case for the density functional theory methods.</p>

				<page>0555-0560</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The performance of three exchange and correlation density functionals, LDA, BLYP and B3LYP, with four basis sets is tested in three intramolecular hydrogen shift reactions. The best reaction and activation energies come from the hybrid functional B3LYP with triple-$\zeta$ basis sets, when they are compared with high-level post-Hartree–Fock results from the literature. For a fixed molecular geometry, the electrophilic Fukui function is computed from a finite difference approximation. Fukui function shows a small dependence with both the exchange and correlation functional and the basis set. Evolution of the Fukui function along the reaction path describes important changes in the basic sites of the corresponding molecules. These results are in agreement with the chemical behavior of those species.</p>

				<title>Regioselectivity in the [$2 + 2$] cyclo-addition reaction of triplet carbonyl compounds to substituted alkenes (Paterno–Büchi reaction): A spin-polarized conceptual DFT approach</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0561-0571</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Regioselectivity of the photochemical [$2 + 2$] cyclo-addition of triplet carbonyl compounds with a series of ground state electron-rich and electron-poor alkenes, the Paterno–Büchi reaction, is studied. Activation barriers for the first step of the triplet reaction are computed in the case of the O-attack. Next, the observed regioselectivity is explained using a series of DFT-based reactivity indices. In the first step, we use the local softness and the local HSAB principle within a softness matching approach, and explain the relative activation barriers of the addition step. In the final step, the regioselectivity is assessed within the framework of spin-polarized conceptual density functional theory, considering response functions of the system's external potential $v$, number of electrons $N$ and spin number $N_s$, being the difference between the number of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ electrons in the spin-polarized system. Although the concept of local spin philicity, introduced recently within this theory, appears less suited to predict the regioselectivity in this reaction, the correct regioselectivity emerges from considering an interaction between the largest values of the generalized Fukui functions $f_{ss}$ on both interacting molecules.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>B3LYP/6-31G($d$) calculations were performed to obtain all the transition states and products for the 128 distinct reaction channels of Diels–Alder reactions by taking all possible combinations from a series of dienes (1N-a, 1N-b, 2N, 1P-a, 1P-b, 2P, 1O, 1S) and dienophiles (NE, PE, OE, SE, AE, OHE, MeE, CNE). The predictive ability of the values to gauge the regioselectivity of the putative [$4 + 2$] cycloaddition reactions is analysed. No correlation is obtained between the reaction energies and activation energies. The extent of asynchronicity is measured based on the bond order analysis. DFT-based descriptors such as the local softness ($s^+_k$ and $s_k^–$), Fukui function indices ($f^+_k$ and $f_k^–$), global electrophilicity index ($\omega$) and local electrophilicity index ($\omega_w$) were found to be better than the conventional FMO predictions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>It has been shown recently, how the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and vibrational modes is reflected in the properties of molecules. The necessary derivatives have been analyzed and their thermodynamic relations were demonstrated. This present work is focused on the analysis of a molecular system, under the influence of C–PCM induced solvent effect. The analysis is based on reactivity indices derived from DFT. The shift of frequency for diatomic molecules has been obtained. It has been identified as chemical force effect. The role of nuclear reactivity indices has been emphasized. This concept has been extended to obtain regional chemical potential values within C–PCM model for polyatomic molecules</p>

					<p>In this paper, we have introduced the atomic descriptors $s(f)_k$ to determine the local reactive sites of the molecular systems during electrophilic, nucleophilic and radical attacks. The condensed Fukui function and the newly introduced condensed atomic descriptor have been calculated for six different systems, namely glycine, alanine, aniline, BH$_2$Cl, \textit{trans}-FC(O)OF and $m$-anisidine. The individual atomic charges (gross charge) calculated by the MPA scheme have been used to calculate the condensed Fukui functions ($f_k$) and the newly derived condensed atomic descriptors ($sf$)$^{\alpha}_k$ at B1-DZP level of theory. We carried out the calculation using the ``stockholders” charge partitioning technique (i.e., Hirshfeld population scheme). The newly derived quantity gives the same reactive sites as the condensed Fukui functions, and the complexities associated with the negative Fukui functions are removed.</p>

				<title>A conceptual DFT approach towards analysing toxicity</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0599-0612</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The applicability of DFT-based descriptors for the development of toxicological structure–activity relationships is assessed. Emphasis in the present study is on the quality of DFT-based descriptors for the development of toxicological QSARs and, more specifically, on the potential of the electrophilicity concept in predicting toxicity of benzidine derivatives and the series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) expressed in terms of their biological activity data ($pIC_{50}$). First, two benzidine derivatives, which act as electron-donating agents in their interactions with biomolecules are considered. Overall toxicity in general and the most probable site of reactivity in particular are effectively described by the global and local electrophilicity parameters respectively. Interaction of two benzidine derivatives with nucleic acid (NA) bases/selected base pairs is determined using Parr’s charge transfer formula. The experimental biological activity data ($pIC_{50}$) for the family of PAH, namely polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), polyhalogenated dibenzo-$p$-dioxins (PHDD) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are taken as dependent variables and the HF energy ($E$), along with DFT-based global and local descriptors, viz., electrophilicity index ($\omega$) and local electrophilic power ($\omega^+$) respectively are taken as independent variables. Fairly good correlation is obtained showing the significance of the selected descriptors in the QSAR on toxins that act as electron acceptors in the presence of biomolecules. Effects of population analysis schemes in the calculation of Fukui functions as well as that of solvation are probed. Similarly, some electron-donor aliphatic amines are studied in the present work. We see that global and local electrophilicities along with the HF energy are adequate in explaining the toxicity of several substances</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Several new diaryl diselenides having intramolecular coordinating groups have been synthesized by ortho-lithiation/Na$_2$Se$_2$ routes in good yield. Bis[2-(N-phenylferrocenecarboxamide)] diselenide ({\bf 10}), bis[2-(N-\textit{tert}-butylferrocenecarboxamide)] diselenide ({\bf 11}), ($S$)($S$)-bis[2(-$N$-phenethylferrocenecarboxamide)] diselenide ({\bf 12}) were synthesized by the ortho-lithiation route. Bis[2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethylnaphthyl)] diselenide ({\bf 13}) was synthesized by lithium/bromide exchange reaction whereas bis(2,4-dinitrophenyl) diselenide ({\bf 14}) was prepared by the reaction of disodium diselenide with 2,4- dinitro-1-chlorobenzene. Thiol peroxidase-like activities of the diorganodiselenides have been evaluated by using H$_2$O$_2$ as substrate and PhSH as cosubstrate. Diselenides ({\bf 13}) and ({\bf 14}) with dimethylaminomethyl- or nitro-donor groups in close proximity to selenium, show much better thiol peroxidase-like activities compared to diselenides {\bf 10–12} with amide donor groups. Cyclic voltammetry study of diselenides {\bf 10–12} derived from redox-active ferrocenamide has been carried out.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fe-Mg-hydrotalcite (Mg/Fe = 3) anionic clay with or without calcination (at 200–800$^\circ$C) has been used for the benzylation of toluene and other aromatic compounds by benzyl chloride. Hydrotalcite before and after its calcination was characterized for surface area, crystalline phases and basicity. Both the hydrotalcite, particularly after its use in the benzylation reaction, and the catalyst derived from it by its calcination at 200–800$^\circ$C show high catalytic activity for the benzylation of toluene and other aromatic compounds. The catalytically active species present in the catalyst in its most active form are the chlorides and oxides of iron on the catalyst surface.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Binding of quercetin to human serum albumin (HSA) was studied and the binding constant measured by following the red-shifted absorption spectrum of quercetin in the presence of HSA and the quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence in the presence of different concentrations of quercetin. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of HSA showed decrease in the average lifetimes indicating binding at a location, near the tryptophan moiety, and the possibility of fluorescence energy transfer between excited tryptophan and quercetin. Critical transfer distance ($R_o$) was determined, from which the mean distance between tryptophan-214 in HSA and quercetin was calculated.

				<title>Mechanism of interaction of vincristine sulphate and rifampicin with bovine serum albumin: A spectroscopic study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0649-0655</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mechanism of interaction of vincristine sulphate (VS) and rifampicin (RF) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been studied by quenching of BSA fluorescence by RF/VS. The Stern–Volmer plot indicates the presence of a static component in the quenching mechanism. Results also show that both the tryptophan residues of BSA are accessible to VS and RF. The high magnitude of rate constant of quenching indicates that the process of energy transfer occurs by intermolecular interaction and VS/RFbinding site is in close proximity to the tryptophan residues of BSA. Binding studies in the presence of a hydrophobic probe, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonic acid sodium salt (ANS) indicate that the VS and RF compete with ANS for hydrophobic sites on the surface of BSA. Small decreases in critical micellar concentrations (CMC) of anionic surfactants in presence of VS/ RF show that the ionic character of VS/RF also contributes to binding. The temperature dependence of the association constant is used to estimate the values of the thermodynamic parameters involved in the interaction of VS/RF with BSA and the results indicate that hydrophobic forces play a significant role in the binding. Circular dichroism studies reveal that the change in helicity of BSA are due to binding of VS/RF to BSA.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Adsorption of ferric ions by chitin was studied by the batch equilibration method. The influence of particle size and dosage of the adsorbant, contact time, initial concentration of the adsorbate and temperature were experimentally verified. The effect of anions like chloride, nitrate and sulphate and also of cations like zinc, chromium and copper on the adsorption of iron(III) was determined. The time dependence of fraction of adsorption, $Y_t$, at varying particle sizes and doses of chitin and the intraparticle diffusion rate constants, $k_p$, of the adsorption process were calculated. Thermodynamic and equilibrium parameters of the reaction were determined to understand the sorption behaviour of chitin. The results revealed that the adsorption of iron(III) by chitin is spontaneous, endothermic and favourable.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We relate in this study the thermal expansivity, $\alpha_P$, to the Raman frequency shift ($1/v$)($\partial v/\partial P$)$_T$ for the rotatory lattice (librational) mode in ammonia solid II near its melting point. We have used our calculated Raman frequencies of this mode for pressures of $3 \cdot 65$, $5 \cdot 02$ and $6 \cdot 57$ kbars for this crystalline system. The values of the slope, d$P_m$/dT, which we deduced from our spectroscopic relation, are compared with those obtained experimentally. In particular, our computed slope value for the pressure of $5 \cdot 02$ kbar is in very good agreement with the empirical result.</p>

					<p>Pyrolysis of thiophene over nickel nanoparticles dispersed on silica is shown to yield Yjunction carbon nanotubes with smaller diameters than those obtained by the pyrolysis of organometallicthiophene mixtures. In the presence of water vapour, the pyrolysis of organometallic-hydrocarbon mixtures yields single-walled nanotubes, as well as relatively narrow-diameter carbon nanotubes with Y-junctions. Pyrolysis of organometallic-hydrocarbon mixtures, in the absence of water vapour, only gives nanotubes with T- and Y-junctions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Single-domain barium ferrite nano particles have been synthesized with narrow particle-size distribution using an auto combustion technique. In this process, citric acid was used as a fuel. Ratios of cation to fuel were maintained variously at 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3. The pH was 7 in all cases. Of all three cases, a cation to citric acid ratio of 1 : 2 gives better yield in the formation of crystalline and single domain particles with a narrow range of size distribution. Most particles are in the range of 80 to 100 nm. Maximum magnetization and coercivity values are also greater for 1 : 2 ratios. These values measured at room temperature are found to be 55 emu/gram and 5000 Oe respectively. XPS and ESR studies support the results.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in chemistry and biology: Non-Förster distance dependence of the FRET rate</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Recent Developments in Metal Oxides and Related Materials</feature>
				<page>0023-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a popular tool to study equilibrium and dynamical properties of polymers and biopolymers in condensed phases and is now widely used in conjunction with single molecule spectroscopy. In the data analysis, one usually employs the Förster expression which predicts ($1/R^6$) distance dependence of the energy transfer rate. However, critical analysis shows that this expression can be of rather limited validity in many cases. We demonstrate this by explicitly considering a donor–acceptor system, polyfluorene (PF$_6$)-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP), where the size of both donor and acceptor is comparable to the distance separating them. In such cases, one may expect much weaker distance (as $1/R^2$ or even weaker) dependence. We have also considered the case of energy transfer from a dye to a nanoparticle. Here we find $1/R^4$ distance dependence at large separations, completely different from Förster. We also discuss recent application of FRET to study polymer conformational dynamics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using molten salt route (with NaCl/KCl as the salt) we have been able to synthesize a new form of magnesium tantalate at 850$^\circ$C. Powder X-ray diffraction data could be indexed on an orthorhombic unit cell with lattice parameters, `$a$' = 15$\cdot$36(1) Å, ‘$b$’ = $13\dot 38$(1) Å and ‘$c$’ = $12\cdot 10$(1) Å. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction studies confirm the results obtained by X-ray studies. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy helps ascertain the composition of MgTa$_2$O$_6$. The title compound shows a dielectric constant of $\tilde 24$ with a low dielectric loss of $0 \cdot 006$ at 100 kHz at room temperature. Dielectric constant is nearly unchanged with rise in temperature while the loss shows a very marginal increase ($0 \cdot 007$ at 300$^\circ$C).</p>

Single crystals were grown by the melt-cooling technique and the crystal structure was solved in the tetragonal $I4/m$ space group with $a = 3 \cdot 839$ (1) Å, $c = 16 \cdot 382$ (5) Å, $V = 241 \cdot 4$ (1) Å$^3$, $Z = 4$ and was refined to an $R$ index of $0 \cdot 0672$. The structure represents a modification of the Aurivillius phase and consists of [$Bi_2O_2$]$^{2+}$ units separated by WO$_8$ polyhedra. a.c. impedance studies indicate oxide ion conductivity of 2$\cdot$91 10$^{–5}$ Scm$^{–1}$ at 600$^\circ$C.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A completely automated temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) system for carrying out gas–solid catalytic reactions under atmospheric flow conditions is fabricated to study CO and hydrocarbon oxidation, and NO reduction. The system consists of an all-stainless steel UHV system, quadrupole mass spectrometer SX200 (VG Scientific), a tubular furnace and micro-reactor, a temperature controller, a versatile gas handling system, and a data acquisition and analysis system. The performance of the system has been tested under standard experimental conditions for CO oxidation over well-characterized Ce$_{1–x–y}$Pt$_x$(La/Y)$_y$O$_{2–\delta}$ catalysts. Testing of 3-way catalysis with CO, NO and C$_2$H$_2$ to convert to CO$_2$, N$_2$ and H$_2$O is done with this catalyst which shows complete removal of pollutants below 325$^\circ$C. Fixed oxide-ion defects in Pt substituted Ce$_{1–y}$(La/Y)$_y$O$_{2–y/2}$ show higher catalytic activity than Pt ion-substituted CeO$_2$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A hydrothermal reaction of a mixture of ZnCl$_2$, V$_2$O$_5$, ethylenediamine and water gave rise to a layered poly oxovanadate material [Zn$_2$(NH$_2$(CH$_2$)$_2$NH$_2$)$_5$][$\{$Zn(NH$_2$(CH$_2$)$_2$NH$_2$)$_2 \}_2$$\{$V$_{18}$O$_{42}$(H$_2$O)$\}$]$\cdot x$H$_2$O ($x \cdot 12$) ({\bf I}) consisting of [V$_{18}$O$_{42}$]$^{12–}$ clusters. These clusters, with all the vanadium ions in the $+4$ state, are connected together through Zn(NH$_2$(CH$_2$)$_2$NH$_2$)$_2$ linkers forming a two-dimensional structure. The layers are also separated by distorted trigonal bipyramidal [Zn$_2$(NH$_2$(CH$_2$)$_2$NH$_2$)$_5$] complexes. The structure, thus, presents a dual role for the Zn-ethylenediamine complex. The magnetic susceptibility studies indicate that the interactions between the V centres in {\bf I} are predominantly antiferromagnetic in nature and the compound shows highly frustrated behaviour. The magnetic properties are compared to the theoretical calculations based on the Heisenberg model, in addition to correlating to the structure. Crystal data for the complexes are presented.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Recent Developments in Metal Oxides and Related Materials</feature>
				<page>0067-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Symmetrized density-matrix-renormalization-group calculations have been carried out, within Pariser–Parr–Pople Hamiltonian, to explore the nature of the ground and low-lying excited states of long polythiophene oligomers. We have exploited $C_2$ symmetry and spin parity of the system to obtain excited states of experimental interest, and studied the lowest dipole allowed excited state and lowest dipole forbidden two photon state, for different oligomer sizes. In the long system limit, the dipole allowed excited state always lies below the lowest dipole forbidden two-photon state which implies, by Kasha rule, that polythiophene fluoresces strongly. The lowest triplet state lies below two-photon state as usual in conjugated polymers. We have doped the system with a hole and an electron and obtained the charge excitation gap and the binding energy of the $1^1 B_u^–$ exciton. We have calculated the charge density of the ground, one-photon and two-photon states for the longer system size of 10 thiophene rings to characterize these states. We have studied bond order in these states to get an idea about the equilibrium excited state geometry of the system. We have also studied the charge density distribution of the singly and doubly doped polarons for longer system size, and observe that polythiophenes do not support bipolarons.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Recent Developments in Metal Oxides and Related Materials</feature>
				<page>0087-0092</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Disordered Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ shows a drastic reduction in saturation magnetization compared to highly ordered samples, moreover magnetization as a function of the temperature for different disordered samples shows qualitatively different behaviours. We investigate the origin of such diversity by performing spatially resolved photoemission spectroscopy on various disordered samples. Our results establish that extensive electronic inhomogeneity, arising most probably from an underlying chemical inhomogeneity in disordered samples, is responsible for the observed magnetic inhomogeneity. It is further pointed out that these inhomogeneities are connected with composition fluctuations of the type Sr$_2$Fe$_{1+x}$Mo$_{1–x}$O$_6$ with Fe-rich ($x$ &gt; 0) and Mo-rich ($x$ &lt; 0) regions.</p>

					<p>Lightweight grids for lead-acid battery grids have been prepared from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) copolymer followed by coating with lead. Subsequently, the grids have been electrochemically coated with a conductive and corrosion-resistant layer of polyaniline. These grids are about 75&#37; lighter than those employed in conventional lead-acid batteries. Commercial-grade 6V/3$\cdot$5Ah (C$_{20}$-rate) lead-acid batteries have been assembled and characterized employing positive and negative plates constituting these grids. The specific energy of such a lead-acid battery is about 50 Wh/kg. The batteries can withstand fast charge–discharge duty cycles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Structural, magnetic and magnetotransport properties of La$_{0 \cdot 7 –x}$Ce$_x$Ba$_{0 \cdot 3}$MnO$_3$ ($x = 0–0 \cdot 4$) have been investigated although some unreacted secondary phases of CeO$_2$ were present. The rhombohedral structure ($R-3c$) for $x = 0$ transforms to orthorhombic with the space group \textit{Imma} for $x = 0 \cdot 3$. All samples showed ferromagnetic transition above 300 K and a negative magnetoresistance. For $x$ &gt; $0 \cdot 1$, magnetization data measured at 1 T showed a decrease at low temperatures ($T$ &lt; 50 K) due to antiferromagnetic coupling between Ce-local moments and Mn-moments. For $x = 0 \cdot 4$, the resistivity showed a maximum around 200 K which corresponds to ordering temperature of cerium. Since these results are similar to that observed in the Sr-containing La$_{0 \cdot 5–x}$Ce$_x$Sr$_{0 \cdot 5$MnO$_{3}$ ($x = 0–0 \cdot 4$) system, we suggest that the cerium ions are in the trivalent state and the anomalous behaviour has been attributed to a Kondo-like effect.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The internal surface of an Mg–Al layered double hydroxide has been functionalized by anchoring carboxy-methyl derivatized $\beta$-cyclodextrin cavities to the gallery walls. Neutral polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been included within the functionalized solid by driving the hydrophobic aromatic molecules from a polar solvent into the less polar interior of the anchored cyclodextrin cavities by a partitioning process. The optical (absorption and emission) properties of the PAH molecules included within the functionalized Mg–Al layered double hydroxide solid are similar to that of dilute solutions of the PAH in non-polar solvents. The unique feature of these hybrid materials is that they are thermally stable over a wide temperature range with their emission properties practically unaltered.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Recent Developments in Metal Oxides and Related Materials</feature>
				<page>0127-0133</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Layered hydroxides crystallize in a hexagonal structure and incorporate a number of different types of structural disorders as an exigency of anisotropic bonding. Structural disorder contributes to the non-uniform broadening of lines in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. Common among the disorders are stacking faults, which broaden the $h0 \ell/0k\ell$ reflections. Interstratification selectively broadens the $00\ell$ reflections and turbostratic disorder broadens the $0k\ell$ reflections. The line broadening caused by structural disorder has to be discounted before estimates of particle size are made by applying the Scherrer formula.</p>

				<page>0135-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solid state ionic conductors are important from an industrial viewpoint. A variety of such conductors have been found. In order to understand the reasons for high ionic conductivity in these solids, there have been a number of experimental, theoretical and computational studies in the literature. We provide here a survey of these investigations with focus on what is known and elaborate on issues that still remain unresolved. Conductivity depends on a number of factors such as presence of interstitial sites, ion size, temperature, crystal structure etc. We discuss the recent results from atomistic computer simulations on the dependence of conductivity in NASICONs as a function of composition, temperature, phase change and cation among others. A new potential for modelling of NASICON structure that has been proposed is also discussed.</p>

				<title>Two new polyoxovanadate clusters templated through cysteamine</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0159-0164</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two new fully oxidized polyoxovanadate cluster-based solids (C$_4$N$_2$S$_2$H$_{14}$)$_2$[H$_2$V$_{10}$O$_{28}$]$\cdot 4$H$_2$O, {\bf 1} and (C$_4$N$_2$S$_2$H$_{14}$)$_5$[H$_4$V$_{15}$O$_{42}$]$_2 \cdot 10$H$_2$O, {\bf 2} are crystallized under self-assembly process in the presence of cysteamine. In both {\bf 1} and {\bf 2}, cysteamines are oxidized forming disulphide linkages and occur as counter cations. The organic cations assemble around V$_{10}$O$_{28}$ cluster anions in {\bf 1} whereas they aggregate around V$_{15}$O$_{42}$ clusters in {\bf 2}. pH appears to be the structure determinant in the occurrence of decavanadate cluster in {\bf 1} and pentadecavanadate in {\bf 2}, with the same counter cation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Equimolar interaction of VO(OP$_r^i$)$_3$ with N-phenyldiethanolamine (H$_2$L) affords the dimeric complex [VO(L)($\mu$-OPr$^i$)]$_2$ ({\bf 1}), which on reaction with different glycols yields a new class of oxovanadium(V) complexes of the type: VO(L)(OGOH) (where L = C$_6$H$_5$N(CH$_2$CH$_2$O$^–$)$_2$ and G = G$^1$ (CMe$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$CMe$_2$) {\bf 2}, G$^2$(CHMeCH$_2$CMe$_2$) {\bf 3}, G$^3$(CH$_2$CMe$_2$CH$_2$) {\bf 4}, G$^4$(CH$_2$CEt$_2$CH$_2$) {\bf 5}, G$^5$(CHMeCHMe) {\bf 6}, G$^6$(CMe$_2$CMe$_2$) {\bf 7}), featuring N-phenyldiethanolaminate and glycolate moieties. Complexes ({\bf 2})–({\bf 7}) react with Al(OPr$^i$)$_3$ to afford novel heterobimetallic coordination complexes of the type: VO(L)$\{$(OGO)Al(OPr$^i$)$_2\}$ (G = G$^1$–G$^6$). All these complexes have been characterised by elemental analyses and molecular weight measurements. Spectroscopic (IR, UV–Vis and (${}^1$H, ${}^{27}$Al, ${}^{51}$V) NMR) properties of the new complexes have been investigated and their plausible structures suggested.</p>

					<p>The reaction of \textit{ctc}-[Ru(R-aapm)$_2$Cl$_2$] ({\bf 1}) with (NH$_4$)$_2$MoS$_4$ in aqueous MeOH afforded redviolet mixed ligand complexes of the type [(R-aapm)$_2$Ru($\mu$-S)$_2$Mo(OH)$_2$] ({\bf 2a–2e}) [R-aapm = 2-(arylazo) pyrimidine, $p$-R-C$_6$H$_4$-N=N-C$_4$H$_3$NN, R = H ({\bf 2a}), Me ({\bf 2b}), Cl ({\bf 2c}), OMe ({\bf 2d}), NO$_2$ ({\bf 2e})]. In complexes ({\bf 2a–2e}) the terminal Mo=S bonds of the MoS$_4^{2–}$ unit get hydroxylated and the molybdenum ion is reduced from the starting Mo$^{VI}$ in MoS$_4^{2–}$ to Mo$^{IV}$ in the final product. The solution electronic spectra exhibit a strong MLCT band at 550–570 nm in DCM. The ${}^1$H NMR spectra confirms the geometry of the complexes as being that of \textit{cis-trans-cis} isomers. Cyclic voltammograms show a Ru(III)/Ru(II) couple at $1\cdot 10–1 \cdot 4$ V, irreversible Mo(IV)/Mo(V) oxidations in the $1 \cdot 66–1 \cdot 72$ V range, along with four successive reversible ligand reductions in the range $–0 \cdot 45–0 \cdot 67$ V (one electron), $–0 \cdot 82–1 \cdot 12$ V (one electron), $–1 \cdot 44–1 \cdot 90$ V (simultaneously two electrons).</p>

				<title>Tuning size and catalytic activity of nano-clusters of cobalt oxide</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0179-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cobalt oxides were prepared by three different methods: (1) by reacting cobalt nitrate with oxalic acid, (2) co-precipitating cobalt nitrate with sodium carbonate, and (3) using sodium dodecyl sulphate as organic surfactant. All three samples were characterized before and after calcination by solvent extraction and the resulting products examined by IR spectroscopy. In the case of method 3, the removal of surfactant was followed by TGA studies. Products from all three methods were identified by XRD. Peaks in low angle XRD indicate the porous nature of the oxides. The morphology of the pores was studied by transmission electron microscopy. Some irregular pore structures were obtained for samples from methods 1 and 2, with an average size of 4–6 nm. Only the product from method 3 using SDS as template showed ordered structure and optimum size, and Brunauer–Emmet–Teller surface areas of the as-prepared, as well as the treated samples, exhibited H3 type hysteresis. The samples from the three methods were used as catalysts in the oxidation reaction of cyclohexane under mild conditions and the catalytic efficiency of the cobalt oxide was comparable with mesoporous cobalt oxides.</p>

				<title>A study on equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange of alkaline earth metals using an inorganic cation exchanger – zirconium titanium phosphate</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0185-0189</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An advanced inorganic cation exchange material of the class of tetravalent metal acid (TMA) salt, zirconium titanium phosphate (ZTP), has been synthesized by a modified sol–gel technique. ZTP has been characterized by elemental analysis (ICP-AES), thermal analysis (TGA), FTIR and X-ray diffraction studies. The Nernst–Planck equation has been used to study the forward and reverse ion exchange kinetics of Mg (II), Ca (II), Sr (II) and Ba (II) with H (I) at four different temperatures. The mechanism of exchange is particle diffusion, as confirmed by the linear $\tau$ (dimensionless time parameter) vs $t$ (time) plots. The exchange process is thus controlled by the diffusion within the exchanger particles for the systems studied herein. Further, various kinetic parameters like self-diffusion coefficient ($D_0$), energy of activation ($E_a$) and entropy of activation ($\Delta S^\ast$) have been evaluated under conditions favouring a particle diffusion-controlled mechanism.</p>

					<p>The organic diammonium salt N,N'-dibenzyl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediammonium dibromide dihydrate, (dbtmen)Br$_2 \cdot 2$H$_2$O ({\bf 1}), was prepared by the reaction of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (tmen) with benzyl bromide. {\bf 1} crystallizes in the triclinic space group $P_1$ with the following unit cell dimensions for C$_{20}$H$_{34}$Br$_{2}$N$_2$O$_2$ (M = 494$\cdot$31): $a = 8 \cdot 6672$(6) Å, $b = 11 \cdot 7046$(8) Å, $c = 11 \cdot 7731$(8) Å, $\alpha = 76 \cdot 988$(8)$^circ$, $\beta = 88 \cdot 978$(8)$^\circ$, $\gamma = 76\cdot 198$(8)$^\circR, $V = 1129 \cdot 26$(13) Å$^3$, $Z = 2$. Three components, namely the (dbtmen)$^{2+}$ dication, two bromide anions and two crystal water molecules constitute the structural arrangement of {\bf 1}. H$_2$O molecules are linked to bromide anions via O–H$\cdots$Br hydrogen bonding interactions resulting in the formation of a four-membered $\{$O$_2$Br$_2\}$ cyclic dibromide. The $\{$O$_2$Br$_2\}$ units and the dications are arranged as alternating layers extending in the crystallographic $bc$ plane. The arrangement of anions and cations may be viewed as a typical lamellar structure. The crystal water molecules can be removed by heating {\bf 1} at 140$^\circ$C and the anhydrous dibromide thus formed can be fully rehydrated as evidenced by IR spectra and X-ray powder patterns.</p>

					<p>Reaction of oligomeric Cu(I) complexes [Cu$\{ \mu$-S-C(=NR)(O–Ar–CH$_3$)$\}$]$_n$ with Lewis acids gave Cu(I) carbene complexes, which were characterized by ${}^1$H and ${}^{13}$C NMR spectroscopy. Cu(I) carbene complexes could be directly generated from RNCS, Cu(I)–OAr and Lewis acids; this method can be used to prepare Cu(I) carbene complexes with different substitutents on the carbene carbon. The complexes were unreactive towards olefins and do not undergo cyclopropanation. Electronic structure calculations (DFT) show that the charge on the carbene carbon plays an important role in controlling the reactivity of the carbene complex.</p>

Compounds ({\bf 5a–l}) on one-pot ring conversion yielded the 1,3,4-oxadiazolin-2-one derivatives ({\bf 6a–l}), which on reaction with N$_2$H$_4$ gave the 4-amino-1,2,4-triazolin-3-ones ({\bf 7a–l}). All these compounds exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the few microbes tested. The carbamates have been found to be more toxic against fourth instar larvae of \textit{Aedes aegypti}, in particular, the $n$-butyl derivative ({\bf 3e}).</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0261-0267</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Influence of the presence of CO$_2$, which is a mild oxidant, on the performance of the thermal cracking of ethane to ethylene in the absence or presence of limited O$_2$ at different temperatures (750–900$^\circ$C), space velocities (1500–9000 h$^{–1}$) and CO$_2$/C$_2$H$_6$ and O$_2$/C$_2$H$_6$ mole ratios ($0–2 \cdot 0$ and $0–0 \cdot 3$ respectively) has been investigated. In both the presence and absence of limited O2, ethane conversion increases markedly because of the presence of CO$_2$, indicating its beneficial effect on the ethane to ethylene cracking. The increased ethane conversion is, however, not due to the oxidation of ethane to ethylene by CO$_2$; the formation of carbon monoxide in the presence of CO$_2$ is found to be very small. It is most probably due to the activation of ethane in the presence of CO$_2$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fundamental properties, density ($\rho$) and viscosity ($\eta$), of citric acid (CA) and disodium hydrogen orthophosphate (DSP) at various strengths were obtained at different temperatures. The $\rho$ and $\eta$ values were used to determine apparent molal volumes and viscosity of systems. The $\rho$, $V_\phi$ and $\eta$ values were regressed against molality $m$ for $\rho^0$, $\eta^0$ and $V^0_\phi$f, the limiting constants at infinite dilution ($m \rightarrow 0$) forionic and molecular interactions. The $\rho^0$ and $V^0_\phi$f of aq. acids are higher than those of aq. DSP and the viscosity of DSP is higher than that of aq. CA. Examination of $\rho^0$ and $V^0_\phi$ functions indicates that mutual compositions of CA and DSP counterbalance concentration and temperature effects on pH in bioprocesses.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive study of the electrochemical reduction of $\beta$-nitrostyrene and the corresponding heterocyclic analogue has been carried out in aprotic media using wax-impregnated carbon paste electrodes. Nitrostyrene exhibits quasi-reversible reduction process in aprotic medium at the waximpregnated carbon paste electrodes as compared to other electrodes reported in the literature. The nitroradical anion couple detected in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate is found to be stable only in aprotic media. Though, as reported, the pharmacological activity related to this nitro radical anion and its therapeutic value are related to the stability of the nitro radical anion, the stability itself depends on the electrode system employed. Added benzoic acid is found to bring about a positive shift in cathodic peak potential.</p>

				<title>Temperature effects on surface activity and application in oxidation of toluene derivatives of CTAB–SDS with KMnO$_4$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0281-0285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The $\gamma_{\text{cmc}}$ values of CTAB–SDS decrease from 63$\cdot$67 mN/m at 10$^\circ$C to 36$\cdot$38 mN/m at 90$^\circ$C, slightly lower than those of either CTAB or SDS. Correspondingly, the CMC of CTAB–SDS decreases almost by half. The increase of surface activity of CTAB–SDS can be attributed to the relatively weak electrostatic interaction at high temperature, which is supported by the increase of solubility of CTAB–SDS with rise in temperature. Catalytic effect on oxidation of toluene derivatives with potassium permanganate follows the order CTAB–SDS &gt; SDS &gt; CTAB. This is not caused by the dissociative effect of CTAB–SDS with low surface activity at low temperature, as seen from the fact that almost all oxidative products can be retrieved for different toluene derivatives and surfactants by mimicking the conditions of reaction. In the emulsifications of toluene derivatives at 90$^\circ$C, the time that turbid water layers of surfactant solutions take to become clear is the same as that of the catalytic effect on oxidation of toluene derivatives. Thus, it can be inferred that surfactants can improve the oxidation yields of toluene derivatives by increasing the contact between two reacting phases.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>My professional research career spanning more than four decades has been largely devoted to synthetic medicinal chemistry (Ciba, Bombay – now Mumbai – 21 years) followed by an equal number of years in process development of drugs, crop protection chemicals (Searle, Bombay) and drugs and speciality chemicals (Recon and Hikal, Bangalore). These efforts have involved several collaborators including many from other institutions and offered multitudinous challenges calling for continuous creativity in industrial setups. I was fortunate to have had a conducive environment to be able to respond to these challenges. I attempt to offer the readers in the ensuing pages a flavour of the excitement that has marked these years.</p>

					<p>The open air reaction of the chiral Schiff base ligand H$_2$L, prepared by the condensation of L-phenylalaninol and 5-bromosalicylaldehyde, with Mn$^{II}$(CH$_3$COO)$_{2}\cdot$4H$_2$O yielded dark brown complex [Mn$^{IV}$L$_2$]$\cdot$0$\cdot$5 DMF ({\bf 1}). Compound {\bf 1} was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, UV–visible, CD and EPR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and room temperature magnetic moment determination. Singlecrystal X-ray analysis revealed that compound {\bf 1} crystallises in the monoclinic $P2_1$ space group with six mononuclear [Mn$^{IV}$L$_2$] units in the asymmetric unit along with three solvent DMF molecules. In the crystal structure, each Mn(IV) complex, acting as the building unit, undergoes supramolecular linking through C-H$\cdots$O bonds leading to an intricate hydrogen bonding network.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0327-0334</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protonation constant of an unsymmetrical Schiff base, salicylidene(N-benzoyl)glycyl hydrazone (SalBzGH), and formation constants of its complexes have been determined potentiometrically at different temperatures in aqueous dioxane medium. Complexes of SalBzGH with VO(IV), Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) have been prepared. Elemental analyses, pH-metric, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, electronic, IR, ESR, XRD (powder) and NMR studies have been carried out to study the coordination behaviour of SalBzGH toward these metal ions. pH-metric and ${}^1$H NMR studies show the presence of two dissociable protons in the ligand. IR and NMR spectra suggest the tridentate nature of the ligand, coordinating as a uninegative species in the Mn(II) complex and as a dinegative species in all the other complexes. Presence of two different conformers of the ligand at room temperature and stabilization of a single conformer upon complex formation have been established from ${}^1$H NMR spectra of the metal-free ligand, Zn(II) and Hg(II) complexes recorded at 296 K. Electronic and ESR spectra indicate highly distorted tetragonal geometry for VO(IV) and Cu(II) complexes. XRD powder patterns of the Zn(II) complexes are indexed for an orthorhombic crystal system.</p>

				<title>Optical absorption and fluorescence studies on imidazolium ionic liquids comprising the \textit{bis}(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide anion</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0335-0340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optical absorption and fluorescence behaviour of two rigorously purified imidazolium ionic liquids, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium \textit{bis}(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide are studied in the neat condition and in solution. Non-negligible absorption in the UV region with a long tail extending into the visible region is the main feature of the absorption. Excitation wavelength-dependent two-component fluorescence characterizes the emission behaviour of these liquids. That ion association gives rise to the long absorption tail and shifting fluorescence maximum, which appears to be common to most of the imidazolium ionic liquids, is evident from the effect of the conventional solvents.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0341-0344</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we have probed the dynamics of chlorine atom production from the gas phase photodissociation of carbon tetrachloride at 222 and 235 nm. The quantum yield, $\phi^{\ast}$ of Cl$^{\ast}$ ($^2P_{1/2}$) production has been determined by probing the nascent concentrations of both excited ($^2P_{1/2}$) and ground state (${}^2P_{3/2}$) chlorine atoms by suitable resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) detection schemes. Although at the photolysis wavelengths the absorption of carbon tetrachloride is weak, significant amounts of Cl$^{\ast}$ are produced. Surprisingly, the quantum yield of Cl$^{\ast}$ production does not follow the absorption spectrum closely, which gives rise to the possibility of an indirect dissociation mechanism present in CCl$_4$ along with direct dissociation at these ultraviolet wavelengths.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Considering the direct correlation between charge transfer and heat of adsorption, we have equated the isosteric heat of adsorption ($Q_{st}$) with Nalewajski's charge transfer equation involving equalized electronegativities and chemical hardness given in the literature. The equation is then tested and compared with the experimental heat of adsorption values of organic molecules over zeolites given in the literature with the average percentage deviation of 15$\cdot$9. Other similar types of equations of charge transfer affinity are also tested. Various semi-empirical equations based on Barrer's approach of the determination of $Q_{st}$ and neural network method have been proposed, tested and compared for the first time.</p>

				<title>A study of substituent effect on the oxidative strengths of sodium salts of N-bromo-arylsulphonamides: Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of D-fructose and D-glucose in alkaline medium</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0351-0359</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>N-Bromo-arylsulphonamides of different oxidizing strengths are used for studying the kinetics of oxidation of D-fructose and D-glucose in aqueous alkaline medium. The results are analysed and compared with those from the sodium salts of N-bromo-benzenesulphonamide and N-bromo-4-methylbenzenesulphonamide. The reactions show zero-order kinetics in [oxidant], fractional order in [Fru/Glu] and nearly first order in [OH$^–$]. Rates of oxidation of fructose are higher than those for glucose with the same oxidant. Similarly, $E_a$ values for glucose oxidations are higher than those for fructose. The results are explained by a suitable mechanism and the related rate law is deduced. The effective oxidising species in the reactions of N-bromo-arylsulphonamides is Br$^+$. The oxidative strengths of the latter therefore depend on the ease with which Br$^+$ is released from them. The ease with which Br$^+$ is released from Nbromo- arylsulphonamides depends on the electron density on the nitrogen atom of the sulphonamide group, which in turn depends on the nature of the substituent on the benzene ring. The validity of the Hammett equation has also been tested for oxidation of both fructose and glucose. Enthalpies and entropies of activations of the oxidations by all the N-bromo-arylsulphonamides correlate well. The effect of substitution on $E_a$ and log $A$ of the oxidations is also considered.</p>

				<title>Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic studies of dithia tetraphenylporphine</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0361-0369</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here infrared absorption spectra of dithia tetraphenylporphine and its cation in the 450–1600 and 2900–3400 cm$^{–1}$ regions. Most of the allowed IR bands are observed in pairs due to overall $D_{2h}$ point group symmetry of the molecule. The observed bands have been assigned to the porphyrin skeleton and phenyl ring modes. Some weak bands, which are forbidden under $D_{2h}$, also appear in the spectra due to the distortion of the molecule from planarity-caused by the out-of-plane positioned N and S atoms. Increased intensity of some phenyl ring bands compared to free-base tetraphenylporphine is explained on the basis of rotation of phenyl rings towards the mean molecular plane. Contrary to the point group symmetry of cation of dithia tetraphenylporphine, certain bands are observed to be degenerate due to identical bonding arrangements in pyrrole rings of the cation.</p>

				<page>0375-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the synthesis of stearate functionalized nanobubbles of SiO$_2$ with a few aniline molecules inside, represented as C$_6$H$_5$NH$_2$&#64;SiO$_2$&#64;stearate, exhibiting fluorescence with red-shifted emission. Stearic acid functionalization allows the materials to be handled just as free molecules, for dissolution, precipitation, storage etc. The methodology adopted involves adsorption of aniline on the surface of gold nanoparticles with subsequent growth of a silica shell through monolayers, followed by the selective removal of the metal core either using sodium cyanide or by a new reaction involving halocarbons. The material is stable and can be stored for extended periods without loss of fluorescence. Spectroscopic and voltammetric properties of the system were studied in order to understand the interaction of aniline with the shell as well as the monolayer, whilst transmission electron microscopy has been used to study the silica shell.</p>

These molecules exhibit significant bathochromic shift in their emission bands with decreased quantum yields relative to their corresponding \textit{meso} -tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives. The crystal structure of 5,10,15,20-\textit{tetrakis}(3'-thienyl)porphinato zinc(II) shows planar and nonplanar stereochemical features of the macrocycle. One of the macrocycle shows nearly planar while the other exhibited predominantly saddle-shaped geometry. The extent of displacement of the $\beta$-pyrrole carbons in the nonplanar (saddle) conformation is as high as $\pm 0\cdot 422$ &#197;.</p>

The nitrite complexes are useful synthons of electrophilic nitrosyls, and on triturating the dinitro compounds with conc. HClO$_4$, nitro-nitrosyl derivatives are isolated. The solution structure and stereoretentive transformation in each step have been established from ${}^1$H NMR results. The compounds are redox active and display one metal-centred oxidation and successive ligand-based reductions. The $v$ (NO) &gt;1900 cm$^{–1}$ strongly suggests the presence of linear Ru–N–O bonding. The electrophilic behaviour of metal-bound nitrosyl has been proved in one case by reacting with a bicyclic ketone, camphor, containing an active methylene group and an arylhydrazone with an active methine group. Diazotization of primary aromatic amines with strongly electrophilic mononitrosyl complexes in acetonotrile and dichloromethane solutions has been thoroughly studied.</p>

				<page>0419-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A number of important aromatic carboxylic acids precursors, or intermediates in the syntheses of natural products, are converted into methyl esters and reduced to the corresponding primary alcohols using a sodium borohydride–THF–methanol system. The alcohols are obtained in 70–92&#37; yields in 2–5 hours, in a pure state. This two-step procedure not only provides a better alternative to aluminum hydride reduction of acids but also allows the selective reduction of esters in presence of acids, amides, nitriles or nitro functions which are not affected under these conditions.</p>

					<p>Competitive oxygenation of cyclooctene and tetralin with sodium periodate catalyzed by Mn$^{\text{(III)}}$(TPP)OAc, TPP = meso-tetraphenylporphyrin; Mn$^{\text{(III)}}$ (TNP)OAc, TNP = \textit{meso-tetrakis}(1-naphthyl) porphyrin; Mn$^{\text{(III)}}$ (TMP)OAc, TMP = \textit{meso-tetrakis}(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)porphyrin; Mn$^{\text{(III)}}$ (TDCPP)OAc, TDCPP = \textit{meso-tetrakis}(2,6-dichlorophenyl) porphyrin, and Mn$^{\textit{(III)}}$ (TPNMe$_2$-TFPP)OAc, TPNMe$_2$-TFPP = \textit{meso-tetrakis}(para-NMe$_2$-tetrafluorophenyl)porphyrin, was carried out in the presence or absence of imidazole. This study showed that, in the absence of imidazole, selectivity for epoxide formation was high with electron-rich catalysts such as Mn(TPP)OAc, Mn(TNP)OAc and Mn(TMP)OAc, but low with electron-deficient catalysts such as Mn(TDCPP)OAc and Mn(TPNMe$_2$-TFPP)OAc. Presumably, not only the axial ligation of imidazole to the four-coordinate Mn(III)-center, but also the steric and electronic influences of aryl-substituents on the porphyrin periphery affect the selectivity of the catalytic oxidation reaction.</p>

				<title>Photocleavage of DNA by copper(II) complexes</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0443-0453</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chemistry of ternary and binary copper(II) complexes showing efficient visible lightinduced DNA cleavage activity is summarized in this article. The role of the metal in photo-induced DNA cleavage reactions is explored by designing complex molecules having a variety of ligands. Ternary copper(II) complexes with amino acid like L-methionone or L-lysine and phenanthroline base are efficient photocleavers of DNA. Complexes of formulation [Cu(L$^n$)(phen)](ClO$_4$) with NSO-donor Schiff base (HL$^n$) and NN-donor heterocyclic base 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) show significant cleavage of supercoiled (SC) DNA on exposure to red light at $\approx$ 700 nm. The $d–d$ and CT electronic bands of the copper(II) complexes play important roles in DNA cleavage reactions. The mechanistic pathways are found to be dependent on the types of ligands present in the copper(II) complexes and the photo-excitation energy. While UV exposure generally proceeds via a type-II process forming singlet oxygen as the reactive species, red-light exposure leads to DNA cleavage following different mechanistic pathways, viz. type-I, type-II and photo-redox pathways. Ternary copper(II) complexes with phen as DNA binder and Schiff base with a thiomethyl group as photosensitizer, cleave SC DNA to its nicked circular (NC) form in a type-II process in red-light. The binary complex [Cu(dpq)$_2$(H$_2$O)](ClO$_4$)$_2$ (dpq, dipyridoquinoxaline) cleaves DNA by photo-redox pathway at 694 nm. The binuclear complex [Cu$^{\text{II}}_2$(RSSR)$_2$], where H$_2$RSSR is a Schiff base derived from 2-(thioethyl)salicylaldimine, cleaves SC DNA at 632$\cdot$8 nm (CW He–Ne laser) and 694 nm (ruby laser) involving sulphide (type-I process) and hydroxyl radicals (photo-redox pathway) as the reactive species.</p>

					<p>Phosphonate ligands, [RPO$_3$]$^{2–}$, are extremely versatile in the assembly of multi-tin and multi-copper architectures. We have used organostannoxane cores for supporting multi-ferrocene and multi-porphyrin peripheries.

Reaction of $t$-BuPO$_3$H$_2$ with Cu(ClO$_4$)$_2$. 6H$_2$O in the presence of 2-pyridylpyrazole (2-Pypz) leads to the synthesis of a decanuclear copper (II) assembly.</p>

				<title>Dioxygen reactivity of \textit{meso}-hydroxylated hemes: intermediates in heme degradation process catalyzed by heme oxygenase</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0463-0474</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heme oxygenase (HO) is the only enzyme in mammals known to catalyse the physiological degradation of unwanted heme into biliverdin, Fe ion and CO. The process involves introduction of the hydroxyl group at one of its \textit{meso}-positions as the first fundamental step of the heme cleavage process. It was also found that \textit{meso}-amino heme undergoes similar ring-cleavage process while reacting with dioxygen in presence of pyridine as an axial ligand. The present paper briefly reviews the reactions of model \textit{meso}-hydroxylated heme and its analogues with dioxygen, and their relevance in the heme degradation process.</p>

				<title>Utilization of LVO$^–_2$ species (L$^{2–}$ is a tridentate ONS donor) as an inorganic analogue of carboxylate group: A journey to a new domain of coordination chemistry</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0475-0486</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The anionic \textit{cis}-dioxovanadium (V) complex species LVO$^–_2$ of tridentate biprotic dithiocarbazatebased ligands H$_2$L ($S$-methyl-3-((5-R-2-hydroxyphenyl)methyl)dithiocabazate, R = H, L = L$^1$; and R = Br, L = L$^2$) can bind alkali metal ions. The products [LVO$_2$M(H$_2$O)$_n$] (M = Na$^+$, L = L$^1$, {\bf 1}; L = L$^2$, {\bf 2} and M = K$^+$, L = L$^1$, {\bf 3}) have extended chain structures in the solid state, stabilized by strong hydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions as revealed from X-ray crystallography. The LVO$^–_2$ moieties here behave like analogues of carboxylate groups and display interesting variations in their binding patterns. It appears that {\bf 1} is a single stranded helicate with LVO$^–_2$ units forming the strands which surround the labile sodium ions occupying positions on the axis. The compounds are stable in water and methanol as solvents, while in aprotic solvents of higher donor strengths, viz. CH$_3$CN, DMF and DMSO, they undergo photo-induced reduction when exposed to visible light, yielding green solutions from their initial yellow colour. The putative product is a mixed-oxidation ($\mu$-oxo)divanadium (IV/V) species as revealed from EPR, electronic spectroscopy, dynamic ${}^1$H NMR, and redox studies.</p>

					<p>Molecules in metal isonicotinate tetrahydrates, M(NC$_5$H$_4$-$p$-CO$_2$)$_2$.4H$_2$O with M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, consisting of the hexacoordinate complexes \textit{trans}-[M(NC$_5$H$_4$-$p$-CO$_2$)$_2$(OH$_2$)$_4$], participate in exhaustive hydrogen-bond formation among themselves to lead to a robust 3D supramolecular network in the solid state. Solid-state diffuse reflectance UV-Vis-NIR spectra of the complexes have been assigned to ligand field and charge transfer transitions. Sharp weight loss due to dehydration, as shown by TGA of Cu(NC$_5$H$_4$-$p$-CO$_2$)$_2$.4H$_2$O, suggests the suitability of this complex for the gravimetric estimation of copper.</p>

				<title>Structural models of vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases and their reactivity</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0503-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Vanadium(V) complexes with hydrazone-based ONO and ONN donor ligands that partly model active-site structures of vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases have been reported. On reaction with [VO(acac)$_2$] (Hacac = acetylacetone) under nitrogen, these ligands generally provide oxovanadium(IV) complexes [VO(ONO)X] (X = solvent or nothing) and [VO(acac)(ONN)], respectively. Under aerobic conditions, these oxovanadium(IV) species undergo oxidation to give oxovanadium(V), dioxovanadium (V) or $\mu$-oxo\textit{bis}$\{$oxovanadium(V)$\}$ species depending upon the nature of the ligand. Anionic and neutral dioxovanadium(V) complexes slowly deoxygenate in methanol to give monooxo complexes [VO(OMe)(MeOH)(ONO)]. The anionic complexes [VO$_2$(ONO)]$^–$ can also be converted in situ on acidification to oxohydroxo complexes [VO(OH)(HONO)]$^+$ and to peroxo complexes [VO(O$_2$)(ONO)]$^–$, and thus to the species assumed to be intermediates in the haloperoxidases activity of the enzymes. In the presence of catechol (H$_2$cat) and benzohydroxamic acid (H$_2$bha), oxovanadium (IV) complexes, [VO (acac)(ONN)] gave mixed-chelate oxovanadium(V) complexes [VO(cat)(ONN)] and [VO(bha)(ONN)] respectively. These complexes are not very stable in solution and slowly convert to the corresponding dioxo species [VO$_2$(ONN)] as observed by ${}^{51}$V NMR and electronic absorption spectroscopic studies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The preparation of inorganic compounds, exhibiting open-framework structures, by hydrothermal methods has been presented. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, few select examples encompassing a wide variety and diversity in the structures have been provided. In all the cases, good quality single crystals were obtained, which were used for the elucidation of the structure. In the first example, simple inorganic network compounds based on phosphite and arsenate are described. In the second example, inorganic–organic hybrid compounds involving phosphite/arsenate along with oxalate units are presented. In the third example, new coordination polymers with interesting structures are given. The examples presented are representative of the type and variety of compounds one can prepare by careful choice of the reaction conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A large number of polynuclear ruthenium complexes encompassing selective combinations of spacer (bridging ligand, {\bf BL}) and ancillary ({\bf AL}) functionalities have been designed. The extent of intermetallic electronic communication in mixed-valent states and the efficacy of the ligand frameworks towards the tuning of coupling processes have been scrutinised via structural, spectroelectrochemical, EPR, magnetic and theoretical investigations. Moreover, the sensitive oxidation state features in the complexes of non-innocent quinonoid bridging moieties have also been addressed.</p>

				<title>Synthesis and characterization of single-source molecular precursors for the preparation of metal chalcogenides</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0547-0552</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metal chalcogenides constitute an important family of functional materials. Subtle changes in shape, size and phase of these materials result in variations in physical properties (e.g. electronic and optical), which can be exploited for various technological applications. Several strategies have evolved recently for controlling shape, size and phase of these materials. This work discusses design and synthesis of single-source molecular precursors for the preparation of metal chalcogenides both in bulk and nano-size regime. Precursors for palladium chalcogenides, indium sulphides and {\bf II–VI} materials are presented. Synthesis of a variety of palladium({\bf II})/platinum({\bf II}) complexes with internally functionalised chalcogenolate ligands, selenocarboxylates; gallium and indium dithiolate complexes and zinc/cadmium/mercury complexes with N,N'-dimethylaminoalkylselenolate ligands and their characterization by NMR and X-ray crystallography are also discussed. Data on thermal behaviour of a few representative complexes, [Pd(SeCOAr)$_2$(PR$_3$)$_2$], [PdCl(E$^\cap$N)(PR$_3$)], [InMe$_2$(S$^\cap$S)], [In(S$^\cap$S)$_3$] and [M(E(CH$_2$)$_n$NMe$_2$)$_2$] (M = Zn, Cd, Hg; $n = 2$ or 3) are presented.</p>

				<title>Activation of peroxyl and molecular oxygen using \textit{bis}-benzimidazole diamide copper (II) compounds</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0553-0568</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New tetradentate bis-benzimidazole ligands have been synthesized and utilized to prepare copper (II) complexes. Some of these copper (II) complexes have been characterized structurally. The copper (II) in these complexes is found to possess varying geometries. A distorted octahedral geometry is found with a highly unsymmetrical bidentate nitrate group. An unusual polymeric one-dimensional structure is observed where copper (II) is in a distorted square pyramidal geometry with a monodentate nitrate ion, having long Cu–O bond, while a distorted triagonal bipyramidal geometry is found with two carbonyl O atoms and a Cl atom in the equatorial plane, and two benzimidazole imine N atoms occupy the axial position. These compounds are found to activate the cumylperoxyl group, and this has been utilized in the facile oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes, where they act as catalysts with large turnovers. The yields of the respective products vary from 32 to 65&#37;. The role of molecular oxygen has been studied and an attempt has been made to identify the "active copper species”. Activation of molecular oxygen has also been observed and has been used for oxidative dealkylation of a hindered phenol, producing di-butyl quinones with yields of 20–25&#37; and 10–12 fold catalytic turnover. Dihydroxybenzenes and substituted catechols are also readily oxidized to the corresponding quinones, in oxygen-saturated solvents. Yields of 84&#37; have been observed with 34-fold catalyst turnover, with di-$t$-butylcatechol. The activity of these copper (II) – \textit{bis}-benzmidazolediamide compounds is reminiscent of the functioning of copper centres in galactose oxidase, tyrosinase and catechol oxidase.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ground state geometry and electronic structure of M$^{2–}_4$ cluster (M = B, Al, Ga) have been investigated to evaluate their aromatic properties. The calculations are performed by employing the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. It is found that all these three clusters adopt square planar configuration. Results reveal that square planar M$^{2–}_4$ dianion exhibits characteristics of multifold aromaticity with two delocalised $\pi$-electrons. In spite of the unstable nature of these dianionic clusters in the gas phase, their interaction with the sodium atoms forms very stable dipyramidal M$_4$Na$_2$ complexes while maintaining their square planar structure and aromaticity.</p>

				<title>Snapshots of the "breaking” of the H–H bond in the oxidative addition of H$_2$ to a metal centre</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0579-0582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three new monocationic molecular hydrogen complexes of ruthenium of the type \textit{trans}-[RuCl($\eta^2$-H$_2$)(PP)$_2$][BF$_4$] (PP = \textit{bis}-1,2(diarylphosphino)ethane, aryl = $p$-fluorobenzyl, benzyl, $p$-methylbenzyl) have been prepared by protonating the precursor hydride complexes \textit{trans}-[RuCl(H)(PP)$_2$] using HBF$_4 \cdot $Et$_2$O. These three dihydrogen complexes are quite stable and have been isolated in the solid state. The intact nature of the H–H bond in these derivatives has been established from the short spin-lattice relaxation times ($T_1$, $ms$) and the observation of substantial H, D couplings in the HD isotopomers. The H–H bond distances ($d_{\rm{HH}}$, &#197;) increase from $0 \cdot 97$ to $1 \cdot 01$ &#197; as the electron donor ability of the diphosphine ligand increases from the $p$-fluorobenzyl to the benzyl to the $p$-methylbenzyl moiety. These dihydrogen complexes constitute the initial stages of elongation of the H–H bond enroute to its cleavage along the reaction coordinate for the oxidative addition of H$_2$ to a metal centre.</p>

				<title>Nanostructured metal particle-modified electrodes for electrocatalytic and sensor applications</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0593-0600</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nanotechnology has become one of the most exciting frontier fields in analytical chemistry. The huge interest in nanomaterials, for example in chemical sensors and catalysis, is driven by their many desirable properties. Although metal is a poor catalyst in bulk form, nanometre-sized particles can exhibit excellent catalytic activity due to their relative high surface area-to-volume ratio and their interface-dominated properties, which significantly differ from those of the bulk material. The integration of metal nanoparticles into thin film of permselective membrane is particularly important for various applications, for example in biological sensing and in electrocatalysis. We have already established different techniques to design permselective membrane-coated chemically modified electrodes with incorporated redox molecules for electrocatalytic, electrochromic and sensor applications. Recently, we have prepared nanostructured platinum and copper (represented M$_{\text{nano}}$, M = Pt and Cu) modified GC/Nafion electrodes (GC/Nf/M$_{\text{nano}}$) and characterized by using AFM, XPS, XRD and electrochemical techniques. The nanostructured M$_{\text{nano}}$ modified electrodes were utilized for efficient electrocatalytic selective oxidation of neurotransmitter molecules in the presence of interfering species such as ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). It has been also shown that the modified electrodes could be used as sensors for the detection of submicromolar concentrations of biomolecules with practical applications to real samples such as blood plasma and dopamine hydrochloride injection solution. The GC/Cu$_{\text{nano}}$ electrode has been used for catalytic reduction of oxygen.</p>

				<title>Iron(III) complexes of certain tetradentate phenolate ligands as functional models for catechol dioxygenases</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0601-0610</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (CTD) and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (PCD) are bacterial non-heme iron enzymes, which catalyse the oxidative cleavage of catechols to \textit{cis, cis}-muconic acids with the incorporation of molecular oxygen via a mechanism involving a high-spin ferric centre. The iron(III) complexes of tripodal phenolate ligands containing N$_3$O and N$_2$O$_2$ donor sets represent the metal binding region of the iron proteins. In our laboratory iron(III) complexes of mono- and bisphenolate ligands have been studied successfully as structural and functional models for the intradiol-cleaving catechol dioxygenase enzymes. The single crystal X-ray crystal structures of four of the complexes have been determined. One of the bis-phenolato complexes contains a FeN$_2$O$_2$Cl chromophore with a novel trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The Fe–O–C bond angle of $136\cdot 1^\circ$ observed for one of the iron(III) complex of a monophenolate ligand is very similar to that in the enzymes. The importance of the nearby sterically demanding coordinated –NMe$_2$ group has been established and implies similar stereochemical constraints from the other ligated amino acid moieties in the 3,4-PCD enzymes, the enzyme activity of which is traced to the difference in the equatorial and axial Fe–O(tyrosinate) bonds (Fe–O–C, 133, 148$^\circ$). The nature of heterocyclic rings of the ligands and the methyl substituents on them regulate the electronic spectral features, Fe$^{III}$/Fe$^{II}$ redox potentials and catechol cleavage activity of the complexes. Upon interacting with catecholate anions, two catecholate to iron(III) charge transfer bands appear and the low energy band is similar to that of catechol dioxygenase-substrate complex. Four of the complexes catalyze the oxidative cleavage of H$_2$DBC by molecular oxygen to yield intradiol cleavage products. Remarkably, the more basic N-methylimidazole ring in one of the complexes facilitates the rate-determining productreleasing phase of the catalytic reaction. The present study provides support to the novel substrate activation mechanism proposed for the intradiol-cleavage enzymes.</p>

Compound {\bf 1} crystallizes in the monoclinic space group $P21/c$ with $a = 13\cdot 433$(4), $b = 16\cdot 283$(5), $c = 15\cdot 072$(4) &#197;, $\beta = 107\cdot 785$(4)$^\circ$, $Z = 2$. In the crystal structure, the complex anion [Cu$^{II}$(mnt)$_2$]$^{2–}$ bridges two [Mn$^{III}$(salph)(H$_2$O)]$^{1+}$ cations through Mn$\cdots$S contacts. The non-covalent hydrogen bonding and $\pi-\pi$ interactions among the trinuclear [$\{Mn$^{III}$(salph)(H$_2$O)$\}_2\{$CuII(mnt)$_2\}$] complexes lead to an extended chain-like arrangement of [Mn$^{III}$(salph) (H$_2$O)]$^{1+}$ cations with [Cu$^{II}$(mnt)$_2$]$^{2–}$ anions embedded in between these chains.</p>

				<title>Thyroid hormone synthesis and anti-thyroid drugs: A bioinorganic chemistry approach</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry XI</feature>
				<page>0619-0625</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogen peroxide, generated by thyroid oxidase enzymes, is a crucial substrate for the thyroid peroxidase (TPO)-catalysed biosynthesis of thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid gland. It is believed that the H$_2$O$_2$ generation is a limiting step in thyroid hormone synthesis. Therefore, the control of hydrogen peroxide concentration is one of the possible mechanisms for the inhibition of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis is required for the treatment of hyperthyroidism and this can be achieved by one or more anti-thyroid drugs. The most widely used anti-thyroid drug methimazole (MMI) inhibits the production of thyroid hormones by irreversibly inactivating the enzyme TPO. Our studies show that the replacement of sulphur in MMI by selenium leads to a selone, which exists predominantly in its zwitterionic form. In contrast to the sulphur drug, the selenium analogue (MSeI) reversibly inhibits the peroxidase-catalysed oxidation and iodination reactions. Theoretical studies on MSeI reveal that the selenium atom in this compound carries a large negative charge. The carbon–selenium bond length in MSeI is found to be close to single-bond length. As the selenium atom exhibits a large nucleophilic character, the selenium analogue of MMI may scavenge the hydrogen peroxide present in the thyroid cells, which may lead to a reversible inhibition of thyroid hormone biosynthesis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reactions of IrCl$_3 \cdotx$H$_2$O with the ligands, 2-[(phenylamino)phenylazo]pyridine (HL$^{1a}$) and 2-[($p$-tolylamino)phenylazo]pyridine (HL$^{1b}$) produce [Ir(L$^1$)$_2$]Cl (L$^1$ = L$^{1a}$, [{\bf 1}]Cl and L$^1$ = L$^{1b}$, [{\bf 2}]Cl) along with many unidentified products. The iridium complexes have been characterized by various techniques such as X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, ${}^1$H and ${}^{13}$C NMR, cyclic voltammetry and absorption studies. The complex [{\bf 1}]ClO$_4$ crystallises in triclinic space group. The crystallographic data have been determined. Notably, the Ir–N (azo) lengths are short (av. $1 \cdot 9875$(4) &#197;) as compared to the remaining four Ir–N lengths (av. $2 \cdot 052$(5) &#197;). There is significant degree of ligand backbone conjugation in the coordinated ligands, which result in shortening of the C–N lengths on the other side of the middle phenyl ring and also in lengthening of the diazo (N=N) lengths. The complexes display multiple low energy transitions ranging between 1010 and 450 nm. These are electro active and show three reversible redox responses in the potential range, $+1\cdot 5 V to $–1\cdot 5$ V. The cathodic potential responses are ascribed as ligand reductions, while the redox process at the anodic potential occurs at a mixed metal–ligand (HOMO) orbital.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, spectroscopy, thermal studies and supramolecular structures of two new alkali-earth 4-nitrobenzoate complexes containing coordinated imidazole</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0011-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of hydrated magnesium or calcium 4-nitrobenzoate (4-nba) generated \textit{in situ}, with imidazole (Im) results in the formation of the complexes [Mg(H$_2$O)$_2$(Im)$_2$(4-nba)$_2$] {\bf 1} and [Ca(H$_2$O)$_3$(Im)(4-nba)$_2$]$\cdot$Im {\bf 2}, which exhibit the same metal:4-nba:Im ratio but different degrees of hydration. Complex {\bf 1} crystallizes in the triclinic $P_{\bar{i}}$ space group and the Mg atom is located on an inversion centre, while {\bf 2} crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group and all atoms are located in general positions. In {\bf 1} the Im ligands, which are trans to each other, are coordinated to Mg, while {\bf 2} contains coordinated as well as free Im. The monodentate 4-nba ligands are disposed \textit{trans} to each other in {\bf 1}, while they adopt a \textit{cis} orientation in {\bf 2} resulting in different supramolecular structures. Complex 1 exhibits two types of H-bonding interactions namely O–H$\Lambda$O and N–H$\Lambda$O, while in {\bf 2} three varieties of H-bond, viz. O-H$\Lambda$O, N–H$\Lambda$O and O–H$\Lambda$N are observed. The Im ligand functions as a bifurcated H-bond donor in {\bf 1} while the O atom of the nitro group functions as a H-bond acceptor. In contrast, the nitro group in {\bf 2} is not involved in any H-bonding interactions. The free Im in {\bf 2} functions as a bifurcated acceptor and forms an extended chain linking adjacent complex molecules. The chains thus formed are further cross-linked with the aid of H-donor bonds from both the free as well as the coordinated Im. Both {\bf 1} and {\bf 2} exhibit $\pi–\pi$ stacking interactions. Complex {\bf 1} is thermally more stable as compared to {\bf 2}, and both complexes can be dehydrated to the corresponding anhydrous complexes by heating at 140 and 100$^\circ$C respectively. At elevated temperatures, both the complexes can be pyrolysed to the corresponding oxide. The anhydrous complexes can be rehydrated to obtain the starting hydrated materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of benzyl chloride with tetramethylethylenediamine (tmen) results in the formation of the quaternary diammonium dichloride trihydrate (dbtmen)Cl$_2$⋅3H$_2$O {\bf 1} (dbtmen is N,N'-dibenzyl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediammonium) in good yields. {\bf 1} crystallises in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group and its structure consists of N,N'-dibenzyl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediammonium dication, two chloride anions and three crystal water molecules all of which are located in general positions. The organic dication is H-bonded to the chloride anions and the crystal waters with the help of intra- and intermolecular C–H$\cdots$Cl and C–H$\cdots$O interactions, while the chloride anions are linked to the crystal waters via O–H$\cdots$Cl interactions. One of the crystal waters is linked through an intermolecular O–H$\cdots$O bond with another water resulting in the formation of a water dimer. The O–H$\cdots$Cl and O–H$\cdots$O interactions between the chloride anions and water molecules lead to the formation of a five-membered $\{$O$_3$Cl$_2\}$ cyclic dichloride containing a water dimer. The five-membered rings are linked into a chain with the aid of a O–H$\cdots$Cl interaction. The organic cations are organised in zigzag fashion on either side of the chain and are further linked to the anionic water chain via weak C–H$\cdos$O and C–H$\cdots$Cl interactions, leading to the supramolecular organisation of the rings into a spiral-like of chain.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Spectroscopic characterization (IR, NMR and electronic spectra) of methyl (ligand) cobaloxime was done, where ligand = pyrazole, dimethyl pyrazole, alanine and alanine methyl ester. The frequency changes in the IR spectra and shifts in the NMR were explained on the basis of basicity of the ligand, steric hindrance, HSAB principle and $d\pi–p\pi$ back-bonding from metal to ligand. Alanine and alanine methyl ester form more stable complexes than pyrazole and dimethyl pyrazole. Based on their IR and ${}^1$H NMR spectra it is inferred that pyrazole and dimethylpyrazole bind to Co (III) via N–2 ring nitrogen, i.e. monodentate coordination.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>M(IV) phosphates of the class of tetravalent metal acid (TMA) salts where M (IV) = Zr, Ti, Sn has been synthesized by the sol–gel method. These materials have been characterized for elemental analysis (ICP-AES), thermal analysis (TGA, DSC), X-ray analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. Chemical resistivity of these materials has been accessed in acidic, basic and organic solvent media. The protons present in the structural hydroxyl groups indicates good potential for TMA salts to exhibit solid-state proton conduction. The transport properties of these materials has been explored by measuring specific proton conductance at different temperatures in the range of 30–120$^\circ$C at 10$^\circ$C intervals, using a Solartron Dataset impedance analyzer (SI 1260) over a frequency range 1 Hz–10 MHz at a signal level below 1 V. Based on the specific conductance data and the Arrhenius plots, a suitable mechanism has been proposed and conductance performance of ZrP, SnP and TiP compared.</p>

				<title>Identification of intermediate species in protein-folding by quantitative analysis of amplitudes in time-domain fluorescence spectroscopy</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0061-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In protein-folding studies it is often required to differentiate a system with only two-states, namely the native (N) and unfolded (U) forms of the protein present at any condition of the solvent, from a situation wherein intermediate state(s) could also be present. This differentiation of a two-state from a multi-state structural transition is non-trivial when studied by the several steady-state spectroscopic methods that are popular in protein-folding studies. In contrast to the steady-state methods, time-resolved fluorescence has the capability to reveal the presence of heterogeneity of structural forms due to the `fingerprint’ nature of fluorescence lifetimes of various forms. In this work, we establish this method by quantitative analysis of amplitudes associated with fluorescence lifetimes in multiexponential decays. First, we show that we can estimate, accurately, the relative population of species from two-component mixtures of non-interacting molecules such as fluorescent dyes, peptides and proteins. Subsequently, we demonstrate, by analysing the amplitudes of fluorescence lifetimes which are controlled by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), that the equilibrium folding–unfolding transition of the small singledomain protein barstar is not a two-step process.</p>

					<p>Excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) of pyranine (8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulphonate, HPTS) to acetate in methanol has been studied by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The rate constant of direct proton transfer from pyranine to acetate ($k_1$) is calculated to be $\tilde 1  \times 10^9$ M$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$.

				<title>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer from tryptophan in human serum albumin to a bioactive indoloquinolizine system</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0077-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction between a bioactive molecule, 3-acetyl-4-oxo-6,7-dihydro-12H indolo-[2,3-a] quinolizine (AODIQ), with human serum albumin (HSA) has been studied using steady-state absorption and fluorescence techniques. A 1 : 1 complex formation has been established and the binding constant ($K$) and free energy change for the process have been reported. The AODIQ–HSA complex results in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the tryptophan moiety of HSA to the probe. The critical energy-transfer distance ($R_0$) for FRET and the Stern–Volmer constant ($K_{sv}$) for the fluorescence quenching of the donor in the presence of the acceptor have been determined. Importantly, $K_{SV}$ has been shown to be equal to the binding constant itself, implying that the fluorescence quenching arises only from the FRET process. The study suggests that the donor and the acceptor are bound to the same protein at different locations but within the quenching distance.</p>

				<title>Effects of polar protic solvents on dual emissions of 3-hydroxychromones</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0083-0089</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>3-Hydroxychromones (3HC), exhibit dual emissions highly sensitive to solvent properties due to excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Therefore, 3HCs find wide applications as fluorescence probes in biological systems. Here, it is particularly important to understand the fluorescence behaviour of 3HCs in polar environments. Herein, we studied 3-hydroxyflavone, 2-(2-furyl)-3-hydroxychromone and 2-(2-benzofuryl)-3-hydroxychromone in high polarity solvents characterized by different H-bond donor abilities, donor concentrations and acceptor abilities. Our results show that the dual emissions of the dyes are insensitive to solvent basicity but strongly depend on the two other parameters. Moreover, furyl- and benzofuryl-substituted dyes were significantly more sensitive than the 3-hydroxyflavone to H-bond donor ability, while all three dyes showed roughly equivalent high sensitivity to H-bond donor concentration. These results can be explained by different mechanisms. Thus, the sensitivity of all three dyes to increasing concentrations of H-bond donors probably results from increase in the population of solvated dye with disrupted intramolecular H-bonds. Meantime, the sensitivity to Hbond donor ability of the solvent, observed mainly with furyl and benzofuryl dyes, is probably related to the strength of the H-bonds between the solvent and the 4-carbonyl group of the dye with intact intramolecular H-bonds. The present results provide new insights for further applications of 3HC derivatives as environment-sensitive probes and labels of biological molecules.</p>

				<title>Ratiometric fluorescence signalling of fluoride ions by an amidophthalimide derivative</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0091-0097</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence behaviour of 4-benzoylamido-N-methylphthalimide ({\bf 1}), designed and developed for selective detection of fluoride ions, is reported. {\bf 1} displays $F^–$-induced colour change that allows its detection with the naked eye. The $F^–$ specificity of the sensor system is evident from the fact that unlike $F^–$, other halides do not affect the absorption characteristics of {\bf 1}. Apart from the colorimetric response, the fluorescence output of {\bf 1} is also modulated by $F^–$ in a manner that permits ratiometric fluorescence signalling of $F^–$ as well. It is found that the system can detect $F^–$ in the concentration range of $10^–$ 60 $\mu$M. The results of the experiments and theoretical calculations unambiguously suggest that the changes of the electronic absorption and fluorescence behaviour of {\bf 1}, which have been exploited for signalling purpose, are due to $F^–$-induced deprotonation of the 4-amido moiety of the sensor system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we have reported the solvent and rotational relaxation of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([bmim][PF$_6$]) confined in tween 20/([bmim][PF$_6$]/water microemulsion using coumarin 153 (C-153) as probe. The most interesting feature of our experiment was that we observed an increase in solvent relaxation time with increase in $R$ ($R$ = tween 20-to-[bmim][PF$_6$] molar ratio). This is due to the fact that with increase in [bmim][PF$_6$] content of the microemulsions, the microviscosity of the pool of the microemulsions increases, and motion of ions of [bmim][PF$_6$] is hindered in the pool of microemulsions. Since motion of ions is responsible for solvation in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), solvent-relaxation time increases with increase in $R$.</p>

				<title>On the origin of the anomalous ultraslow solvation dynamics in heterogeneous environments</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0113-0121</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many recent experimental studies have reported a surprising ultraslow component (even &gt;10 ns) in the solvation dynamics of a polar probe in an organized assembly, the origin of which is not understood at present. Here we propose two molecular mechanisms in explanation. The first one involves the motion of the `buried water’ molecules (both translation and rotation), accompanied by cooperative relaxation (‘local melting’) of several surfactant chains. An estimate of the time is obtained by using an effective Rouse chain model of chain dynamics, coupled with a mean first passage time calculation. The second explanation invokes self-diffusion of the (di)polar probe \textit{itself} from a less polar to a more polar region. This may also involve cooperative motion of the surfactant chains in the hydrophobic core, if the probe has a sizeable distribution inside the core prior to excitation, or escape of the probe to the bulk from the surface of the self-assembly. The second mechanism should result in the \textit{narrowing of the full width of the emission spectrum with time}, which has indeed been observed in recent experiments. It is argued that both the mechanisms may give rise to an ultraslow time constant and may be applicable to different experimental situations. The effectiveness of solvation as a dynamical probe in such complex systems has been discussed.</p>

				<title>Time-resolved fluorescence analysis of the mobile flavin cofactor in $p$-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0123-0133</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Conformational heterogeneity of the FAD cofactor in $p$-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) was investigated with time-resolved polarized flavin fluorescence. For binary enzyme/substrate (analogue) complexes of wild-type PHBH and Tyr222 mutants, crystallographic studies have revealed two distinct flavin conformations; the `in’ conformation with the isoalloxazine ring located in the active site, and the `out’ conformation with the isoalloxazine ring disposed towards the protein surface. Fluorescence-lifetime analysis of these complexes revealed similar lifetime distributions for the `in’ and `out’ conformations. The reason for this is twofold. First, the active site of PHBH contains various potential fluorescence-quenching sites close to the flavin. Fluorescence analysis of uncomplexed PHBH Y222V and Y222A showed that Tyr222 is responsible for picosecond fluorescence quenching free enzyme. In addition, other potential quenching sites, including a tryptophan and two tyrosines involved in substrate binding, are located nearby. Since the shortest distance between these quenching sites and the isoalloxazine ring differs only little on average, these aromatic residues are likely to contribute to fluorescence quenching. Second, the effect of flavin conformation on the fluorescence lifetime distribution is blurred by binding of the aromatic substrates: saturation with aromatic substrates induces highly efficient fluorescence quenching. The flavin conformation is therefore only reflected in the small relative contributions of the longer lifetimes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Gramicidins are linear peptides that form ion channels that are specific for monovalent cations in membranes. The tryptophan residues in the gramicidin channel play a crucial role in the organization and function of the channel. The natural mixture of gramicidins, denoted as gramicidin A', consists of mostly gramicidin A, but also contains gramicidins B, C and D as minor components. We have previously shown that the tryptophan residues in ion channels formed by the naturally occurring peptide, gramicidin A', display wavelength-dependent fluorescence characteristics due to the motionally restricted environment in which they are localized. In order to check the influence of ground-state heterogeneity in the observed wavelength-selective fluorescence of gramicidin A' in membranes, we performed similar experiments with pure gramicidin A in model membranes. Our results show that the observed wavelength-selective fluorescence characteristics of naturally occurring gramicidin A' are not due to groundstate heterogeneity.</p>

				<title>Employing the fluorescence anisotropy and quenching kinetics of tryptophan to hunt for residual structures in denatured proteins</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0141-0145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Residual structures in denatured proteins have acquired importance in recent years owing to their role as protein-folding initiation sites. Locating these structures in proteins has proved quite formidable, requiring techniques like NMR. Here in this report, we take advantage of the ubiquitous presence of tryptophan residues in residual structures to hunt for their presence using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. The surface accessibility and rotational dynamics of tryptophan in putative residual structures among ten different proteins, namely glucagon, melittin, subtilisin carlsberg, myelin basic protein, ribonuclease T$_1$, human serum albumin, barstar mutant, bovine serum albumin, lysozyme and Trp–Met–Asp–Phe–NH$_2$ peptide, was studied using steady state fluorescence quenching and anisotropy, respectively. Five proteins, namely ribonuclease T$_1$, bovine serum albumin, melittin, barstar and hen egg white lysozyme appear likely to possess tryptophan(s) in hydrophobic clusters based on their reduced bimolecular quenching rates and higher steady-state anisotropy in proportion to their chain length. We also show that the fluorescence emission maximum of tryptophan is insensitive to the presence of residual structures.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0147-0159</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes our ongoing efforts to understand dynamical processes such as rotational diffusion and photoisomerization in polymorphic environments of a block copolymer. The objective is to explore how the typical properties of a block copolymer solution such as critical micelle temperature (CMT) and temperature-induced sol–gel transition influence the rotational diffusion of hydrophobic solute molecules. Rotational diffusion of solute molecules differs significantly below and above the CMT of a block copolymer solution, while there is no influence of sol–gel transition on solute rotation. This is rationalized on the basis of the site of solubilization of the solute molecules which is the palisade layer of the micelles in both phases and unaffected by gelation. A similar result has been obtained in case of photoisomerization studies carried out with a carbocyanine derivative in the sol and gel phases of the block copolymer. The isomerization studies have been extended to the reverse phases (sol and gel phases) of the block copolymer to explore the nature of the water present in the cores of the reverse micelles. Our results provide evidence for the existence of water droplets with properties resembling bulk water. In essence, we show that despite having vastly differing bulk properties, both the solution and gel phases (normal as well as reverse) offer identical microscopic environment.</p>

The difference between fluorescence anisotropy decays recorded at 460 nm when exciting at 250 nm and those obtained when exciting at 394 nm are reported. When exciting at 394 nm, the fluorescence anisotropy decay is bi-exponential, while on exciting at 250 nm a mono-exponential fluorescence anisotropy decay is observed.

				<abstract>
					<p>Effects of two bile salts, namely sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) and sodium cholate (NaC), on DPPC small unilamellar vesicles have been investigated using the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy ($r_{ss}$) of diphenylhexatriene (DPH) as a tool. It was found that the variation of $r_{ss}$ is sensitive enough to monitor different stages of interaction of bile salts with DPPC vesicles. NaDC induced significant changes in the membrane well below its CMC (6 mM). Even at 4 mM, which is still lower than the CMC, the phospholipids were completely solubilised by the NaDC micelles. The effect of NaC on DPPC vesicles, however, was much less significant, especially in the sub-micellar concentration regime. Being more hydrophilic NaC does not interact with the membrane efficiently. Complete solubilisation of phospholipids took place only when the concentration of NaC was above its CMC (16 mM). The experiments also showed that the bile salt-induced changes of vesicle structure were strongly dependent on the concentration of the bile salt and not on the molar ratio of lipid and bile salt.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0175-0183</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comparative time-resolved emission studies of several naphtho-crown ethers {\bf I–V}, where metal ions can be complexed in a predetermined orientation with respect to the naphthalene (Naph) $\pi$- plane and naphthalene-linked aza crown ethers (L1 and L2) have been presented. In both the systems, crown ethers and aza crown ethers, naphthalene fluorescence gets quenched. In the systems {\bf I} to {\bf V}, the quenching is mainly due to efficient spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leading to greater population of the lowest triplet state of naphthalene. This SOC depends on the orientation of the crown ring with respect to the Naph-$\pi$-plane. However, in the systems L1 and L2, the quenching is due to photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from nitrogen lone pair of the aza crown ring to naphthalene moiety and consequent exciplex formation. The results have been interpreted using the time-resolved emission studies of all the compounds in various solvents, their alkali metal ion complexes, and protonated ligands.</p>

				<title>Effect of surfactants on the fluorescence spectra of water-soluble MEHPPV derivatives having grafted polyelectrolyte chains</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Fluorescence Spectroscopy and its Applications</feature>
				<page>0185-0193</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Poly(2-methoxy-5-[2'-ethylhexyoxy]-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEHPPV) derivatives with polyacrylic acid (PAA) chains grafted onto their backbone were found to be water soluble, and they exhibited a dramatic increase in their fluorescence intensity in the presence of a variety of surfactants, even at concentrations far below their critical micelle concentrations (CMC). This increase was accompanied by a blue-shift in the emission maximum. These observations are rationalized based on the postulate that the backbone conformation of the conjugated polymer is modulated upon interaction of the surfactant molecules with the polyelectrolytic tethers, which in turn results in a significant depletion of intra-chain interchromophore interactions that are known to cause red-shifted emission bands with significantly lower emission yields.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photoinduced intramolecular charge-transfer reactions in 4-amino-3-methyl benzoic acid methyl ester (AMBME) have been investigated spectroscopically. AMBME, with its weak charge donor primary amino group, shows dual emission in polar solvents. Absorption and emission measurements in the condensed phase support the premise that the short wavelength emission band corresponds to local emission and the long wavelength emission band to the charge transfer emission. Laser-induced fluorescence excitation spectra show the presence of two low-energy conformers in jet-cooled molecular beams. Theoretical calculations using density functional theory help to determine structure, vibrational modes, potential energy surface, transition energy and oscillator strength for correlating experimental findings with theoretical results.</p>

				<title>Effect of strong coupling on interfacial electron transfer dynamics in dye-sensitized TiO$_2$ semiconductor nanoparticles</title>

				<page>0205-0215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dynamics of interfacial electron transfer (ET) in ruthenium polypyridyl complex [$\{$bis-(2,2'-bpy)-(4-[2-(4'-methyl-[2,2']bipyridinyl-4-yl)-vinyl]-benzene-1,2-diol)$\}$ruthenium(II) hexafluorophosphate] (Ru-cat) and 5,10,15-\textit{tris} phenyl-20-(3,4-dihydroxy benzene) porphyrin (TPP-cat)-sensitized TiO$_2$ nanoparticles have been investigated using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopic detection in the visible and near-infrared region. We have observed that both Ru-cat and TPP-cat are coupled strongly with the TiO$_2$ nanoparticles through their pendant catechol moieties. We have observed a single exponential and pulse-width limited (&lt;100 fs) electron injection from nonthermalized-excited states of Ru-complex. Here electron injection competes with the singlet–triplet manifold relaxation due to strong coupling of catecholate binding, which is a unique observation.</p>
					<p>Optical absorption measurements indicate that the catechol moiety interacts with TiO$_2$ nanoparticles showing the characteristic pure catechol-TiO$_2$ charge-transfer (CT) band in the visible region. Transient absorption studies on TPP-cat/TiO$_2$ system exciting both the Soret band at 400 nm and the Q-band at 800 nm have been carried out to determine excitation wavelength-dependence on ET dynamics. The reaction channel for the electron-injection process has been found to be different for both the excitation wavelengths. Excitation at 800 nm, is found directly populate directly the excited CT state from where diffusion of electrons into the conduction band takes place. On the other hand, excitation at 400 nm light excites both the CT band of cat-TiO$_2$ and also Soret band of TPP-cat.</p>

				<page>0219-0230</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The design and synthesis of figure–eight macrocycles are very scarce owing to the intricacies and lack of predictability from first principles. This review emphasizes on discrete macrocyclic systems both synthetic and natural with a defined figure eight knotted topology. In almost all the helical macrocycles, the helical arrangement is held by intramolecular hydrogen bonding or as a backbone requirement, but in all cases, a planar graph can be drawn and so these compounds are trivial from the topological stand point. Nature presents great deal of complexity in terms of structures in macromolecules like DNA and proteins and also displays intriguing topology in simple natural products. Patellamide, tawicyclamides, nosiheptide and thiostrepton are natural products with figure eight topology which shows interesting biological activity. Expanded porphyrins, Cu(II) complexes of thiomacrocycles, cyclic peptides and oligoesters are synthetic macrocycles showing intriguing topology. Analysis of structure and folding behaviour will enable chemists to design molecules with intriguing topology.</p>

The properties of these porous materials such as crystal structures, particle sizes, surface patterns, pore size, surface area and pore volume were characterized by X-ray diffraction( XRD), scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and BET measurements. The results indicated that all porous materials are of the perovskite-type complex oxides. Doping Sr$^{2+}$ ions on site A and doping Ni$^{2+}$ ions on site B entered the crystal lattices of LaCoO$_3$ in the place of La$^{3+}$ and Co$^{3+}$, respectively, and the maximum peak of XRD patterns of doping sample was weaken and broaden. Morphological microscopy demonstrated agglomerates involved mostly thin smooth flakes and layers perforated by a large number of pores and its lamella decreased with the introduction of Sr$^{2+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$. Hysteresis loop in the N$^{2}$ adsorption-desorption isotherm of samples indicated its porous structures and the doping effect on its pore size, surface area and pore volume were improved. The porous catalysts have been tested for methane catalytic combustion and the results showed that these catalysts possessed high catalytic activity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The aqueous reaction of [Mg(H$_2$O)$_6$]Cl$_2$ with the \textit{in situ} generated sodium salt of 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nbaH) and N-methylimidazole (N-MeIm) results in the formation of the dinuclear complex [Mg(H$_2$O)(N-MeIm)$_2$(4-nba)$_2$]$_2$ {\bf 1} (4-nba = 4-nitro benzoate), while the direct reaction of [Mg(H$_2$O)$_6$]Cl$_2$ with sodium 4-nba leads to the formation of the mononuclear complex, [Mg(H$_2$O)$_6$](4-nba)$_2$⋅2H2O {\bf 2}. In the centrosymmetric dimer {\bf 1}, each Mg atom is coordinated to an aquo ligand, two monodentate N-MeIm ligands and a monodentate 4-nba ligand. The second 4-nba ligand functions as a bridging bidentate ligand, linking the metal centers and completes the hexacoordination around each Mg(II). The dimeric molecules of {\bf 1} are linked into a one-dimensional chain along $b$ with the aid of intra- as well as intermolecular H-bonding interactions between the coordinated water and the free oxygen atom of the monodentate 4-nba ligand. In the mononuclear complex [Mg(H$_2$O)$_6$](4-nba)$_2$⋅2H$_2$O {\bf 2}, the Mg(II) is located on an inversion center and its structure consists of an octahedral [Mg(H$_2$O)$_6$]$^{2+}$ dication, a free uncoordinated 4-nba anion and a lattice water molecule. One of the H atoms attached of the lattice water is disordered over two positions. The hexaaquomagnesium(II) dication, the 4-nba anion and the lattice water molecule are linked by intra- and intermolecular H-bonding interactions resulting in the formation of alternating layers of [Mg(H$_2$O)$_6$]$^{2+}$ dications and 4-nba anions in the crystallographic $bc$ plane. The lattice water molecules are situated between the cations, while the 4-nba anions are arranged antiparallel to each other along $b$.</p>

					<p>Isomerization of all-\textit{trans}-$\beta$-carotene occurs during shaking with 0⋅5&#37; of titanium tetrachloride catalyst in methylene chloride at room temperature. In the present study we compared two types of columns C18 and C30 and various solvent systems for the separation of $\beta$-carotene and its \textit{cis} isomers by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that $\beta$-carotene isomers were resolved by employing a C30 column with a mobile phase of methanol (100&#37;) (A) and methylene chloride (100&#37;) (B) under a gradient elution condition. A total of eleven \textit{cis} isomers and one all-\textit{trans}-$\beta$-carotene isomer were resolved within 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and detection wave-length of 470 nm.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0277-0282</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The collision-free, room temperature gas-phase photodissociation dynamics of CH$_3$CFCl$_2$ (HCFC-141b) was studied using Lyman-$\alpha$ laser radiation ($121 \cdot 6$ nm) by the laser photolysis/laserinduced fluorescence `pump/probe’ technique. Lyman-$\alpha$ radiation was used both to photodissociate the parent molecule and to detect the nascent H atom products via ($2p^$2P $\rightarrow$ $1s^2$S) laser-induced fluorescence. Absolute H atom quantum yield, $\phi_H = (0⋅39 \pm 0⋅09)$ was determined by calibration method in which CH$_4$ photolysis at $121 \cdot 6$ nm was used as a reference source of well-defined H atom concentrations. The line shapes of the measured H atom Doppler profiles indicate a Gaussian velocity distribution suggesting the presence of indirect H atom formation pathways in the Lyman-$\alpha$ photodissociation of CH$_3$CFCl$_2$. The average kinetic energy of H atoms calculated from Doppler profiles was found to be $E_{\text{T(lab)}} = (50 \pm  3)$ kJ/mol. The nearly statistical translational energy together with the observed Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution indicates that for CH$_3$CFCl$_2$ the H atom forming dissociation process comes closer to the statistical limit.</p>

				<title>Electrochemical oxidation of substituted benzylamines in aquo-acetic acid medium: substituent and solvent effects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0289-0294</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrochemical oxidation of nine \textit{para}- and \textit{meta}-substituted benzylamines in varying mole fractions of acetic acid in water has been investigated in the presence of $0\cdot 1$ M sulphuric acid as supporting electrolyte. The oxidation potentials correlate well with Hammett’s substituent constants affording negative reaction constants. The correlation of potential values with macroscopic solvent parameters is non-linear suggesting that the operation of both specific and non-specific solvent–solvent–solute interaction mechanisms. Multiple correlation analysis of the experimental data with Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic parameters is employed.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, spectral characterization of Schiff base transition metal complexes: DNA cleavage and antimicrobial activity studies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0303-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new series of transition metal complexes of Cu(II), Ni(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), VO(IV), Hg(II) and Cd(II) have been synthesized from the Schiff base (L) derived from 4-aminoantipyrine, 3-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzaldehyde and $o$-phenylenediamine. Structural features were obtained from their elemental analyses, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance, mass, IR, UV–Vis, ${}^1$H NMR and ESR spectral studies. The data show that these complexes have composition of ML type. The UV–Vis, magnetic susceptibility and ESR spectral data of the complexes suggest a square–planar geometry around the central metal ion except VO(IV) complex which has square–pyramidal geometry. The redox behaviour of copper and vanadyl complexes was studied by cyclic voltammetry. Antimicrobial screening tests gave good results in the presence of metal ion in the ligand system. The nuclease activity of the above metal complexes shows that Cu, Ni and Co complexes cleave DNA through redox chemistry whereas other complexes are not effective.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The di- and trialkyltin(IV) complexes of composition R$_2$SnCl$_{2–x}$(OAr), and $n$-Bu$_3$Sn(OAr) (R = $n$-Bu and Me; $x = 1$ and 2; OAr = OC$_6$H$_3$Bu$^t$-2-Me-4) have been synthesized by the reactions of di-n-butyl and dimethyltin dichlorides and tri-n-butyltin(IV) chloride with 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol and triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran. The reaction of triphenyltin chloride with trimethylsilyl-2-t-butyl-4-methylphenoxide in the same solvent however, gives a complex of composition Ph$_3$Sn(OAr). The complexes have been characterized by microanalyses, molar conductance measurements, molecular weight determinations and IR and ${}^1$H, ${}^{13}$C and ${}^{119}$Sn NMR and mass spectral studies. Thermal behaviour of the complexes has been studied by TGA and DTA techniques. From the non-isothermal TG data, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters have been calculated employing Coats–Redfern equation and the mechanism of decomposition has been computed using non-isothermal kinetic method. Thermal investigations on the blends of poly(methylmethacrylate). PMMA, with organotin(IV)-2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxides have shown increased thermal stability compared to pure PMMA suggesting thereby their potential as additives towards PMMA.</p>

				<title>Study on the preparation and formation mechanism of barium sulphate nanoparticles modified by different organic acids</title>

				<page>0319-0324</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports a simple method to prepare barium sulphate nanoparticles by use of tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid and stearic acid as modifier. The barium sulphate nanoparticles obtained are characterized by using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT–IR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic laser light scatter (DLLS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The results show that the BaSO$_4$ particles are all spherical and in the nano-scale. Our method has a better dispersion and controllable diameter dependent on the length of the chain of organic acid and the pH value of the system. A possible mechanism is also discussed.</p>

				<title>Time-dependent quantum fluid density functional theory of hydrogen molecule under intense laser fields</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0335-0341</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A time-dependent generalized non-linear Schrödinger equation (GNLSE) of motion was earlier derived in our laboratory by combining density functional theory and quantum fluid dynamics in threedimensional space. In continuation of the work reported previously, the GNLSE is applied to provide additional knowledge on the femtosecond dynamics of the electron density in the hydrogen molecule interacting with high-intensity laser fields. For this purpose, the GNLSE is solved numerically for many time-steps over a total interaction time of 100 fs, by employing a finite-difference scheme. Various time-dependent (TD) quantities, namely, electron density, ground-state survival probability and dipole moment have been obtained for two laser wavelengths and four different intensities. The high-order harmonics generation (HHG) is also examined. The present approach goes beyond the linear response formalism and, in principle, calculates the TD electron density to all orders of change.</p>

				<title>Orientational dynamics and energy landscape features of thermotropic liquid crystals: An analogy with supercooled liquids</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0343-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent optical kerr effect (OKE) studies have revealed that orientational relaxation of rodlike nematogens near the isotropic-nematic (I–N) phase boundary and also in the nematic phase exhibit temporal power law decay at intermediate times. Such behaviour has drawn an intriguing analogy with supercooled liquids. Here, we have investigated the single-particle and collective orientational dynamics of a family of model system of thermotropic liquid crystals using extensive computer simulations. Several remarkable features of glassy dynamics are on display including non-exponential relaxation, dynamical heterogeneity, and non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the orientational relaxation time. Over a temperature range near the I–N phase boundary, the system behaves like a fragile glass-forming liquid. Using proper scaling, we construct the usual relaxation time versus inverse temperature plot and explicitly demonstrate that one can successfully define a density dependent fragility of liquid crystals. The fragility of liquid crystals shows a temperature and density dependence which is remarkably similar to the fragility of glass forming supercooled liquids. Energy landscape analysis of inherent structures shows that the breakdown of the Arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation rate occurs at a temperature that marks the onset of the growth of the depth of the potential energy minima explored by the system.</p>

					<p>The retarded interaction between an electron and a spin-0 nucleus, that has been derived from electro–dynamical perturbation theory is discussed here. A brief account of the derivation is given. The retarded form is correct through order $v^2/c^2$. Use of the relative coordinates leads to an effective oneelectron operator that can be used through all orders of perturbation theory. A few unitary transformations give rise to the interaction that is valid in the non-relativistic limit.</p>

				<title>Filled and empty states of carbon nanotubes in water: Dependence on nanotube diameter, wall thickness and dispersion interactions</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0367-0376</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have carried out a series of molecular dynamics simulations of water containing a narrow carbon nanotube as a solute to investigate the filling and emptying of the nanotube and also the modifications of the density and hydrogen bond distributions of water inside and also in the vicinity of the outer surfaces of the nanotube. Our primary goal is to look at the effects of varying nanotube diameter, wall thickness and also solute–solvent interactions on the solvent structure in the confined region also near the outer surfaces of the solute. The thickness of the walls is varied by considering single and multi-walled nanotubes and the interaction potential is varied by tuning the attractive strength of the 12–6 pair interaction potential between a carbon atom of the nanotubes and a water molecule. The calculations are done for many different values of the tuning parameter ranging from fully Lennard–Jones to pure repulsive pair interactions. It is found that both the solvation characteristics and hydrogen bond distributions can depend rather strongly on the strength of the attractive part of the solute–water interaction potential. The thickness of the nanotube wall, however, is found to have only minor effects on the density profiles, hydrogen bond network and the wetting characteristics. This indicates that the long range electrostatic interactions between water molecules inside and on the outer side of the nanotube do not make any significant contribution to the overall solvation structure of these hydrophobic solutes. The solvation characteristics are primarily determined by the balance between the loss of energy due to hydrogen bond network disruption, cavity repulsion potential and offset of the same by attractive component of the solute–water interactions. Our studies with different system sizes show that the essential features of wetting and dewetting characteristics of narrow nanotubes for different diameter and interaction potentials are also present in relatively smaller systems consisting of about five hundred molecules.</p>

				<title>Selective control of HOD photodissociation using CW lasers</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0377-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Selective control of HOD photodissociation (H–O $+$ D $\leftarrow$ HOD $\rightarrow$ H $+$ O–D) has been theoretically investigated using CW lasers with appropriate carrier frequency and |0, 0$\rangle$, |0, 1$\rangle$ and |0, 2$\rangle$ with zero quantum of excitation in the O–H bond and zero, one and two quanta of excitation in the O–D bond as the initial states. Results indicate that the O–H bond in HOD can be selectively dissociated with a maximum flux of 87&#37; in the H $+$ O–D channel from the ground vibrational state |0, 0$\rangle$. For the O–D bond dissociation, it requires two quanta of excitation (|0, 2$\rangle$) in the O–D mode to obtain 83&#37; flux in the H–O $+$ D channel. Use of a two colour laser set-up in conjunction with the field optimized initial state (FOIST) scheme to obtain an optimal linear combination of |0, 0$\rangle$ and |0, 1$\rangle$ vibrational states as the initial state provides an additional 7&#37; improvement to flux in the H–O $+$ D channel as compared to that from the pure |0, 1$\rangle$ state.</p>

				<title>Non-ideality in Born-free energy of solvation in alcohol–water and dimethylsulfoxide–acetonitrile mixtures: Solvent size ratio and ion size dependence</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0391-0399</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent extension of mean spherical approximation (MSA) for electrolyte solution has been employed to investigate the non-ideality in Born-free energy of solvation of a rigid, mono-positive ion in binary dipolar mixtures of associating (ethanol–water) and non-associating (dimethylsulfoxide–acetonitrile) solvents. In addition to the dipole moments, the solvent size ratio and ion size have been treated in a consistent manner in this extended MSA theory for the first time. The solvent–solvent size ratio is found to play an important role in determining the non-ideality in these binary mixtures. Smaller ions such as Li$^+$ and Na$^+$ show stronger non-ideality in such mixtures compared to bigger ions (for example, Cs$^+$ and Bu$_4$N$^+$). The partial solvent polarization densities around smaller ions in tertiary butanol (TBA)–water mixture is found to be very different from that in other alcohol–water mixtures as well as to that for larger ions in aqueous solutions of TBA. Non-ideality is weaker in mixtures consisting of solvent species possessing nearly equal diameters and dipole moments and is reflected in the mole fraction dependent partial solvent polarization densities.</p>

					<p>Reaction dynamics of prototypical, D $+$ H$_2$ and Cl (${}^2$P) $+$ H$_2$, chemical reactions occurring through the conical intersections of the respective coupled multi-sheeted potential energy surfaces is examined here. In addition to the electronic coupling, nonadiabatic effects due to relativistic spin-orbit coupling are also considered for the latter reaction.

				<abstract>
					<p>Contact transformation is an operator transformation method in time-independent perturbation theory which is used successfully in molecular spectroscopy to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Floquet theory is used to transform the periodic time-dependent Hamiltonian, to a time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian. In this article contact transformation method has been used to get the analytical representation of Floquet Hamiltonian for quadrupolar nuclei with spin $I = 1$ in the presence of an RF field and first order quadrupolar interaction in magic angle spinning NMR experiments. The eigenvalues of contact transformed Hamiltonian as well as Floquet Hamiltonian have been calculated and a comparison is made between the eigenvalues obtained using the two Hamiltonians.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An $ab$ \textit{initio} study on the low-lying potential energy surfaces of H$^+$ $+$ O$_2$ system for different orientations ($\gamma$) of H$^+$ have been undertaken employing the multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) method and Dunning's $cc-p$VTZ basis set to examine their role in influencing the collision dynamics. Nonadiabatic interactions have been analysed for the $2 \times 2$ case in two dimensions for $\gamma = 0^\circ$, 45$^\circ$ and 90$^\circ$, and the corresponding diabatic potential energy surfaces have been obtained using the diabatic wavefunctions and their CI coefficients. The characteristics of the collision dynamics have been analysed in terms of vibrational coupling matrix elements for both inelastic and charge transfer processes in the restricted geometries. The strengths of coupling matrix elements reflect the vibrational excitation patterns observed in the state-to-state beam experiments.</p>

				<title>Quantum control of vibrational excitations in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0433-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optimal control theory is applied to obtain infrared laser pulses for selective vibrational excitation in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule. The problem of finding the optimized field is phrased as a maximization of a cost functional which depends on the laser field. A time dependent Gaussian factor is introduced in the field prior to evaluation of the cost functional for better field shape. Conjugate gradient method$^{21,24}$ is used for optimization of constructed cost functional. At each instant of time, the optimal electric field is calculated and used for the subsequent quantum dynamics, within the dipole approximation. The results are obtained using both Morse potential as well as potential energy obtained using \textit{ab initio} calculations.</p>

				<title>Integrated rate expression for the production of glucose equivalent in C$_4$ green plant and the effect of temperature</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0449-0456</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A temperature-dependent integrated kinetics for the overall process of photosynthesis in green plants is discussed. The C$_4$ plants are chosen and in these plants, the rate of photosynthesis does not depend on the partial pressure of O$_2$. Using some basic concepts like chemical equilibrium or steady state approximation, a simplified scheme is developed for both light and dark reactions. The light reaction rate per reaction center ($R'_1$) in thylakoid membrane is related to the rate of exciton transfer between chlorophyll neighbours and an expression is formulated for the light reaction rate $R'_1$. A relation between $R'_1$ and the NADPH formation rate is established. The relation takes care of the survival probability of the membrane. The CO$_2$ saturation probability in bundle sheath is also taken into consideration. The photochemical efficiency ($\phi$) is expressed in terms of these probabilities. The rate of glucose production is given by $R_{\text{glucose}} = (8/3)(R'_1v_L)\phi(T)g(T)$ ([G3P]/[$P_i$]$^2_{\text{leaf}}$)$_{SS}$Q$_{\text{G3P} \rightarrow \text{glucose}}$ where $g$ is the activity quotient of the involved enzymes, and G3P represent glycealdehyde-3-phosphate in steady state. A Gaussian distribution for temperaturedependence and a sigmoid function for de-activation are incorporated through the quotient $g$. In general, the probabilities are given by sigmoid curves. The corresponding parameters can be easily determined. The theoretically determined temperature-dependence of photochemical efficiency and glucose production rate agree well with the experimental ones, thereby validating the formalism.</p>

					<p>The reaction of ground-state atomic oxygen [O(${}^3P_2$)] with methyl, ethyl, $n$-propyl and isopropyl radicals has been studied using the density functional method and the complete basis set model. The energies of the reactants, products, reaction intermediates and various transition states as well as the reaction enthalpies have been computed. The possible product channels and the reaction pathways are identified in each case. In the case of methyl radical the minimum energy reaction pathway leads to the products CO $+$ H$_2$ $+$ H. In the case of ethyl radical the most facile pathway leads to the products, methanal $+$ CH$_3$ radical. For propyl radical ($n-$ and $iso^-$), the minimum energy reaction pathway would lead to the channel containing ethanal $+$ methyl radical.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Transition states for the insertion reactions of singlet mono and dichlorocarbenes (${}^1$CHCl and ${}^1$CCl$_2$) into C–H bonds of alkanes (methane, ethane, propane and $n$-butane) have been investigated at MP2 and DFT levels with 6-31g ($d, p$) basis set. The $p_\pi$ of ${}^1$CHCl and ${}^1$CCl$_2$ may interact with alkane’s filled fragment orbital of either $\sigma$ or $\pi$ symmetry. So chlorocarbenes insertion reactions have been investigated for both ($\sigma/\pi$) approaches. The $\sigma$ approach has been adjudicated to be the minimum energy path over the $\pi$ approach both at the MP2 and DFT levels. Mulliken, NPA and ESP derived charge analyses have been carried out along the minimal energy reaction path using the IRC method for ${}^1$CHCl and ${}^1$CCl$_2$ insertions into the primary and secondary C–H bonds of propane. The occurrence of TSs either in the electrophilic or nucleophilic phase has been identified through NBO charge analyses in addition to the net charge flow from alkane to the carbene moiety.</p>

The single parameter models with a simple molecular descriptor, the number of atoms in the molecule, provide reasonable results. Better QSTR models with two parameters result when global electrophilicity is used as the second descriptor. In order to tackle both charge- and frontier-controlled reactions the importance of the local electro (nucleo) philicities and atomic charges is also analysed.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we study the reactivity of diimines like 2,2'-bipyridine and its analogues using reactivity descriptors. We discuss evaluation of local descriptors using relaxed as well as frozen approximation and characterize the $\sigma/\pi$ acceptance/donor characteristics of the above ligands. The intermolecular reactivity sequence for the same systems is examined by the global and local philicity index. In addition, electron density analysis has been carried out to highlight the possible strengths of interaction of the bipyridine and its analogues with metal ions.</p>

				<title>Theoretical investigation of redox species in condensed phase</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0501-0508</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We give a detailed description of the use of explicit as well as implicit solvation treatments to compute the reduction potentials of biomolecules in a medium. The explicit solvent method involves quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) treatment of the solvated moiety followed by a Monte–Carlo (MC) simulation of the primary solvent layer. The QM task for considerably large biomolecules is normally carried out by density functional treatment (DFT) along with the MM-assisted evaluation of the most stable configuration for the primary layer and biomolecule complex. The MC simulation accounts for the dynamics of the associated solvent molecules. Contributions of the solvent molecules of the bulk towards the absolute free energy change of the reductive process are incorporated in terms of the Born energy of ion-dielectric interaction, the Onsager energy of dipole–dielectric interaction and the Debye–Hückel energy of ion-ionic cloud interaction. In the implicit solvent treatment, one employs the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Thus the contribution of all the solvent molecules towards the free energy change are incorporated by considering the whole solvent as a dielectric continuum.</p>
					<p>As an example, the QM(DFT)/MM/MC–Born/Onsager/Debye–Hückel corrections yielded the oneelectron reduction potential of Pheophytin-a in the solvent DMF as $−0 \cdot 92 \pm 0 \cdot 27$ V and the two-electron reduction potential as $−1 \cdot 34 \pm 0 \cdot 25$ V at $298 \cdot 15$ K while the DFT–DPCM method yielded the corresponding values as $−1 \cdot 03 \pm 0 \cdot 17$ V and $−1 \cdot 30 \pm 0 \cdot 17$ V, respectively. The calculated values more or less agree with the observed mid-point potentials of $−0 \cdot 90$ V and $−1 \cdot 25$ V, respectively. Moreover, a numerical finite difference Poisson–Boltzmann solution along with the DFT–DPCM methodology was employed to calculate the reduction potential of Pheophytin-a within the thylakoid membrane. The calculated reduction potential value of $−0 \cdot 58$ V is in agreement with the reported value of $−0 \cdot 61$ V that appears in the socalled $Z$-scheme and is considerably different from the value \textit{in vitro}.</p>

				<title>Chiral discrimination in biomimetic systems: Phenylalanine</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0517-0523</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chiral discrimination and recognition is important in peptide biosynthesis, amino acid synthesis and drug designing. Detailed structural information is available about the peptide synthesis in ribosome. However, no detailed study is available about the discrimination in peptide synthesis. We study the conformational energy variation of neutral methoxy phenyl alanine molecule as a function of its different dihedral angle to locate the minimum energy conformation using quantum chemical theory. We compared the intermolecular energy surfaces of phenyl alanine molecule in its neutral and zwitterionic state using quantum chemical theory as a function of distance and mutual orientation. The energy surfaces are studied with rigid geometry by varying the distance and orientation. The potential energy surfaces of $L–L$ and $D–L$ pairs are found to be dissimilar and reflect the underlying chirality of the homochiral pair and racemic nature of the heterochiral pair. The intermolecular energy surface of homochiral pair is more favourable than the corresponding energy surface of heterochiral pair.</p>

				<title>Base pairing in RNA structures: A computational analysis of structural aspects and interaction energies</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0525-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The base pairing patterns in RNA structures are more versatile and completely different as compared to DNA. We present here results of \textit{ab-initio} studies of structures and interaction energies of eight selected RNA base pairs reported in literature. Interaction energies, including BSSE correction, of hydrogen added crystal geometries of base pairs have been calculated at the HF/6-31G$^{\ast\ast}$ level. The structures and interaction energies of the base pairs in the crystal geometry are compared with those obtained after optimization of the base pairs. We find that the base pairs become more planar on full optimization. No change in the hydrogen bonding pattern is seen. It is expected that the inclusion of appropriate considerations of many of these aspects of RNA base pairing would significantly improve the accuracy of RNA secondary structure prediction.</p>

				<title>Reaction mechanism of $O$-acylhydroxamate with cysteine proteases</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0533-0544</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The gas–phase reaction mechanism of $O$-acylhydroxamate with cysteine proteases has been investigated using \textit{ab initio} and density functional theory. On the irreversible process, after breakdown of tetrahedral intermediate (INT1), small 1–2 anionotropic has been formed and rearranged to give stable by-products sulfenamide (P1) and thiocarbamate (P2) with considerable energy loss. While, on the reversible part of this reaction mechanism, intermediate (INT2) breaks down on oxidation, to form a stable product (P3). Topological and AIM analyses have been performed for hydrogen bonded complex in this reaction profile. Intrinsic reaction coordinates [IRC, minimum-energy path (MEP)] calculation connects the transition state between R-INT1, INT1-P1 and INT1-P2. The products P1, P2 and P3 are energetically more stable than the reactant and hence the reaction enthalpy is found to be exothermic.</p>

					<p>The interaction of pres1 region of hepatitis B virus B-cell epitope antigen with specific hepatitis B neutralizing monoclonal antibody was examined by docking study. We modelled the 3D complex structure of B-cell epitope antigen residues CTTPAQGNSMFPSCCCTKPTDGNCY by homology modelling and docked it with the crystal structure of monoclonal antibody specific for the pres1 region of the hepatitis B virus. At the optimized docked conformation, the interactions between the amino acids of antigen and antibody were examined. It is found that the docked complex is stabilized by $59 \cdot 3$ kcal/mol. The stability of the docked antigen–antibody complex is due to hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. The amino acids of the antigen and antibody responsible for the interaction were identified.</p>

				<title>On the analysis of the virulence nature of TIGR4 and R6 strains of \textit{Streptococcus pneumoniae} using genome comparison tools</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0559-0563</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Comparative genome sequence analysis is a powerful technique for gaining insights into any genome of interest. \textit{Streptococcus pneumoniae} is a human pathogen, which causes life-threatening diseases, such as pneumoniae, bacteremia, meningitis, etc. After the whole genome of two strains of \textit{S. pneumoniae}, the virulent TIGR4 and non-pathogenic R6 were sequenced; there is a hope that comparing the genomes will allow an identification of the genes responsible for its virulence and thus the development of treatment and control. Many antimicrobial drugs have diminished the risk from pneumococcal disease because of its multi-drug resistance nature. Several pneumococcal proteins are also being investigated, as virulence factors as potential vaccine or drug targets. Structural and biochemical studies of these pneumococcal virulence factors have facilitated the development of novel antibiotics or protein antigen-based vaccines for the treatment of pneumococcal disease. Here we describe the comparison between the genomes of two strains of \textit{S. pneumoniae} with few existing genomics databases and tools available in the public domain websites. By comparing nucleotide and protein sequences of the two strains, we investigate the existing differences and similarities. Mainly we focus on the virulence factors and its encoding genes in TIGR4 and how do they differ from R6 strain.</p>

					<p>In this study we present ab initio Hartree Fock molecular orbital calculations with complete geometry optimizations on some phenylalkylamines (PAAs) that are clinically used as antiarrhythmic drugs. Pharmacophoric features of PAAs have been derived. An explanation of potency regulation in PAAs has been suggested based on ion capturing vs. ion holding by the drug. Ion capturing by the drug is always electrostatically highly favourable but has to be analysed in terms of conformational changes required and physiological accessibility of the situation. Our results also seem to offer an explanation for inhibitory effect of Ca$^{2+}$ ion concentration on binding affinity of PAAs.</p>

				<title>\textit{In silico} characterization of antifreeze proteins using computational tools and servers</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Theoretical Chemistry Symposium 2006</feature>
				<page>0571-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, seventeen different fish Antifreeze Proteins (AFPs) retrieved from Swiss-Prot database are analysed and characterized using In silico tools. Primary structure analysis shows that most of the AFPs are hydrophobic in nature due to the high content of non-polar residues. The presence of 11 cysteines in the rainbow smelt fish and sea raven fish AFPs infer that these proteins may form disulphide (SS) bonds, which are regarded as a positive factor for stability. The aliphatic index computed by Ex-Pasy’s ProtParam infers that AFPs may be stable for a wide range of temperature. Secondary structure analysis shows that most of the fish AFPs have predominant α-helical structures and rest of the AFPs have mixed secondary structure. The very high coil structural content of rainbow smelt fish and sea raven fish AFPs are due to the rich content of more flexible glycine and hydrophobic proline amino acids. Proline has a special property of creating kinks in polypetide chains and disrupting ordered secondary structure. SOSUI server predicts one transmembrane region in winter flounder fish and atlantic cod and two transmembrane regions in yellowtail flounder fish AFP. The predicted transmembrane regions were visualized and analysed using helical wheel plots generated by EMBOSS pepwheel tool. The presence of disulphide (SS) bonds in the AFPs Q01758 and P05140 are predicted by CYS_REC tool and also identified from the three-dimensional structure using Rasmol tool. The disulphide bonds identified from the three-dimensional structure using the Rasmol tool might be correct as the evaluation parameters are within the acceptable limits for the modelled 3D structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of barium carbonate with 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nbaH) results in the formation of a Ba(II) coordination polymer, \textit{catena}-poly[[(pentaaqua)(4-nitrobenzoato-O,O')barium(II)]($\mu$-4-nitrobenzoato-O,O')] {\bf 1}. The polymeric compound [[Ba(H$_2$O)$_5$(4-nba-O,O')]($\mu$-4-nba-O,O')]$_n$ {\bf 1} was characterized by elemental analysis, IR and UV–Vis spectra, weight loss studies, X-ray powder diffraction and its structure determined. In {\bf 1} five water molecules are coordinated to the central metal and one of the 4-nba ligands is bonded to Ba(II) in a bidentate manner (4-nba-O,O') through the carboxylate O atoms. The [(pentaaqua)(4-nitrobenzoato-O,O')barium(II)] units are linked into an infinite one-dimensional chain along $b$-axis with the aid of the second 4-nba anion, which functions as a bridging bidentate ($\mu$-4-nba-O,O') ligand. This results in nine coordination around each Ba(II) ion in the coordination polymer. A long Ba$\cdots$Ba distance of 6$\cdot$750(1) Å is observed between adjacent Ba(II) ions in the chain and the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group and the nitro functionalities of the 4-nba ligand are involved in several O–H$\cdots$O and C–H$\cdots$O interactions.</p>

				<title>Ternary complexes of cobalt cysteinylglycine with histidylserine and histidylphenylalanine–stabilities and DNA cleavage properties</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0603-0612</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Interaction of cobalt cysteinylglycine with histidylserine and histidylphenylalanine was investigated in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio at 35$^\circ$C and 0⋅10 mol dm$^{–3}$ ionic strength. Their stabilities and geometries were determined. Their DNA binding and cleavage properties were investigated. The intrinsic binding constants ($K_b$) for DNA bound {\bf 1} and {\bf 2} ($3 \cdot 03  \times 10^3$ M$^{–1}$ for {\bf 1} and $3 \cdot 87 \times 10^3$ M$^{–1}$ for {\bf 2}) were determined. Even though the negative charge on the complexes reduced their affinity for DNA, there was an enhancement of binding through specificity. The degradation of plasmid DNA was achieved by cobalt dipeptide complexes [Co$^{II}$(CysGly)(HisSer)] ({\bf 1}) and [Co$^{II}$(CysGly)(HisPhe)] ({\bf 2}). Cleavage experiments revealed that {\bf 1} and {\bf 2} cleave supercoiled DNA (form I) to nicked circular (form II) through hydrolytic pathway at physiological $p$H. The DNA hydrolytic cleavage rate constants for complexes {\bf 1} and {\bf 2} were determined to be $0 \cdot 62$ h$^{–1}$, for {\bf 1} and $0 \cdot 38$ h$^{–1}$ for {\bf 2} respectively.</p>

				<title>Solvent effects in the reaction between piperazine and benzyl bromide</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0613-0616</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction between piperazine and benzyl bromide was studied conductometrically and the second order rate constants were computed. These rate constants determined in 12 different protic and aprotic solvents indicate that the rate of the reaction is influenced by electrophilicity ($E$), hydrogen bond donor ability ($\alpha$) and dipolarity/polarizability ($\pi^\ast$) of the solvent. The LSER derived from the statistical analysis indicates that the transition state is more solvated than the reactants due to hydrogen bond donation and polarizability of the solvent while the reactant is more solvated than the transition state due to electrophilicity of the solvent. Study of the reaction in methanol, dimethyl formamide mixtures suggests that the rate is maximum when dipolar interactions between the two solvents are maximum.</p>

				<title>\textit{Ab initio} study of gas phase and water-assisted tautomerization of maleimide and formamide</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0617-0624</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Maleimide serves as an important starting material in the synthesis of drugs and enzyme inhibitors. In the present paper, knowing the importance of tautomerization in maleimide for its drug action, potential energy surface of maleimide is studied and its tautomerization has been discussed and compared with tautomerization of formamide. Gas phase tautomerization of maleimide requires large amount of energy ($23 \cdot 21$ kcal/mol) in comparison to formamide ($15 \cdot 05$ kcal/mol) at HF/$6-31+$G$^\ast$ level. Thus making the proton transfer reaction a difficult process in gas phase. Water molecule lowers the energy barrier of tautomerization thus facilitating the tautomerization of maleimide to 5-hydroxy-pyrrol-2-one. Water assisted tautomerization of maleimide requires $19 \cdot 60$ kcal/mol energy at HF/$6-31+$G$^\ast$ and $17 \cdot 63$ kcal/mol energy at B3LYP/6-31+G$^\ast$ level, a decrease of $3 \cdot 61$ and $5 \cdot 96$ kcal/mol over gas phase tautomerization. Whereas, tautomerization of formamide requires $14 \cdot 16$ and $12 \cdot 84$ kcal/mol energy, a decrease of $0 \cdot 89$ and $2 \cdot 01$ kcal/mol energy over gas phase tautomerization at HF/6-31+G$^\ast$ and B3LYP/6-31+G$^\ast$ level, respectively. Water-assisted tautomerization in maleimide and formamide showed that difference in energy barrier reduces to $2  \cdot 83$ kcal/mol from $10 \cdot 41$ kcal/mol (in gas phase) at B3LYP level, which resulted that maleimide readily undergoes tautomerization in water molecule.</p>

				<title>Molecular modelling studies on 2-amino 6-aryl-sulphonylbenzonitriles as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors of HIV-1: A QSPR approach</title>

				<page>0625-0630</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lipophilicity or hydrophobicity is a crucial physico-chemical property of an oral drug compound. In the present study, we have analysed the structural parameters responsible for enhancing the lipophilicity expressed in terms of Octanol–Water partition coefficient, log $P$, of 2-amino-6-arylsulfonylbenzonitrile (AASBN) derivatives used as NNRTIs in AIDS therapy. Connectivity based Randic ($\chi$) and Balaban ($J$) and atomistic Kier–Hall electrotopological state ($E$-state) indices have been used to develop Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship (QSPR) and to predict the effect of substitution on the log $P$. Model has been developed using multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) for the training set (67 compounds) and the model was tested on a test set (7 compounds). Significant results were obtained for the training set ($R^2 = 0\cdot 948$, $R^2_{\text{adj}} = 0 \cdot 939$, $SE = 0 \cdot 177$, $F$-ratio = $101 \cdot 22$). The results of the test set too implicated a good fit ($R^2 = 0 \cdot 941$, $R^2_{\text{adj}} = 0\cdot 929$, $SE = 0 \cdot 157$, $F$-ratio = $80 \cdot 05$). Among the two connectivity based topological indices; Randic ($\chi$) index showed better predictive ability than the Balaban ($J$) index. Kier–Hall $E$-state indices indicated that among the functional groups, methyl, bromo, chloro groups on ring A, with their positive coefficients enhanced the lipophilicity. Amino, cyano group on ring B and the bridging S, SO, SO$_2$ with their negative coefficients showed an adverse effect on the lipophilicity parameter. Thus, Kier–Hall $E$-state indices along with topological indices could be well applied for deriving QSPR models and analysing substitution effects of various functional groups. The training set, correlation matrix and observed and experimental log $P$ values are available as supplementary material for this article.</p>

The processing conditions include a rapid pyrolysis step in air and an annealing step in oxygen for Y-123 and in air for Bi-2212. The films obtained have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the formation of a superconducting phase of Y-123 or Bi-2212 was confirmed measuring the critical temperature ($T_c$) with Ac-susceptibility and resistive measurements. Microstructure and final cationic ratios have been studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).</p>

				<title>Graphene-based electrochemical supercapacitors</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0009-0013</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Graphenes prepared by three different methods have been investigated as electrode materials in electrochemical supercapacitors. The samples prepared by exfoliation of graphitic oxide and by the transformation of nanodiamond exhibit high specific capacitance in aq. H$_2$SO$_4$, the value reaching up to 117 F/g. By using an ionic liquid, the operating voltage has been extended to $3⋅5$ V (instead of 1 V in the case of aq. H$_2$SO$_4$), the specific capacitance and energy density being 75 F/g and $31⋅9$ Wh kg$^{–1}$ respectively. This value of the energy density is one of the highest values reported to date. The performance characteristics of the graphenes which are directly related to the quality, in terms of the number of layers and the surface area, are superior to that of single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes.</p>

				<title>Ultrafast fluorescence resonance energy transfer in a bile salt aggregate: Excitation wavelength dependence</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0015-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from Coumarin 153 (C153) to Rhodamine 6G (R6G) in a secondary aggregate of a bile salt (sodium deoxycholate, NaDC) is studied by femtosecond up-conversion. The emission spectrum of C153 in NaDC is analysed in terms of two spectra–one with emission maximum at 480 nm which corresponds to a non-polar and hydrophobic site and another with maximum at $\tilde 530$ nm which arises from a polar hydrophilic site. The time constants of FRET were obtained from the rise time of the emission of the acceptor (R6G). In the NaDC aggregate, FRET occurs in multiple time scales $-4$ ps and 3700 ps. The 4 ps component is assigned to FRET from a donor (D) to an acceptor (A) held at a close distance ($R_{\text{DA}} \tilde 17$ Å) inside the bile salt aggregate. The 3700 ps component corresponds to a donor–acceptor distance $\tilde 48$ Å. The long (3700 ps) component may involve diffusion of the donor. With increase in the excitation wavelength ($\lambda_{\text{ex}}$) from 375 to 435 nm, the relative contribution of the ultrafast component of FRET ($\tilde 4$ ps) increases from 3 to 40&#37; with a concomitant decrease in the contribution of the ultraslow component ($\tilde$3700 ps) from 97 to 60&#37;. The $\lambda_{ex}$ dependence is attributed to the presence of donors at different locations. At a long $\lambda_{\text{ex}}$ (435 nm) donors in the highly polar peripheral region are excited. A short $\lambda_{\text{ex}}$ (375 nm) `selects’ donor at a hydrophobic location.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0025-0031</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The galvanostatic polymerization of pyrrole is carried out on stainless steel electrodes using $p$-toluene sulphonic acid. The morphology of the film is studied from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements while the nature of the substrate is analysed using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDAX) technique. The electrochemical behaviour is studied using cyclic voltammetry, charge–discharge analysis and impedance spectroscopy. The feasibility of the electrode for supercapacitor applications is investigated. The specific capacitance is estimated as $ \tilde 10^2$ Farads per gram with 10$^3$ charge–discharge cycles. A plausible equivalent circuit for the system is proposed and the circuit parameters are obtained by non-linear regression analysis.</p>

				<title>Relaxation dynamics in the excited states of a ketocyanine dye probed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0045-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relaxation dynamics of the excited singlet states of 2,5-$\textit{bis}$-(N-methyl-N-1,3-propdienylaniline)-cyclopentanone (MPAC), a ketocyanine dye, have been investigated using steady-state absorption and emission as well as femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopic techniques. Following photoexcitation using 400 nm light, the molecule is excited to the S$_2$ state, which is fluorescent in rigid matrices at 77 K. S$_2$ state is nearly non-fluorescent in solution and has a very short lifetime ($0⋅5 \pm 0⋅2$ ps). In polar aprotic solvents, the S$_1$ state follows a complex multi-exponential relaxation dynamics consisting of torsional motion of the donor groups, solvent re-organization as well as photoisomerization processes. However, in alcoholic solvents, solvent re-organization via intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction is the only relaxation process observed in the S$_1$ state. In trifluoroethanol, a strong hydrogen bonding solvent, conversion of the non-hydrogen-bonded form, which is formed following photoexcitation, to the hydrogen-bonded complex has been clearly evident in the relaxation process of the S$_1$ state.</p>

				<title>General approaches in ensemble quantum computing</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0057-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have developed methodology for NMR quantum computing focusing on enhancing the efficiency of initialization, of logic gate implementation and of readout. Our general strategy involves the application of rotating frame pulse sequences to prepare pseudopure states and to perform logic operations. We demonstrate experimentally our methodology for both homonuclear and heteronuclear spin ensembles. On model two-spin systems, the initialization time of one of our sequences is three-fourths (in the heteronuclear case) or one-fourth (in the homonuclear case), of the typical pulsed free precession sequences, attaining the same initialization efficiency. We have implemented the logical SWAP operation in homonuclear AMX spin systems using selective isotropic mixing, reducing the duration taken to a third compared to the standard re-focused INEPT-type sequence. We introduce the 1D version for readout of the rotating frame SWAP operation, in an attempt to reduce readout time. We further demonstrate the Hadamard mode of 1D SWAP, which offers 2$^{\text{N}}$-fold reduction in experiment time for a system with $N$-working bits, attaining the same sensitivity as the standard 1D version.</p>

				<title>Effects of ion concentration on the hydrogen bonded structure of water in the vicinity of ions in aqueous NaCl solutions</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0071-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics simulations of dilute and concentrated aqueous NaCl solutions are carried out to investigate the changes of the hydrogen bonded structures in the vicinity of ions for different ion concentrations. An analysis of the hydrogen bond population in the first and second solvation shells of the ions and in the bulk water is done. Although essentially no effect of ions on the hydrogen bonding is observed beyond the first solvation shell of the ions for the dilute solutions, for the concentrated solutions a noticeable change in the average number of water–water hydrogen bonds is observed in the second solvation shells of the ions and even beyond. However, the changes in the average number of hydrogen bonds are found to be relatively less when both water–water and ion–water hydrogen bonds are counted. Thus, the changes in the total number of hydrogen bonds per water are not very dramatic beyond the first solvation shell even for concentrated solutions.</p>

				<title>Growth of anisotropic gold nanostructures on conducting glass surfaces</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0079-0085</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we describe a method for the growth of gold nanowires and nanoplates starting from a bilayer array of gold seeds, anchored on electrically conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. This is based on a seed-mediated growth approach, where the nanoparticles attached on the substrate through molecular linkages are converted to nanowires and nanoplates at certain cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) concentration. Our modified approach can be used to make nanowires of several tens of micrometers length at a lower CTAB concentration of $0⋅1$ M. The length of the nanowires can be varied by adjusting the time of the reaction. As the concentration of CTAB was increased to $0⋅25$ M, the nanoparticles got converted to nanoplates. These Au nanoplates are (111) oriented and are aligned parallel to the substrate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of [RhCl$_2$(HPhL)(PhL)] with M$^{\text{II}}$(ClO$_4$)$_2⋅6$H$_2$O in presence of alkali has furnished trinuclear [RhCl$_2$(PhL)$_2$]$_2$M(H$_2$O)$_2⋅$H$_2$O (HPhL is phenylazobenzaldoxime; M = Mn, Co, Ni). A similar reaction with M$^{\text{I}}$(PPh$_3$)$_2$NO$_3$ yielded binuclear [RhCl$_2$(PhL)$_2$]M(PPh$_3$)$_2$ (M = Cu, Ag). In these molecules the oximato group acts as a bridge between Rh$^{\text{III}}$ (bonded at N) and M$^{\text{II}}$ or M$^{\text{I}}$ (bonded at O). In structurally characterized [Rh$^{\text{III}}$Cl$_2$(PhL)$_2$]$_2$Mn(H$_2$O)$_2$.H$_2$O the centrosymmetric distorted octahedral MnO6 coordination sphere is spanned by four oximato oxygen atoms and two water molecules lying in trans position. In the lattice the neighbouring molecules are held together by H$_2$O$\cdotsH$_2$O$\cdots$H$_2$O hydrogen bonds generating infinite zigzag chains. The manganese atoms lie parallel to the C-axis, the shortest Mn…Mn distance being $7⋅992$ Å. Magnetic exchange interactions if any are small as seen in room temperature magnetic moments. The manganese system displays a strong EPR signal near $g = 2⋅00$. In the complex [RhCl$_2$(PhL)$_2$]Cu(PPh$_3$)$_2$ the copper atom is coordinated to two oximato oxygen atoms and the two phosphorus atoms in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The softness of the phosphine ligand is believed to sustain the stable coordination of hard oximato oxygen to soft Cu$^{\text{I}}$. The coordination sphere of the Rh$^{\text{III}}$ atom in both the complexes is uniformly $\textit{trans}$-RhN$_4$Cl$_2$.</p>

In the crystal structure, both lattice water molecules are found to interact with the heptamolybdate cluster anion and the protonated hexamethylenetetramine cation resulting in an intricate three-dimensional hydrogen bonding network. Interestingly, compound {\bf 1} exhibits catalytic activity towards oxidation of some primary alcohols.</p>

				<title>Cyclic porphyrin dimers as hosts for coordinating ligands</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0115-0129</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bicovalently linked tetraphenylporphyrins bearing dioxypentane groups at the opposite (transoid, H$_4$A) and adjacent (cisoid, H$_4$B) aryl groups have been synthesised. Protonation of the free-base porphyrins leads to fully protonated species H$_8$A$^{4+}$/H$_8$A$^{4+}$ accompanied by expansion of cavity size of the bisporphyrins. The electrochemical redox studies of these porphyrins and their Zinc(II) derivatives revealed that the first ring oxidation proceeds through a two-electron process while the second ring oxidation occurs at two distinct one-electron steps indicating unsymmetrical charge distribution in the oxidized intermediate. The axial ligation properties of the Zinc(Il) derivatives of H$_4$A/H$_4$B with DABCO and PMDA investigated by spectroscopic and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies showed predominant existence of 1 : I complex. The Zn$_2$A.DABCO complex assumes an interesting eclipsed structure wherein DABCO is located inside the cavity between the two porphyrin planes with Zn–N distances at $2⋅08$ and $2⋅22$ Å. The Zn atoms are pulled into the cavity due to coordination towards nitrogen atoms of DABCO and deviate from the mean porphyrin plane by $0⋅35$ Å. The electrochemical redox potentials of the axially ligated metal derivatives are found to be sensitive function of the relative coordinating ability of the ligands and the conformation of the hosts.</p>

					<p>The reaction of phosphorus trichloride with 2,6-di$\textit{iso}$propyl phenol in the presence of LiCl under reflux conditions for 24 h produces a mixture of (ArO)PCl$_2$ and (ArO)$_2$PCl (Ar = 2,6-$i$Pr$_2$C$_6$H$_3$).

The title compounds have presumably formed via acetone insertion to the P–H bonds of (ArO)P(O)(H)(OH) and (ArO)$_2$P(O)(H), respectively, in the presence of HCl produced during the hydrolysis. Compounds {\bf 1} and {\bf 2} have been characterized by elemental analysis, and ESI-mass, Infrared and NMR spectroscopic techniques.

				<title>Effect of thione–thiol tautomerism on the inhibition of lactoperoxidase by anti-thyroid drugs and their analogues</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0143-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The keto-enol type tautomerism in anti-thyroid drugs and their selenium analogues are described. The commonly used anti-thyroid drug methimazole exists predominantly in its thione form, whereas its selenium analogue exists in a zwitterionic form. To understand the effect of thione/thiol and selone/selenol tautomerism on the inhibition of peroxidase-catalysed reactions, we have synthesized some thiones and selones in which the formation of thiol/selenol forms are blocked by different substituents. These compounds were synthesized by a carbene route utilizing an imidazolium salt. The crystal structures of these compounds reveal that the C=Se bonds in the selones are more polarized than the C=S bonds in the corresponding thiones. The structures of selones were studied in solution by NMR spectroscopy and the ${}^{77}$Se NMR chemical shifts for the selones show large upfield shifts in the signals, confirming their zwitterionic structures in solution. The inhibition of lactoperoxidase by the synthetic thiones indicates that the presence of a free N-H moiety is essential for an efficient inhibition. In contrast, such moiety is not required for an inhibition by the selenium compounds.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This study describes peptide fibre formation in a hexapeptide, derived from the V3 loop of HIV-1, mediated by the interactions between arginine residues and phosphate/carboxylate anions. This charge neutralization approach was further confirmed when the deletion of arginine residue from the hexapeptide sequence resulted in fibre formation, which was studied by a combination of microscopic techniques.</p>

				<title>Propargyloxycarbonyl as a protecting group for the side chains of serine, threonine and tyrosine</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0163-0173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Propargyloxycarbonyl group is used as a protecting group for the hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine and tyrosine. The propargyloxycarbonyl derivatives of these hydroxy amino acids are stable to acidic and basic reagents commonly employed in peptide synthesis. The deprotection of the $O$-Poc derivatives using tetrathiomolybdate does not affect commonly used protecting groups such as $N$-Boc, $N$-Cbz, $N$-Fmoc, methyl and benzyl esters. The di- and tripeptides synthesized using $O$-Poc derivatives of serine, threonine and tyrosine are stable, isolable compounds and give the hydroxy peptides in good yields when treated with tetrathiomolybdate.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0181-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comparative study of the pore properties of SBA-15 samples prepared under nonhydrothermal and hydrothermal conditions, in the absence and presence of carboxylic acids such as succinic, tartaric and citric acids has been carried out. In the absence of carboxylic acid, flake-like and spheroid particles were generally obtained irrespective of the preparative procedures. On the other hand, stirring of the pre-mix induces a rod-like morphology in presence of carboxylic acids. The samples prepared under non-hydrothermal conditions exhibit a higher degree of silicate condensation compared to those synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. SBA-15 samples prepared under hydrothermal conditions show higher values of the d (100) spacing independent of the presence of carboxylic acids. Presence of carboxylic acids as well as hydrothermal treatment improves the pore properties of SBA-15.</p>

				<title>Understanding the folding process of synthetic polymers by small-molecule folding agents</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0187-0194</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two acceptor containing polyimides PDI and NDI carrying pyromellitic diimide units and 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxy diimide units, respectively, along with hexa(oxyethylene) (EO6) segments as linkers, were prepared from the corresponding dianhydrides and diamines. These polyimides were made to fold by interaction with specifically designed folding agents containing a dialkoxynaphthalene (DAN) donor linked to a carboxylic acid group. The alkali-metal counter-ion of the donor carboxylic acid upon complexation with the EO6 segment brings the DAN unit in the right location to induce a charge–transfer complex formation with acceptor units in the polymer backbone. This two-point interaction between the folding agent and the polymer backbone leads to a folding of the polymer chain, which was readily monitored by NMR titrations. The effect of various parameters, such as structures of the folding agent and polymer, and the solvent composition, on the folding propensities of the polymer was studied.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Research Society of India – Tenth Anniversary</feature>
				<page>0195-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A kinetic study of the tumor-associated galactopyranosyl-(1$\rightarrow$3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-$\alpha$-Dgalactopyranoside (T-antigen) with lectin peanut agglutinin is described. The disaccharide antigen was synthesized by chemical methods and was functionalized suitably for immobilization onto a carboxymethylated sensor chip. The ligand immobilized surface was allowed interaction with the lectin peanut agglutinin, which acted as the analyte and the interaction was studied by the surface plasmon resonance method. The ligand–lectin interaction was characterized by the kinetic on-off rates and a bivalent analyte binding model was found to describe the observed kinetic constants. It was identified that the antigen–lectin interaction had a faster association rate constant ($k_{a1}$) and a slower dissociation rate constant ($k_{d1}$) in the initial binding step. The subsequent binding step showed much reduced kinetic rates. The antigen–lectin interaction was compared with the kinetic rates of the interaction of a galactopyranosyl-($1\rightarrow 4$)-$\beta$-D-galactopyranoside derivative and a mannopyranoside derivative with the lectin.</p>

				<title>Regio and stereoselectivity in ionic cycloadditions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0225-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Acridizinium cation (ACR) and 2,3-dimethylisoquinolinium ion (DMIQ) undergo [$2 + 4^+$] addition with dienophiles methyl vinyl ether (MVE) and propylene (PY) and the addition takes place across the diene unit containing the cationic centre and the dienophile acts as the electron donor. These reactions have two regiochemical paths and in each of them two possible stereo adducts could be formed. DFT calculations performed at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level have shown that the reactions pass through concerted mechanism and the TSs are highly asynchronous. Methoxy group in the dienophile can take up $\textit{cis}$ or trans orientation with respect to the double bond and in that $\textit{trans}$ orientation of the methoxy group is preferred. Calculations further show that $\textit{syn}$ 2 adduct is kinetically and thermodynamically more favoured in both the reactions in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. ACR is found to be more reactive than DMIQ as a diene and as a dienophile MVE is found to be more reactive than PY. Computed bond orders establish that the $\textit{syn}$ 2 transition states are the most `reactant’ like. Though the reactions have both electrostatic control and frontier orbital control the former dominates in the initial stages of the reaction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Role of alkali and alkaline earth ions on the formation of calix[4]arene-amide derivatives through $O$-alkylation of the lower rim phenolic-OH groups in general and template action of K$^+$ in particular have been explored. Na$^+$ and K$^+$ ions among alkali, and Ca$^{2+}$ and Sr$^{2+}$ ions among alkaline earth have shown tetra-amide derivatives bound to metal ion species. Among all these, potassium salts act as template and yields a K$^+$ bound tetra-amide derivative where the charge is counter balanced by a calix[4] arene-monoanion and the product is crystallographically characterized. Change in the amide precursor used in these $O$-alkylation reactions has no effect on the type of the amide derivative formed. Also demonstrated is a direct one-step reaction for the preparation of 1,3-di-amide derivative in high yield and low reaction period using CsHCO$_3$.</p>

				<title>A one-dimensional barium(II) coordination polymer with a coordinated nitro group of 2-nitrobenzoate</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0249-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aqueous reaction of barium carbonate with 2-nitrobenzoic acid (2-nbaH) results in the formation of a one-dimensional coordination polymer, $\textit{catena}$-poly[[hexa(aqua)dibarium(II)]$\textit{bis}$[($\mu_2$-2-nitrobenzoate-O,O,O-NO$_2$)($\mu_2$-2-nitrobenzoate-O,O,O')]] {\bf 1}. On heating at 100$^\circ$C compound ${\bf 1}$ is dehydrated to anhydrous barium $\textit{bis}$(2-nitrobenzoate) ${\bf 2}$. The anhydrous compound can be re-hydrated to ${\bf 1}$ on exposure to water vapour. Compounds ${\bf 1}$ and ${\bf 2}$ were characterized by elemental analysis, IR and UV-Vis spectra, DSC thermograms, weight loss studies and the structure of ${\bf 1}$ was determined. ${\bf 1}$ and ${\bf 2}$ can be thermally decomposed to BaCO$_3$ by heating at 800$^\circ$C. The polymer [[Ba(H$_2$O)$_3$]$_2$($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O-NO$_2$)$_2$ ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O')$_2$]$_n$ ${\bf 1}$ crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P$_{\bar{i}}$ and all atoms are located in general positions. The polymeric structure is based on a dimeric unit and consists of three water molecules coordinated to a central Ba(II) and two unique 2-nitrobenzoate (2-nba) anions, one of which ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O-NO$_2$) functions as a tridentate ligand and is linked to a Ba(II) through the oxygen atom of the –NO$_2$ group and forms a monoatomic $\mu_2$-carboxylate bridge between two symmetry related Ba(II) ions with a Ba$\cdots$Ba distance of $4⋅5726$(14) Å. The second unique 2-nba anion ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O') also functions as a tridentate ligand with the carboxylate oxygen atoms linked to a Ba(II) ion in a bidentate fashion and one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms forming a monoatomic bridge between two symmetry related Ba(II) ions resulting in a Ba$\cdots$Ba separation of $4⋅5406$(15) Å. These differing tridentate 2-nba ligands link $\{$Ba(H$_2$O)$_3\}$ units into a one-dimensional polymeric chain extending along $b$ axis. In the infinite chain each nine coordinated Ba(II) is bonded to three water molecules and further linked to six oxygen atoms of four different 2-nitrobenzoate anions with alternating pairs of Ba(II) ions in the chain bridged by a pair of ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O-NO$_2$) and ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O') ligands resulting in alternating Ba$\cdots$Ba distances of $4⋅5406$(15) and $4⋅5726$(14) Å across the chain.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The synthesis and characterization of new $\textit{meso}$-substituted unsymmetrical metalloporphyrins has been described. A new modified Adler method was used for the synthesis of two unsymmetrical porphyrins. Reactions of these unsymmetrical porphyrins with metal acetates afforded the corresponding metalloporphyrins in high yields with excellent purity. These porphyrins and their metal derivatives were characterized by spectroscopic methods. However, the copper complexes were further studied by ESR spectra and zinc complex by fluorescence spectrum.</p>

				<title>Analysis of urinary stone constituents using powder X-ray diffraction and FT–IR</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0267-0273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Constituents of urinary stones obtained from various patients from western part of India, which is a highly urinary stone disease-prone area, have been analysed. Eight stones from four patients were collected through urologists and have been analysed using powder X-ray diffraction and FT–IR. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of selected samples were also carried out. The analysis revealed that calcium oxalate monohydrate, which is also known as whewellite, is the common constituent of all of the stones, particularly at the initial stage of stone formation. However, multi phases viz. whewellite phase, and hydroxyl and carbonate apatite phases are also detected in the case of third and fourth patients, from where multiple stones were obtained. Interestingly, in these mixed phase stones the concentration of whewellite decreases with increasing the concentration of apatite phases. Thermal behaviour of the whewellite phase was studied by TGA and variable temperature XRD analysis. Morphology of the whewellite and apatite phases, examined by SEM image, has also been reported.</p>

				<title>Structural transition in alcohol–water binary mixtures: A spectroscopic study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0275-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The strengthening of the hydrogen bonding (H-bond) network as well as transition from the tetrahedral-like water network to the zigzag chain structure of alcohol upon increasing the alcohol concentration in ethanol–water and tertiary butanol (TBA) – water mixtures have been studied by using both steady state and time resolved spectroscopy. Absorption and emission characteristics of coumarin 153 (C153), a widely used non-reactive solvation probe, have been monitored to investigate the structural transition in these binary mixtures. The effects of the hydrogen bond (H-bond) network with alcohol concentration are revealed by a minimum in the peak frequency of the absorption spectrum of C153 which occur at alcohol mole fraction $\tilde 0 ⋅10$ for water–ethanol and at $\tilde 0⋅04$ for water–TBA mixtures. These are the mole fractions around which several thermodynamic properties of these mixtures show anomalous change due to the enhancement of H-bonding network. While the strengthening of H-bond network is revealed by the absorption spectra, the emission characteristics show the typical non-ideal alcohol mole fraction dependence at all concentrations. The time resolved anisotropy decay of C153 has been found to be bi-exponential at all alcohol mole fractions. The sharp change in slopes of average rotational correlation time with alcohol mole fraction indicates the structural transition in the environment around the rotating solute. The changes in slopes occur at mole fraction $\tilde 0⋅10$ for TBA–water and at $\tilde 0⋅2$ for ethanol–water mixtures, which are believed to reflect alcohol mole fraction induced structural changes in these alcohol–water binary mixtures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal decomposition of LiPF$_6$ and LiBC$_4$O$_8$ (lithium bis(oxalate)borate, abbreviated as LiBOB) were studied using TG (thermogravimetry)-DTG (derivative thermogravimetry) method with different heating rate $\beta$ of 5, 10, 20 and 40$^\circ$C min$^{–1}$ or at different constant temperature $\theta_C$ ($109⋅80$, $118⋅79$, $148⋅41$, $176⋅86^\circ$C for LiPF$_6$ and $278⋅51$, $298⋅13$, $317⋅65$, $336⋅13$ for LiBOB). From the nonisothermal kinetics we calculate that $n_{\text{LiPF6}}$ is $1⋅01$, $n_{\text{LiBOB}}$ is $1⋅04$, $E_{\text{LiPF6}}$ is $91907⋅61$ J/mol, and $E_{\text{LiBOB}}$ is $205179⋅88$ J/mol; from the isothermal kinetics we calculate that n for both LiPF6 and LiBOB are 1, $E_{\text{LiPF6}}$ is $91907⋅61$ J/mol, $E_{\text{LiBOB}}$ is $205179⋅88$ J/mol, lnA$_{\text{LiPF6}}$ is $16⋅89$ s$^{–1}$, and lnA$_{\text{LiBOB}}$ is $31⋅96$ s$^{–1}$. The results obtained from the two ways have minor differences and can validate each other.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0297-0304</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An inorganic–organic hybrid material, [2-AmpH]$_4$[Mo$_8$O$_{26}$] (${\bf 1}$) has been isolated by the reaction of Na$_2$MoO$_4·2$H$_2$O with 2-aminopyrimidine (2-Amp) from an acidic aqueous medium. In this low pH synthesis, the organic molecule (2-Amp) gets mono-protonated (2-AmpH$^+$) and acts as the cation in stabilizing the octamolybdate anion in ${\bf 1}$. Compound ${\bf 1}$ crystallizes in the triclinic space group $P–1$ with $a = 9⋅925$(3), $b = 10⋅020$(3), $c = 10⋅414$(3) Å, $\alpha = 88⋅811$(4), $\beta = 64⋅907$(4), $\gamma = 89⋅506$(4)$^\circ$, $Z = 1$. An interesting three-dimensional supramolecular structure, having well-defined channels, is formed through N–H$\cdots$O and C–H$\cdots$O hydrogen bonds, in which the protonated organic cation plays a significant role. The crystal structure also reveals an unusual cluster–cluster (non-covalent O$\cdots$O) interaction using $\text{cis}$-(MoO$_2\}$ moieties of the isopolyanion. N–H$\cdots$O hydrogen bonds, originated from pyridimidinium cation and isopolyanion, are found to influence to attain such non-covalent O$\cdots$O interactions among polyoxometalate anions. An interesting helical arrangement, formed from isopolyanion and organic cation, is observed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The FTIR and FT Raman spectra of dacarbazine were recorded in the regions 4000–400 and 3500–100 cm$^{–1}$, respectively. The optimized geometry, wavenumber, polarizability and several thermodynamic properties of dacarbazine were studied using $\textit{ab initio}$ Hartree–Fock, MP2 and DFT methods. A complete vibrational assignment aided by the theoretical harmonic wavenumber analysis was proposed. The calculated harmonic vibrational frequencies were compared with experimental FTIR and FT Raman spectra. Based on the comparison between calculated and experimental results and the comparison with related molecules, assignments of fundamental vibrational modes were made. The X-ray geometry and experimental frequencies were compared with the results of theoretical calculations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of cleavage of phenylphenyl acetates (PPA) and several $\textit{para}$-substituted PPAs in basic aqueous sodium carbonate–bicarbonate buffer containing $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) have been studied. The reaction exhibits saturation type kinetics and CD accelerates the rate of cleavage by the formation of 1G : 1H inclusion complex. The kinetic results indicate that aryloxy moiety of PPA is included in the hydrophobic cavity of CD. The overall rate constants for the cleavage of the [CD–ester] complex correlate with the Hammett $\sigma$-constants and Hansch hydrophobicity parameters $\pi$. At higher concentrations of CD, there is an additional catalysis due to the formation of weak 1G : 2H complex.</p>

				<title>The ribose and glycine Maillard reaction in the interstellar medium (ISM): A theoretical study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0329-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Possibility of the Maillard reaction to take place in the gaseous phase in the interstellar medium was investigated by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations. Cyclic ribose ($\textbf{c-Rib}$)/open-chain ribose ($\textbf{c-Rib}$) and glycine were taken as the model. Mechanisms have been proposed, and possibility of the formation of different compounds have been evaluated through calculating the Gibb’s free energy changes for different steps of the reaction by following the total mass balance. The result reveals that both $\textbf{c-Rib}$ and $\textbf{Rib}$ can participate in the reaction, and $\textbf{c-Rib}$ is more efficient than $\textbf{Rib}$. The reactions under basic and neutral conditions are supposed to be the first and second most favourable. Acidic conditions and the isoelectric point of glycine were unfeasible for the reaction. The kinetics of the mechanics are briefly addressed in this work.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, photoluminescence and electrochemical properties of 2,7-diarylfluorene derivatives</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0355-0362</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new class of highly fluorescent 9,9'-$\textit{bis}$-(alkyl)-2,7-diarylfluorene having electron withdrawing or electron donating groups on the $p$-phenyl positions were synthesized and characterized. The highly luminescent fluorene derivatives, ${\textbf{1–6}}$ showed blue emission (376–416 nm), narrow FWHM ($\tilde$ 50 nm), high quantum yield ($\phi_{\text{F}} = 0⋅12–0⋅87$) and short fluorescence lifetimes, $\tau_{\text{F}} = 0⋅23–1⋅14$ ns. The HOMO levels of 9,9'-$\textit{bis}$-(alkyl)-fluorene were tuned by the p-substituents at 2,7-phenyl group. Hammett correlation with $E_{\text{HOMO}}$ of these new molecules provides an effective tool to predict the HOMO level of similar molecules prior to the synthesis. These data indicate that they are useful as emitting materials for organic light emitting devices, OLEDs.</p>

					<p>The reactions of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazatriene, N$_3$P$_3$Cl$_6$, with N$_2$O$_2$-donor type coronands, Ph$_2$[OR$_1$O][CH$_2$NHR$_2$NHCH$_2$] [R$_1$ = (CH$_2$)$_3$, R$_2$ = (CH$_2$)$_3$ (${\bf 1}$), R$_1$ = (CH$_2$)$_3$, R$_2$ = (CH$_2$)$_4$ (${\bf 2}$), R$_1$ = (CH$_2$)$_4$, R$_2$ = (CH$_2$)$_4$ (${\bf 3}$)], give monotopic $\textit{spiro}$-crypta phosphazene architectures, N$_3$P$_3$Cl$_4\{$Ph$_2$ [OR$_1$O][CH$_2$NR$_2$NCH$_2$]$\}$ [R$_1$ = (CH$_2$)$_3$, R$_2$ = (CH$_2$)$_3$ (${\bf 4}$), R$_1$ = (CH$_2$)$_3$, R$_2$ = (CH$_2$)$_4$ (${\bf 5}$) and R$_1$ = (CH$_2$)$_4$, R$_2$ = (CH$_2$)$_4$ ({\bf 6})], respectively. The reaction of ${\bf 4}$ with excess pyrrolidine leads to the formation of geminal N$_3$P$_3$Cl$_2$(C$_5$H$_5$N)$_2\{$Ph$_2$[O(CH$_2$)$_3$O] [CH$_2$N(CH$_2$)$_3$NCH$_2$]$\}$ (${\bf 7}$). The ${}^{31}$P-NMR spectra of ${\bf 5}$ and ${\bf 6}$ indicate that these compounds have anisochronism. The structures of ${\bf 5}$, ${\bf 6}$ and ${\bf 7}$ were investigated by X-ray crystallography. For ${\bf 7}$, the sums of the bond angles around the N atoms were $348⋅6$(2)$^\circ$ and $349⋅7$(2)$^\circ$ indicating that the N atoms have pyramidal configurations and are stereogenic. The relationship between the chemical shift values $\deltaP_{\text{(spiro)}}$ and the $\Delta(P–N)$ (electron density transfer parameters) of ${\bf 4, 5, 6, 7}$ and the analogous compounds as well as the relationship between the $\Delta(\deltaP)$ values and the above mentioned $\Delta(P–N)$ are presented respectively. In addition, the relationship between the endocyclic NPN bond angles of these compounds and the ${}^{31}$P-NMR chemical shifts of the spiro-phosphorus atoms were investigated. The spectroscopic and structural investigations of the compounds were made by elemental analyses, MS, FTIR, one-dimensional ${}^1$H-, ${}^{13}$C-, ${}^{31}$P-NMR, DEPT and two-dimensional COSY, HETCOR, HMBC, homo- and heteronuclear correlation techniques.</p>

					<p>Combined pH-metric and spectrophotometric investigations on the complex formation equilibria of Cu$^{\text{II}}$ with guanylurea (H$_2^1$NC(=O) ${}^2$NH.C(=$^3$NH) ${}^4$NH$_2$), hereafter, GuH, in the absence and in the presence of glycine (GlyH), in aqueous solution indicates variety of binary and mixed-ligand complexes: Cu(Gu)$^+$, Cu(Gu)(OH); Cu(Gu)$_2$, Cu(Gu-H)(Gu)$^–$, Cu(Gu-H)$_2^{2–}$, Cu(Gu-H)(Gu-2H)$^{3–}$; Cu(Gly)$^+$, Cu(Gly) (OH); Cu(Gly)(Gu); Cu(Gly)(Gu-H)$^–$, Cu(Gly)(Gu-2H)$^{2–}$; (Gly)Cu(Gu)Cu(Gly)$^+$, (Gly)Cu(Gu-H)Cu(Gly) and (Gly)Cu(Gu-2H)Cu(Gly)$^–$. At pH &lt; 6, guanylurea anion (Gu$^–$) acts as a [(C=O), ${}^3$N$^–$] or [=${}^1$NH, ${}^3$N$^–$] bidentate ligand and above pH 7 it is transformed through a coordination equilibrium into a (=${}^1$N$^–$, =${}^3$N$^–$) bidentate ligand, similar to biguanide dianion. Occurrence of dinuclear complex species, (Gly) Cu(Gu)Cu(Gly)$^+$, in the complexation equilibria, indicates bridging double bidentate [(${}^1$NH$_2$, ${}^3$N$^–$), (C=O, ${}^4$NH$_2$)] and/or [(${}^1$NH$_2$, ${}^4$NH$_2$), (C=O, ${}^3$N$^–$)] chelation by Gu$^–$ ion in an isomeric equilibrium. Above pH $6⋅5$, the dinuclear complex decomposes mostly to the mononuclear species, Cu(Gly)(OH) and Cu(Gu)(OH) and only partly deprotonates to (Gly)Cu(Gu-H)Cu(Gly) and (Gly)Cu(Gu-2H)Cu(Gly)$^–$. Electronic spectral shifts, with change of pH have been correlated with the possible modes of coordination of guanylurea species.</p>

				<title>Assessing ligand efficiencies using template-based molecular docking and Tabu-clustering on tetrahydroimidazo-[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives as HIV-1RT inhibitors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0395-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A template-based flexible docking simulation followed by `Tabu-clustering’ was performed on a series of 38 TIBO derivatives as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) inhibitors. Four different templates of the Cl-TIBO (1-REV) were created and used as reference templates for docking and aligning. On the basis of the optimal conformation of the ligands, when fitting to the template, the respective scoring functions were obtained; different ligand efficiencies were evaluated and analysed. Statistical modelling using artificial neural network (ANN: $r^2 = 0⋅922$) and multiple linear regression method (MLR: $r^2 = 0⋅851$) showed good correlation between the biological activity, binding affinity, and different ligand efficiencies of the compounds, which suggest the robustness of the template-based binding conformations of these inhibitors. Our studies suggest that, template-based docking followed by ‘Tabuclustering’ will give a better alignment of inhibitors with respect to the crystal coordinates and enhance the docking efficiency. Also, our study indicates that scoring functions based on 3D symmetry analysis along with heavy atoms count serve as a valuable tool for estimating the efficiency of the ligands. Thus, this is a novel method based on heavy atoms count predicting the binding affinity of the TIBO group of inhibitors, so that their therapeutic utility can be enhanced.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The surface geometry of methyl 3-(4-methoxy phenyl)prop-2-enoate molecule was studied by analysis of the SERS spectra adsorbed on silver colloid surfaces. For a reliable analysis of the SERS spectrum, we also performed density functional theoretical calculations. The absence of a C–H stretching vibrations and the observed C–H out-of-plane bending modes suggest that the MMP molecule may be adsorbed in a flat on orientation to the surface. The SERS spectral studies predict a tilted orientation of ethylenic bridge with respect to the phenyl ring.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Catalytic efficiency of two Schiff base manganese(III) complexes toward the hydrolysis of $\textit{bis}$($p$-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) was evaluated in a micellar media formed by $\textit{bis}$(hexadecyldimethylammonium) hexane bromide (abbr.16–6–16, 2Br$^–$) at $25^\circ$C. Effects of various reaction conditions on the hydrolysis of BNPP were systematically investigated. The observations obtained indicate that the two Mn(III) catalysts can efficiently promote hydrolysis of BNPP with a six order of magnitude rate enhancement relative to the background rate constant ($k_0$). Different structures of the two complexes lend to their distinguishing activities each other. Furthermore, rates of BNPP hydrolysis in Gemini 16–6–16 micellar medium are much higher than that in hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and $n$-lauroylsarcosine sodium (LSS) micelles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple and highly sensitive electrochemical method for the determination of human serum albumin (HSA) using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), based on a silver electrode modified with a self-assembled monolayer of L-cysteine, was developed. L-cysteine can be modified onto a silver electrode by covalent bonding through the sulfur to give stable and long-lived chemical electrodes. This electrode showed good sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility and time stability in the determination of trace amounts of HSA by DPV technique. The detection limit can be as low as $4 \times 10^{–17}$ mol/L. The optimum conditions for the determination were carefully investigated. This method had been applied to the determination of HSA in human serum samples. The results were in agreement with those given in standard method.</p>

				<title>Palladium and platinum complexes of 2-(2'-carboxyphenylazo)-4 methylphenol: Synthesis, structure and spectral properties</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0441-0446</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reaction of 2-(2'-carboxyphenylazo)-4-methylphenol (H$_2$L) with [M(PPh$_3$)$_2$Cl$_2$] (M = Pd, Pt) affords mixed-ligand complexes of type [M(PPh3)(L)]. Structures of both the complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. Both the complexes are square planar, where the 2-(2'-carboxyphenylazo)-4-methylphenol is coordinated to the metal center, via dissociation of the two acidic protons, as a dianionic tridentate O,N,O-donor, and the fourth position is occupied by the triphenylphosphine. These complexes show intense MLCT transitions in the visible region.</p>

					<p>Reaction of $N$-(phenyl)-2-pyridinecarboxamide (HL$^1$) and $N$-($p$-tolyl)-2-pyridinecarboxamide (HL$^2$) ligands with MnCl$_2$⋅4H$_2$O affords complexes [(HL$^1$)$_2$MnCl$_2$] ${\bf 1}$ and [(HL$^2$)$_2$MnCl$_2$] ${\bf 2}$. The structures of ${\bf 1}$ and ${\bf 2}$ were determined by three-dimensional X-ray crystallography revealing that the Mn$^{\text{II}}$ ions assume distorted octahedral geometry with coordination by two HL$^1$/HL$^2$ ligands providing two pyridine N and two amide O and two chloride ions. Notably, secondary interactions [C–H$\cdots$Cl (pyridine 3-H hydrogen) and N–H$\cdots$Cl (amide NH hydrogen)] triggered by Mn$^{\text{II}}$-coordinated chloride ions acting as hydrogen bonding acceptors generate self-complementary dimeric tectons, which lead to 2D supramolecular architectures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new photosensitizer having two rhodanine acetic acid groups at $\textit{meso}$-positions of a zinc porphyrin [$\textit{meso}$-Rhod-Zn-Rhod] has been synthesized and characterized by UV-Visible, ${}^1$H NMR, MALDI-MS, fluorescence spectroscopies and cyclic voltammetry. The new photosensitizer was tested in dye-sensitized solar cells with three different liquid redox electrolytes and compared its efficiency ($\eta$) with dyad. Both dyad and triad were also tested in DSSC using a polymer gel redox electrolyte and observed low efficiency because of small short circuiting current i.e. I$_{\text{Sc}}$ though the IPCE is significantly high. The probable reason for the low efficiency small I$_{\text{Sc}}$ has been attributed to the internal resistance of the cell.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of base catalysed hydrolytic cleavage of ethyl $\alpha$-cyanocinnamate (ECC) and several para-substituted ECC have been investigated spectrophotometrically in the presence of anionic surfactant sodium laurylsulphate (NaLS). The rate of cleavage of ECC was retarded by NaLS. The pseudo-first order rate constants, $k_{\text{obs}}$, correlate with the Hammett $\sigma^+_p$ – constants. The $\rho^+$ value ($0⋅86$) in aqueous medium is less than $\rho^+$ value ($1⋅11$) in $0⋅02$ M NaLS. Kinetic data were analysed by Menger–Portnoy and Piszkiwicz model. The substrate-micelle binding constants, $K_s$, correlate with the Hammett $\sigma$-constants and Hansch hydrophobicity constants – $\pi$ of the substituents.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Preparation and characterization of absolutely pure and stable nanoparticles of 5,10,15,20-meso-tetrakis phenyl porphyrin (TPP) and catalytically repute 5,10,15,20-meso-tetrakis pentaflurophenyl porphyrin (H$_2$F$_{20}$TPP) by improved ‘reprecipitation method’ is described. The innovation of this modified `reprecipitation method’ lies on the judicial selection of organic solvent and amount of porphyrin solution to be injected in the aqueous media. Exactly similar process produces relatively small nanoparticles for TPP than that of H$_2$F$_{20}$TPP while the stability of the H$_2$F$_{20}$TPP nanoparticles is bit higher than nanoparticles of TPP. Absorption and emission spectra reveal that the formation of nanoparticles for both the cases is induced by J- and H-type aggregation. DFT calculations predict the optimized geometries and frontier molecular orbital, which favours the strength of face-to-face interaction with neighbour molecules to be more facile for TPP than that of H$_2$F$_{20}$TPP helping the latter to form bigger and relatively more stable and free-standing nanoparticles. The use of no other compounds except dichloromethane, a highly volatile organic solvent and respective porphyrins give absolutely pure nanoparticles. This improved method will lead to produce organic nanoparticles of $\pi$-conjugated systems easily and efficiently.</p>

				<title>A study of nanostructured gold modified glassy carbon electrode for the determination of trace Cr(VI)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0493-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A nanostructured gold modified glassy carbon electrode (Au$_{\text{nano}}$/GCE) was employed for the determination of trace chromium(VI). To prepare Au$_{\text{nano}}$/GCE, the GCE was immersed into KAuCl$_4$ solution and electrodeposition was conducted at the potential of $–0⋅4$ V (vs Ag/AgCl) for 600 s. Scanning electron microscopy measurements show that the electrochemically synthesized gold nanoparticles were deposited in aggregated form. Any undue effects caused by the presence of foreign ions in the solution were also analysed to ensure that common interference in the determination of chromium(VI) by square wave voltammetry, do not influence the electrochemical response of the latter element. The results show that this method allows for Cr(VI) determinations with a much lower detection limit ($0⋅01$ $\mu$g $L^{–1}$) in the presence of excess of Cr(III) than the commonly used diethylenetriammine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) method. The method was applied to determine levels of chromium(VI) in tap water and sewage water.</p>

				<title>Role of carboxylate ion and metal oxidation state on the morphology and magnetic properties of nanostructured metal carboxylates and their decomposition products</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on New Directions of Research in Molecules and Materials</feature>
				<page>0521-0528</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sub-micron rods and spheres of cobalt succinate sesquihydrate and iron succinate trihydrate/pentahydrate respectively have been synthesized by the reverse micellar route. These precursors are an excellent source for the synthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. Cubes of (edge length $\tilde$ 150 nm) Fe$_3$O$_4$ and elongated particles of Fe$_2$O$_3$ ($\tilde$ diameter of 200 nm) were obtained. The role of oxidation state of the metal ion in controlling the morphology of the nanostructured dicarboxylates has been investigated. Rods with shorter length were obtained when longer chain dicarboxylate was used as ligand. Heating in nitrogen atmosphere also provided pure Co and $\alpha$-Fe nanoparticles. The Fe nanoparticles show nearly 100&#37; superparamagnetism. Temperature-dependent magnetic studies show a Morin-like transition for Fe$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles at 223 K and the Verwey transition at 115 K for Fe$_3$O$_4$ nanoparticles. Co$_3$O$_4$ nanoparticles showed antiferromagnetic ordering at 20 K.</p>

				<title>Removal of phase transfer agent leads to restricted dynamics of alkyl chains in monolayer protected clusters</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on New Directions of Research in Molecules and Materials</feature>
				<page>0537-0546</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of phase transfer agent in the dynamics of monolayer protected gold nanoparticles has been investigated by infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. The experiments were performed with octadecane thiol and dodecane thiol protected gold nanoparticles. The materials prepared were characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and IR spectroscopy. Repeated purification of the monolayer protected gold clusters made the alkyl chains defect-free. Such effects are reflected in the infrared spectra. Interdigitation of the monolayers that followed the purification leads to alkyl chains with limited mobility. This was reflected in ${}^{13}$C and ${}^{1}$H NMR linewidths. The NMR measurements indicate that the removal of phase transfer agent affects the dynamics of isolated clusters and those with interdigitated monolayers in different ways.</p>

				<title>$p$-Aminoacetanilide mediated formation of assembly of Au nanoparticles</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on New Directions of Research in Molecules and Materials</feature>
				<page>0547-0555</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, we report the formation of assembly of Au nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes in the presence of $p$-aminoacetanilide. Citrate stabilized spherical Au NPs assembled into a linear array, the extent of which depended on the concentration of $p$-aminoacetanilide in the medium. Higher concentrations led not only to the formation of longer assemblies but also branched ones. In addition, substantial fusion of NPs was observed at higher concentrations. UV-Vis spectra showed the appearance of a second peak at higher wavelength – the position of which shifted to the red with increasing concentration of $p$-aminoacetanilide. Interestingly, the second peak could not only be influenced by the concentration of $p$-aminoacetanilide but also by choosing different sizes of the spherical NPs at the initial stages. For example, when the particles were larger the shift could be observed at higher wavelengths than those starting with smaller particles. The present method allows organization of NPs into linear arrays based on the molecular properties of the `assembler’ i.e. $p$-aminoacetanilide. Also, the optical properties of the assembled NPs could be tuned with the choice of suitable sizes of the assembling NPs.</p>

				<title>Synthesis and spectroscopic study of high quality alloy Cd$_x$Zn$_{1–x}$S nanocrystals</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we report the synthesis of high quality Cd$_x$Zn$_{1–x}$S nanocrystals alloy at 150$^\circ$C with changing the composition. The shifting of absorption and emission peak in shorter wavelength is obtained with increasing the mole fraction of zinc. The quantum yield (QY) value decreases with increasing the Cd mole fraction and the values are $0⋅08$, $0⋅13$ and $0⋅40$ for Cd$_{0⋅62}$Zn$_{0⋅38}$S, Cd$_{0⋅52}$Zn$_{0⋅48}$S and Cd$_{0⋅31}$Zn$_{0⋅69}$S nanocrystals, respectively after 120 min of reaction. However, the full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) values are 45, 34 and 28 nm and the corresponding quantum yield (QY) values are $0⋅52$, $0⋅17$ and $0⋅13$ for $0⋅5$ mM, $1⋅5$ mM and 3 mM of initial S concentrations, respectively. It is interesting to note that the radiative decay time is dominating with increasing the Cd content. Analysis suggests that the decay dynamics depends on the composition of Cd$_x$Zn$_{1–x}$S nanocrystals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Inorganic (silica-titania)–organic (polyethylene oxide) hybrid films with variable refractive index (RI) values were synthesized and Ag nanoparticles were generated $\textit{in situ}$ inside such hybrid films to develop coloured coatings specially on plastic substrates. The hybrid films and the corresponding Agincorporated films were prepared from sols derived from a mixture of silicon tetraethoxide (STE), 3-(glycidoxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS), titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and silver nitrate following a sol–gel dip–coating method and cured at low temperature (90$^\circ$C), followed by UV treatment with an energy equivalent to $5⋅3 \pm 0⋅1$ J cm$^{–2}$. The equivalent SiO$_2$: SiO$_{1⋅5}$(CH$_2$)$_3$OCH$_2$CH(CH$_2$)O : TiO$_2$: Ag molar ratios (nominal) of the final cured films are varied in the ranges ($67⋅9–0$) : $29⋅1$ : ($0–67⋅9$) : 3. The refractive index values of the cured hybrid films were found to be increased systematically from $1⋅475$ to $1⋅710$ with increasing Ti-component. The Ag-SPR peak, in case of silica-polyethylene oxide host (RI = $1⋅475$), observed at 419 nm, gradually red-shifted to 497 nm upon increasing the Ticomponent (equivalent TiO2 content $67⋅9$ mol&#37;; RI = $1⋅710$) of the film. As a consequence, a systematic change of Ag-SPR position yielded yellow, yellowish–orange, orange, brownish–orange and orangish–brown coloured coatings.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, two approaches have been used for enhancing the hydrogenation properties of Pd. In the first approach, metal thin film (Cu, Ag) has been deposited over Pd and hydrogenation properties of bimetal layer Cu (thin film)/Pd(thin film) and Ag(thin film)/Pd(thin film) have been studied. In the second approach, Ag metal nanoparticles have been deposited over Pd and hydrogenation properties of Ag (nanoparticle)/Pd (thin film) have been studied and compared with Ag(thin film)/Pd(thin film) bimetal layer system. The observed hydrogen sensing response is stable and reversible over a number of hydrogen loading and deloading cycles in both bimetallic systems. Alloying between Ag and Pd is suppressed in case of Ag(nanoparticle)/Pd(thin film) bimetallic layer on annealing as compared to Ag (thin film)/Pd(thin film).</p>

					<p>A solid hybrid molecular material containing 1-butyl 3-methyl imidazolium cations and Keggin anions of phosphotungstic acid has been synthesized. It is fully characterized by CHN analysis, FTIR, XRD, UV-Vis-NIR DRS, ${}^{31}$P MAS NMR, TGA and SEM. The FTIR spectrum of the compound shows the fingerprint vibrational bands of both Keggin molecular anions and imidazolium cations. The aromatic C–H stretch region (2700–3250 cm$^{–1}$) of imidazolium cation is split due to the interaction between the ring C–H and bulky Keggin anion. The red-shift in the UV-Vis spectra and the downfield ${}^{31}$P MAS NMR chemical shift also confirm the electrostatic interaction between the ions in the compound.

					<p>We describe here an efficient phase transfer of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) from aqueous to non-aqueous media using a unique amide functionalization route, where water soluble SWNTs ($2⋅6$ mg/mL) are effectively transferred to solvents like chloroform, toluene and CS$_2$.

					<p>Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) have been functionalized by both covalent and non-covalent means. Covalent functionalization has been carried out by attaching an aliphatic amide function to DWNTs which enable solubilization in non-polar solvents. Solubilization in non-polar solvents has also been accomplished by non-covalent functionalization by using 1-pyrenebutanoicacid succinimidyl ester (PYBS). Non-covalent functionalization of DWNTs has been carried out by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyoxyethylene(40)nonylphenyl ether (IGPAL), both of which enable solubilization in aqueous media. These functionalized DWNTs have been characterized by transmission electron microscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An experimental charge density study has been carried out on proton-transfer complexes exhibiting nonlinear optical (NLO) properties–melaminium tartrate monohydrate and L-asparaginium picrate employing high-resolution X-ray diffraction at 100 K. Both the complexes crystallize in non-centric space group P2$_1$ and the structures exhibit interesting patterns of N–H$\ldots$O and O–H$\ldots$O hydrogen bonding. Experimental determination of the dipole moment ($\mu$) for the asymmetric unit reveals that for both the crystals, there is a large cooperative enhancement in the crystalline $\mu$ arising essentially due to hydrogen bond mediated charge transfer between the melaminium ion and the L-tartrate in one case, between the Lasparaginium ion and the picrate in the other complex. We have additionally performed theoretical calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level to understand the origin of enhancement of the dipole moments in the two systems.</p>

				<title>Competition between elastic and chemical effects in the intermixing of Co and Ag on Rh(111)</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on New Directions of Research in Molecules and Materials</feature>
				<page>0621-0626</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have performed $\textit{ab initio}$ density functional theory calculations to investigate the formation energy and the effects of low dimensionality and reduced coordination on the magnetic properties of pseudomorphically grown monolayers of Co–Ag surface alloys on a Rh(111) substrate. We find that if such an alloy could form, its magnetic moment would be considerably enhanced relative to that of bulk Co. However, we also find that its formation is energetically disfavoured against phase-segregated forms; this can be mainly attributed to the high `chemical’ cost of forming Ag–Co bonds. Trends in the variation of magnetic moment with alloy composition are largely consistent with the Stoner argument.</p>

				<title>Molecular modelling of a chemodosimeter for the selective detection of As(III) ion in water</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on New Directions of Research in Molecules and Materials</feature>
				<page>0627-0635</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have modelled for the first time a chemodosimeter for As(III) detection in water. The chemodosimeter modelled is a 1,3-dithiole-2-thione derivative with an anthracene unit which has been previously described as a chemodosimeter for Hg(II) detection. Quantum chemical calculations at the DFT level have been used to describe the binding energies and selectivity of the chemodosimeter. We find that the dosimeter action is intrinsically dependent on the thiophillic affinity and the coordination sphere of the metal ion. Binding studies for a series of metal ions: Pb(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), Ni(II) and As(III) followed by an analysis of the complete reaction pathway explains the high selectivity of the dosimeter towards As(III). The dosimeter efficiency is calculated as 66&#37; for As(III)-ion.</p>

				<title>Surfactant controlled switching of water-in-oil wetting behaviour of porous silica films grown at oil–water interfaces</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on New Directions of Research in Molecules and Materials</feature>
				<page>0637-0643</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Selective permeation of oil and water across a porous medium, as in oil recovery operations, depends on the preferential wetting properties of the porous medium. We show a profound influence of surfactants in wetting of porous media and thus demonstrate a new route for the control of water-in-oil wetting of porous substrates by changing the concentration of surfactants in an aqueous sub-phase below the substrate. This strategy is employed to engineer partial reversible wetting transitions on a porous silica film. The film itself is grown and stabilized on a flat, macroscopic interface between an oil phase and an aqueous sub-phase. On increasing the surfactant (CTAB) concentration in the sub-phase, contact angle of a water drop (placed on the oil side of the film) changes from 140$^\circ$ to 16$^\circ$ in 25 min by diffusion of the surfactant across the porous film. On further replacement of the sub-phase with pure water, diffusion of the surfactant from the water drop back to the sub-phase was slower, increasing the contact angle in the process from 16$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$ in 2 h. Wettability control by a cationic surfactant (CTAB) was found to be much faster (6 deg/min) than that offered by an anionic surfactant, SDS ($0.05$ deg/min). Switching of the surface wettability due to the surfactant diffusion may have implications in oil–water separation, chemical bed reactors and microfluidic devices.</p>

				<title>The role of specific interactions on dynamical processes in a room temperature ionic liquid</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0007-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes our ongoing efforts to comprehend the role of specific interactions on the dynamical processes such as rotational diffusion and photoisomerization in a typical room temperature ionic liquid. Rotational diffusion studies carried out with a pair of structurally similar non-dipolar solutes indicate that organic solutes do experience strong specific interactions even with the highly associative ionic liquids such that their rotation is hindered. Similar measurements carried out with a nonpolar and a dipolar solute in an ionic liquid and a conventional solvent reveal that even in ionic liquids, apart from the viscosity of the medium, the important parameters, which govern the solute rotation are the solvent-size and free volume in case of non-polar solutes, whereas for charged and dipolar solutes, it is the solute–solvent interaction strength. Photoisomerization studies dealing with a pair of carbocyanine derivatives have shed light on the influence of solvent viscosity and specific interactions on the rates of photoisomerization. Our results point to the fact that the positively charged as well as the negatively charged cyanine derivatives do not experience specific interactions with the ionic liquid such that the isomerization rates are affected. However, when the isomerization rates are compared with a conventional isoviscous solvent, it has been noticed that the rates of isomerization are solely governed by viscosity of the medium in case of the positively charged cyanine derivative. In contrast, photoisomerization rates of the negatively charged cyanine derivative are significantly faster in a conventional isoviscous solvent compared to the ionic liquid due to the specific interactions between the solute and the former, which lower the barrier height for isomerization.</p>

				<title>Allenylphosphonates with a 1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane ring: Synthesis, structures, stability and utility</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0023-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, structures and stability (thermal and air) of allenylphosphonates of the type (OCH$_2$CMe$_2$CH$_2$O)P(O)C(R)=C=CR'R" and [R"R'C=C=C(R)P(O)(OCH$_2$)$_2$]$_2$C are discussed. Thermally activated dimerization (cycloaddition) of (OCH$_2$CMe$_2$CH$_2$O)P(O)C(H)=C=CMe$_2$ leads to the phosphonocyclobutane [(OCH$_2$CMe$_2$CH$_2$O)P(O)C(H)=]$_2$[C–CMe$_2$]$_2$ (${\bf 18}$). Many of these allenes undergo addition of diethylamine to lead to enaminophosphonates that are readily hydrolysed by water to lead to $\beta$-ketophosphonates. The latter compounds are useful as Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons (HWE) reagents. Molecular structures of (OCH$_2$CMe$_2$CH$_2$O)P(O)C(CH$_2$OH)=C=CH$_2$ (${\bf 6}$), [H$_2$C=C=C(H)P(O)(OCH$_2$)$_2$]$_2$C (${\bf 9}$), (OCH$_2$CMe$_2$CH$_2$O)P(O)CH=C=CH$_2$ (${\bf 12}$), [(OCH$_2$CMe$_2$CH$_2$O)P(O)C(H)=]$_2$[C–CMe$_2$]$_2$ (${\bf 18}$), and the $\beta$-ketophosphonate (OCH$_2$CMe$_2$CH$_2$O)P(O)CH$_2$)–C(O)CHMe$_2$ (${\bf 24}$) have been determined. In compound ${\bf 6}$, intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the phosphoryl oxygen and the hydroxyl group leading to an infinite chain is observed. In ${\bf 6}$, there is a significant deviation (ca 7$^\circ$) from the orthogonality expected between the planes containing 4 atoms of (a) H$_2$C=C and (b) C=C(H)P in the allene part. In ${\bf 9}$, weak C–H$\ldots$O interaction between the phosphoryl oxygen atom and a CH$_2$ proton of the six-membered ring is present.</p>

				<title>Oxidation of phosphine by sulfur or selenium involving a catalytic cycle in the interconversion of monomer and tetramer forms of copper–maleonitriledithiolate complexes</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0037-0041</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The addition of triphenylphosphine (PPh$_3$), into [Et$_4$N]$_4$[Cu$_4$(mnt)$_4$] shifted its characteristic electronic spectral band at 377 nm to 372 nm which is identical to that of the monomeric species, [Et$_4$N][Cu(mnt)(PPh$_3$)]. This reaction was followed by electrochemical study and also by ${}^{31}$P NMR spectroscopy. Such interconversion with the participation of breaking of bridging copper-$\mu_3$-sulfur bond with the formation of new copper–phosphorous bond led to the development of a catalytic cycle using excess PPh$_3$ and S or Se as the reacting substrates. The turnover number for the oxidation of PPh$_3$ by S was found to be $0⋅8 \times 10^{–2} s^{–1}$ and that with Se was $0⋅6 \times 10^{–2} s^{–1}$ using this catalytic system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The novel $\textit{vic}$-dioxime ligand containing the 4-amino-1-benzyl piperidine group, $N,N'$-(4-amino-1-benzyl piperidine)-glyoxime, (LH$_2$) has been prepared from 4-amino-1-benzyl piperidine with $\textit{anti}$-dichloroglyoxime at –15$^\circ$C in absolute THF. Mononuclear Ni$^{\rm II}$ metal complex has been obtained with 1 : 2 metal/ligand ratio. The Ni$^{\rm II}$ complex of this ligand is proposed to be square planar geometry. IR spectra show that the ligand acts in a tetradentate manner and coordinates N$_4$ donor groups of LH$_2$ to Ni$^{\rm II}$ ion. The detection of H-bonding (O–H$\cdots$O) in the [Ni(LH))$_2$] (${\rm 1}$) metal complex by IR spectra supported the square-planar MN$_4$ coordination of mononuclear complex. The disappereance of H-bonding (O–H$\cdots$O) in the [Ni(L)$_2$(BPh$_2$)$_2$] (${\bf 2}$) complex shows that the BPh$^+_2$-capped groups (BPh$^+_2$ cation formed BPh$_4$ anion) attaches to the main oxime core. MN$_4$ coordination of the [Ni(LH)$_2$] (${\bf 1}$) and [Ni(L)$_2$(BPh$_2$)$_2$] (${\bf 2}$) metal complexes were also determined by ${}^1$H-NMR spectroscopy. In the trinuclear Cu$^{\rm II}$–Ni$^{\rm II}$–Cu$^{\rm II}$ metal complexes, the Ni$^{\rm II}$ ion centered into the main oxime core by the coordination of the imino groups while the two Cu$^{\rm II}$ ions coordinate dianionic oxygen donors of the oxime groups and linked to the ligands of 1,10-phenanthroline, $2,2'$-bipyridine, and $4,4'$-bipyridine. The ligand and their mono and trinuclear metal complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, UV-Vis, ${}^1$H and ${}^{13}$C-NMR spectra, magnetic susceptibility measurements, molar conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, mass spectra and X-ray powder techniques. The cyclic voltammetric results show that the cathodic peak potential of [Ni(L)$_2$(BPh$_2$)$_2$] shifted toward more negative value compared to that of [Ni(LH)$_2$], probably due to a decreasing effect of back donation of metal-oxime moieties as a result of the BPh$^+_2$-bridged complex formation. Also, the formation of the trinuclear Cu$^{\rm II}–Ni$^{\rm II}$–Cu$^{\rm II}$ metal complexes caused considerable changes on the CV behaviour of mononuclear [Ni(LH)$_2$] (${\rm 1}$) complex. The spectroelectrochemical study of [Ni(L)$_2$(BPh$_2$)$_2$] (${\rm 2}$) showed distinctive spectral changes that the intensity of the band ($\lambda$ = at 364 nm, assigned to $n \to \pi^\ast$ transitions) decreased and a new broad band in low intensity about 460 nm appeared as a result of the reduction of the nickel centered in the oxime core.</p>

					<p>Polystyrene-anchored Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), MoO$_2$(II), UO2(II), Fe(III) and Zr(IV), complexes of the unsymmetrical dibasic tetradentate ONNO donor Schiff base derived from the condensation of chloromethylated polystyrene, 3-formylsalicylic acid, ethylenediamine and 2-benzoylacetanilide (PS–LH$_2$) has been synthesized. The polystyrene anchored complexes have the formulae: PS–LM (where M = Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni, MoO$_2$, UO$_2$), PS–LFeCl⋅DMF, PS–LMn$⋅2$DMF and PS–LZr(OH)$_2⋅$DMF. The polystyrene-anchored coordination compounds have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR, reflectance, ESR and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The per cent reaction conversion of polystyrene anchored Schiff base to polystyrene supported coordination compounds lies between $28⋅98$ and $85⋅9$. The coordinated dimethylformamide is completely lost on heating the complexes. The shifts of the $ν$(C=N)(azomethine) and $ν$(C–O)(phenolic) stretches have been monitored in order to find out the donor sites of the ligands. The Cu(II) complex is paramagnetic with square planar structure; the Ni(II) complex is diamagnetic with square planar structure; the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes are diamagnetic and have tetrahedral structure; the Mn(II) and Fe(III) complexes are paramagnetic and have octahedral structure; the MoO$_2$(II) and UO$_2$(II) complexes are diamagnetic and have octahedral structure and the Zr(IV) complexes are diamagnetic and have pentagonal bipyramidal structure.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate catalysed addition of indoles to electron deficient olefins in water generated the corresponding Michael adducts in good to excellent yield. The Michael addition of indole occurred regioselectively at position 3 and the $N$-alkylated products have not been observed. The synthesized compounds were tested for their antibacterial activity against four microorganisms namely, $\textit{E. coli}$ NCIM 2931, $\textit{S. aureus}$ NCIM 5021, $\textit{P. vulgaris}$ NCIM 2813, $\textit{P. aeruginosa}$ NCIM 5029 by micro dilution method. These compounds showed MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) values in the range of $0⋅16–2⋅67$ $\mu$M.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0083-0087</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article presents a simple method towards the preparation of functionalized silver nanoparticles in a continuous medium. Silver nanoparticles were obtained through AgNO$_3$ chemical reduction in ethanol and triethylenetetramine was used to stabilize and functionalize the metal. The product was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UVvisible spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Monocrystalline silver particles with cubic structure and an average size of 20 nm were obtained. The results reveal that it is possible to synthesize Ag nanoparticles functionalized with amine groups and that particle size is influenced by the processing route.</p>

					<p>To understand the role of the sucrose/bovine serum albumin system in the biomineralization process, we have tested the influence of different concentration of the sucrose/bovine serum albumin (BSA) on calcium carbonate (CaCO$_3$) precipitation. The CaCO$_3$ crystals were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrograph (FT–IR) and powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The possible formation mechanism of CaCO$_3$ in the sucrose/bovine serum albumin system was discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Excited state intramolecular charge transfer reaction of 4-(1-azetidinyl) benzonitrile (P4C) in deuterated and normal methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile has been studied in order to investigate the solvent isotope effects on reaction rates and yields. These quantities (reaction rates and yields) along with several other properties such as quantum yield and radiative rates have been found to be insensitive to the solvent isotope substitution in all these solvents. The origin of the solvent isotope insensitivity of the reaction is discussed and correlated with the observed slowing down of the solvation dynamics upon isotope substitution.</p>

				<title>A X-ray diffraction analysis on graphene layers of Assam coal</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The so-called turbostatic structure of carbons in coal with randomly oriented stacking of the lamellae (graphene) produces intense peaks, which are the dominant features in its X-ray diffraction profiles. The diffractogram may be conveniently divided into two regions of reciprocal space, the medium S region (1 &lt; S &lt; 3 &#197;) and a high S region (S &gt; 3 &#197;) where $S = 4\pi \lambda^{–1} \sin \theta$. To better understand the molecular level structure of high sulphur Assam coal, two coal samples (Tirap-1 and Tirap-2) from Tirap colliery of Makum coalfield, Assam (India) has been interpreted in this study by using the X-ray diffraction profiles. Random layered (graphene) structural parameters of these coals were determined by using X-ray diffraction technique, which showed that the $L_a$ and $L_c$ are $64⋅99$ &#197;  and $22⋅63$ &#197; for Tirap-2 and $55⋅54$ &#197; and $23⋅80$ &#197; for that of Tirap-1 coals respectively. The position of $\gamma$ band was found to be at $4⋅34$ &#197; and $4⋅13$ &#197; for Tirap-2 and Tirap-1 coals respectively. The number of layers and average number of carbon atoms (N) per aromatic graphene were found to be 21 and 8 for both the coal samples. Proximate, ultimate and ash analysis of the two coal samples were also carried out in this investigation.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0155-0161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) undergoes facile electron transfer reaction with vanadium (V) substituted Keggin-type heteropolyanions (HPA) [PV$^V$W$_{11}$O$_{40}$]$^{4–}$ (PV$_1$) and [PV$^V_2$W$_{10}$O$_{40}$]$^{5–}$ (PV$_2$) in aqueous phosphate buffer of pH 6 at ambient temperature. Electrochemical and optical studies show that the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1 : 2 (NADH : HPA). EPR and optical studies show that HPA act as one electron acceptor and the products of electron transfer reactions are one electron reduced heteropoly blues (HPB), viz. [PV$^{IV}$W$_{11}$O$_{40}$]$^{5–}$ and [PV$^{IV}$V$^V$W$_{10}$O$_{40}$]$^{6–}$. Oxygraph measurements show that there is no uptake of molecular oxygen during the course of reaction. The reaction proceeds through multi-step electron–proton–electron transfer mechanism, with rate limiting initial one electron transfer from NADH to HPA by outer sphere electron transfer process. Bimolecular rate constant for electron transfer reaction between NADH and PV$_2$ in phosphate buffer of pH = 6 has been determined spectrophotometrically.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new series of homo- and heteropolynuclear copper(II) complexes of N,N"-$bis$[1-biphenyl-2-hydroxyimino-2-(4-acetylanilino)-1-ethylidene]-diamines have been prepared and characterized by different physical techniques. The starting point of the research was the reaction of chloroacetyl chloride with biphenyl in the presence of aluminum chloride. 4-Biphenylhydroximoyl chloride was obtained by reacting synthesized 4-(chloroacetyl)biphenyl with alkyl nitrite. Substituted 4-(alkylaminoisonitrosoacetyl) biphenyl (ketooxime) was prepared by reacting 4-biphenylhydroximoyl chloride with 4-aminoacetophenone in EtOH. Homodi-, homotrinuclear and heterodinuclear copper(II) perchlorate complexes of tetradentate Schiff bases which possess N$_4$ donor sets derived from the condensation of 4-(arylaminoisonitrosoacetyl)biphenyl and diamine derivatives were synthesized and characterized. Elemental analysis, FT–IR, ESR, molar conductivity, magnetic moment measurements and thermal analyses studies were utilized for the investigation of the complexes. The free ligands were also characterized by ${}^1$H- and ${}^{13}$C-NMR spectra. Elemental analyses, stoichiometric and spectroscopic data of the metal complexes indicated that the metal:ligand ratio of dinuclear copper(II) complexes were found to be 2 : 1 while this ratio was 3 : 2 in trinuclear copper(II) complexes and the metal complexes indicated that the metal ions are coordinated to the oxime and imine nitrogen atoms. The extraction abilities of the novel ligands were also evaluated in chloroform by using several transition metal picrates such as Mn$^{2+}$, Co$^{2+}$, Ni$^{2+}$, Cu$^{2+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, Pb$^{2+}$, Cd$^{2+}$, Hg$^{2+}$. It has been observed that both ligands show a high affinity to Cu$^{2+}$ ions.</p>

				<title>Magnetism of carbon doped Mn$_5$Si$_3$ and Mn$_5$Ge$_3$ films</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0173-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The magnetic properties of Mn$_5$Si$_3$C$_x$ and Mn$_5$Ge$_3$C$_x$ films prepared by magnetron cosputtering or C$^+$-ion implantation are studied. The carbon-doped films exhibit ferromagnetic properties with Curie temperatures $T_C$ well above room temperature and metallic conductivity, making them possible candidates for future magnetic semiconductor-based devices. In Mn$_5$Si$_3$C$_x$, the carbon gives rise to a lattice expansion and a concomitant change of the magnetic order from antiferromagnetic Mn$_5$Si$_3$ to ferromagnetic Mn$_5$Si$_3$C$_{0.8}$ with $T_C$ = 350 K. Likewise, $T_C$ of ferromagnetic Mn$_5$Ge$_3$ is strongly enhanced in Mn$_5$Ge$_3$C$_{0⋅8}$. However, in this case the lattice is slightly compressed by carbon. This demonstrates that the effect of carbon on the magnetic behaviour in these compounds is not simply due to a change of the various interatomic distances by carbon but also due to a modification of the electronic band structure.</p>

				<title>Kinetics and correlation analysis of reactivity in the oxidation of organic sulfides by butyltriphenylphosphonium dichromate</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0189-0197</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of a number of monosubstituted aryl methyl, alkyl phenyl, dialkyl, and diphenyl sulfides by butyltriphenylphosphonium dichromate (BTPPD), to the corresponding sulfoxides, is first order with respect to BTPPD and is second order with respect to sulfide. The reaction is catalysed by hydrogen ions and the dependence is of second order. The oxidation of $\textit{meta}$- and $\textit{para}$-substituted aryl methyl sulfides correlated best in terms of Hammett equation, the reactions exhibited negative polar reaction constant. The $\textit{ortho}$-substituted compounds correlated best in terms of Charton’s triparametric equation with negative polar constant and a small degree of steric hindrance. The oxidation of alkyl phenyl sulfides exhibited a good correlation in terms of Pavelich–Taft equation confirming that the electron-donating power of the alkyl group increases the rate, however, the reactivity is not markedly controlled by the bulkiness of the alkyl group. The rates of oxidation of sulfides were determined in nineteen organic solvents. An analysis of the solvent effect by multi-parametric equations indicated the relatively greater importance of the cation-solvating power of the solvents. A mechanism involving a single-step electrophilic oxygen transfer from BTPPD to the sulfide leading to polar transition state has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Isopropylation of toluene with isopropyl alcohol was studied over the large pore silicon alumino phosphate molecular sieves (SAPO-5) with varying Si content. Toluene conversion was found to increase with increase in the Si of the catalysts. The effect of temperature on yields of cymene was studied in the range of 453 to 553 K. The highest yield and selectivity for cymene was observed at 513 K. Good cymene selectivity was confirmed with the absence of $n$-propyl toluene in the product. The catalyst activity, in terms of $p$-cymene selectivity, remained almost stable during a nine hour time on stream run. Enhanced cymene selectivity and decreased $p$-cymene selectivity was observed with increase in the toluene to isopropyl alcohol feed mole ratio from 2 to 8. Power law model and L–H–H–W model fitted the experimental data well and are used to explain the kinetics of this reaction.</p>

				<title>Voltammetric behaviour of levodopa and its quantification in pharmaceuticals using a $\beta$-cyclodextrine doped poly (2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid) modified electrode</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>A cyclic voltammetric method based on a $\beta$-cyclodextrine doped poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was developed for the determination of levodopa. Compared with bare GCE and poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)/GCE, the poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)-$\beta$-cyclodextrine/GCE exhibits a remarkable shift of the oxidation potentials of levodopa in the cathodic direction and a drastic enhancement of the anodic current response. The incorporation of $\beta$-cyclodextrine into the polymer film exhibited that the electrode provides more stable and sensitive current responses for levodopa. Levodopa exhibited a single broad peak at about $0⋅6$ V at bare GCE. However, at the $\beta$-cyclodextrine doped poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)/GCE, a well-defined redox wave of levodopa was obtained, with the oxidation and the reduction peak potential at $0⋅193$ and $0⋅164$ V, respectively. The separation of peak potentials was 29 mV. The linear current response was obtained in the range of $1⋅0 \times  10^{–6} \tilde 2⋅0 \tilde 10^{–4}$ M with a detection limit of $4⋅18 \tilde 10^{–7}$ M for levodopa, The poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)-$\beta$-cyclodextrine/GCE was also effective to simultaneously detect levodopa and ascorbic acid. The modified electrode has been successfully applied for the determination of levodopa in pharmaceuticals. The poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)-$\beta$-cyclodextrine/GCE showed excellent stability and reproducibility.</p>

				<title>Linear sweep voltammetric studies on the supramolecular complex of alizarin red S with lysozyme and determination of lysozyme</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0217-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An electrochemical method for the determination of lysozyme (LYS) based on its interaction with alizarin red S (ARS) was established by linear sweep voltammetry in this paper. The electrochemical behaviour of ARS with LYS was investigated on a dropping mercury working electrode in $0⋅2$ mol/L pH $4⋅8$ Britton-Robinson (B–R) buffer solution. ARS showed a sensitive second order derivative linear sweep voltammetric reductive peak at $–0⋅42$ V (vs SCE). After the addition of LYS, the reductive peak current of ARS decreased without the shift of the reductive peak potential and no new waves appeared, which was due to the formation of a supramolecular complex of ARS with LYS in the solution. The stoichiometry of the ARS–LYS complex was further calculated by the electrochemical data with the results of the binding ratio as 3 : 1 and the binding constant as $2⋅82 \times 10^{14}$. Under the selected conditions, the decrease of the second order derivative linear sweep voltammetric reductive peak current of ARS was in proportion to the LYS concentration in the range from $0⋅8$ to $35⋅0$ mg/L and the detection limit of LYS was calculated as $0⋅52$ mg/L (3$\sigma$). Different kinds of LYS samples were detected satisfactorily with this method.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The nitrogen (N)-doped carbon (CN$_x$) nanotubes were synthesized by pyrolysis of ethylenediamine with Ni$_{1⋅07}$Mg$_{1⋅01}$AlO$_{3⋅58}$, Ni$_{1⋅99}$Mg$_{0⋅29}$AlO$_{3⋅78}$, and Ni$_{2⋅31}$Mg$_{0⋅08}$AlO$_{3⋅89}$ mixed oxides as catalysts at 650$^\circ$C. Those mixed oxides were obtained by calcination of corresponding layered double hydroxide precursors (LDHs). Structure and composition of LDHs and mixed oxides were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Inductively coupled plasma spectrum. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope were used to characterize the N content, proportion of pyridine-like N structure and morphology of CN$_x$ nanotubes. The results showed that the tubes grown with Ni$_{2⋅31}$Mg$_{0⋅08}$AlO$_{3⋅89}$ as catalysts had more obvious bamboo-like structure, larger diameter than those grown with Ni$_{1⋅07}$Mg$_{1⋅01}$AlO$_{3⋅58}$ and Ni$_{1⋅99}$Mg$_{0⋅29}$AlO$_{3⋅78}$. The N content and proportion of graphitic-like N structures increased with the content of Ni$^{2+}$ increasing in LDH precursors. The morphology, N content and pyridine-like N structures for CN$_x$ nanotubes can be controlled to a certain extent by varying the content of Ni$^{2+}$ in LDH precursors.</p>

				<title>Quest for new materials: Inorganic chemistry plays a crucial role</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0235-0256</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is an endless quest for new materials to meet the demands of advancing technology. Thus, we need new magnetic and metallic/semiconducting materials for spintronics, new low-loss dielectrics for telecommunication, new multi-ferroic materials that combine both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism for memory devices, new piezoelectrics that do not contain lead, new lithium containing solids for application as cathode/anode/electrolyte in lithium batteries, hydrogen storage materials for mobile/transport applications and catalyst materials that can convert, for example, methane to higher hydrocarbons, and the list is endless! Fortunately for us, chemistry – inorganic chemistry in particular – plays a crucial role in this quest. Most of the functional materials mentioned above are inorganic non-molecular solids, while much of the conventional inorganic chemistry deals with isolated molecules or molecular solids. Even so, the basic concepts that we learn in inorganic chemistry, for example, acidity/basicity, oxidation/reduction (potentials), crystal field theory, low spin-high spin/inner sphere-outer sphere complexes, role of $d$-electrons in transition metal chemistry, electron-transfer reactions, coordination geometries around metal atoms, Jahn–Teller distortion, metal–metal bonds, cation–anion (metal–nonmetal) redox competition in the stabilization of oxidation states – all find crucial application in the design and synthesis of inorganic solids possessing technologically important properties. An attempt has been made here to illustrate the role of inorganic chemistry in this endeavour, drawing examples from the literature as well as from the research work of my group.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reaction of 1,3-diaryltriazenes (abbreviated in general as HL-R, where R stands for the $\textit{para}$-substituent in the aryl fragment and H stands for the dissociable hydrogen atom, R = OCH$_3$, CH$_3$, H, Cl, NO$_2$) with [Rh(PPh$_3$)$_2$(CO)Cl] in ethanol in the presence of NEt$_3$ produces a series of trisdiaryltriazenide complexes of rhodium of type [Rh(L-R)$_3$], where the triazenes are coordinated to rhodium as monoanionic, bidentate N,N-donors. Structure of the [Rh(L-OCH$_3$)$_3$] complex has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The complexes are diamagnetic, and show characteristic ${}^1$H NMR signals and intense MLCT transitions in the visible region. They also fluoresce in the visible region under ambient condition while excited at around 400 nm. Cyclic voltammetry on these complexes shows a Rh(III)–Rh(IV) oxidation (within $0⋅84–1⋅67$ V vs SCE), followed by an oxidation of the coordinated triazene ligand (except the R = NO$_2$ complex). An irreversible reduction of the coordinated triazene is also observed for all the complexes below $–1⋅03$ V vs SCE.</p>

				<title>Synthesis and structural characterization of a novel peroxo bridged dinuclear cobalt(III) complex of succinimide showing three varieties of hydrogen bonding interactions</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0267-0273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of aqueous cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate with the anion of succinimide (sucH) in the presence of excess ethylenediamine (en) in air results in the formation of a dinuclear complex $\mu$-peroxo-$bis$[$bis$(ethylenediamine)succinimidato-cobalt(III)] dinitrate dihydrate, ${\bf 1}$, in good yield. Compound ${\bf 1}$ was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, visible spectra and magnetic susceptibility studies. The explosive nature of [Co(en)$_2$(suc)($\mu$-O$_2$)Co(en)$_2$(suc)](NO$_3$)$_2⋅2$H$_2$O, ${\bf 1}$, precluded its thermal characterization. Compound ${\bf 1}$ crystallises in the monoclinic space group $P2_1/c$ and a half of the molecule, constitutes its asymmetric unit. In the centrosymmetric dinuclear complex ${\bf 1}$, two Co(III) centres are linked by a planar peroxide bridge. Each cobalt atom is surrounded by four nitrogen atoms of ethylenediamine ligands, a nitrogen atom of succinimidato anion and an oxygen atom of peroxo bridge resulting in a slightly distorted $\{$CoN$_5$O$\}$ octahedron. Due to steric hindrance between the two Co(III) centres, the peroxide bridge is planar with a Co–O–O–Co torsion angle of 180$^\circ$. The dinuclear complex cation, the nitrate anion and the lattice water are involved in three varieties of H-bonding interactions namely N–H$\cdots$O, O–H$\cdots$O and C–H$\cdots$O.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0275-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of Ru(III) catalysed oxidation of L-lysine by diperiodatoargentate (III) (DPA) in alkaline medium at 298 K and a constant ionic strength of $0⋅50$ mol dm–3 was studied spectrophotometrically. The oxidation products are aldehyde (5-aminopentanal) and Ag (I). The stoichiometry is i.e. [L-lysine] : [DPA] = 1 : 1. The reaction is of first order in [Ru(III)] and [DPA] and is less than unit order in both [L-lys] and [alkali]. Addition of periodate had a retarding effect on the reaction. The oxidation reaction in alkaline medium has been shown to proceed via a Ru(III)-L-lysine complex, which further reacts with one molecule of monoperiodatoargentate(III) (MPA) in a rate determining step followed by other fast steps to give the products. The main products were identified by spot test, IR, GC-MS studies. The activation parameters with respect to slow step of the mechanism are computed and discussed and thermodynamic quantities are also determined. The active species of catalyst and oxidant have been identified.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Lanthanum-substituted strontium-oxybritholites, Sr$_{10–x}$La$_x$(PO$_4$)$_{6–x}$(SiO$_4$)$_{x}$O with $x = 0$, 2 and 4, prepared by solid state reaction were investigated by chemical analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, Raman and ${}^{29}$Si MAS NMR spectroscopies. The refinements of powder XRD patterns of the substituted compounds by the Rietveld method showed that the lanthanum occupied the two metal sites, i.e. (4f) and (6h) sites into the apatite structure, with a clear preference for the (6h) sites. A progressive shift of the free oxygen O(4) towards the centre of the triangles formed by the metal–atoms in the (6h) positions was observed when the lanthanum content increased. It led to the formation of a Sr/La(2)–O(4) strong bond, which might have increased the stability of these compounds. The bands of Raman spectra were assigned to the vibration modes of PO$_4$ and SiO$_4$ groups. The comparison of the results of ${}^{29}$Si MAS NMR analysis with those obtained with the ${}^{31}$P previously reported, suggested that both species occupied the same crystallographic sites.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0309-0315</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Picosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements have been carried out on 9,9'-bianthryl in three imidazolium ionic liquids to probe the excited state dynamics. In the early time-scale, the fluorescence spectra of bianthryl have been found to consist of emission from both locally excited (LE) and charge transfer (CT) states. The LE $\to$ CT relaxation time, as estimated from the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the LE emission, is found to vary between 230 and 390 ps, while the average solvent relaxation time, as estimated from the analysis of time-dependent fluorescence Stokes shift, is found to vary between 620 ps and 1840 ps, depending on the viscosity of the ionic liquids. The results confirm that while in conventional less viscous solvents the CT formation kinetics of bianthryl occurs simultaneously with the solvation dynamics, in ionic liquids the two processes mostly occur in different time scales.</p>

					<p>Mesoporous titania was synthesized by a sol–gel method using the surfactants Span85 and X114 as the template. The pore structure was determined by the N$_2$ adsorption/desorption method below 73 K and calculated using the BJH model. TEM characterizations show that the pores are formed through particle accumulation. Two kinds of channels, straight channels made of cylindrical capillaries and curved channels made of slit-shaped pores, exist in the bulk materials. The influence of the pore structure of mesoporous TiO$_2$ on its photocatalytic performance was studied. The sample with higher porosity, better textural properties and straight channels are good for photocatalytic performance.</p>

				<title>Temperature dependence studies on the electro-oxidation of aliphatic alcohols with modified platinum electrodes</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0329-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Temperature dependence on the electro-oxidation of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol in $0⋅5$ M H$_2$SO$_4$ were investigated with Pt and PtRu electrodes. Tafel slope and apparent activation energy were evaluated from the cyclic voltammetric data in the low potential region ($0⋅3–0⋅5$ V vs SHE). The CV results provided Tafel slopes for alcohols in the range of 200–400 mV dec$^{–1}$ which indicated a difference in the rate determining step. The decrease in Tafel slope was only observed in the case of methanol for the Ru-modified Pt electrode. This indicates that Ru improves the rate of determining step for methanol while hindering it for the other alcohols. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was also used to evaluate the electro-oxidation mechanism of alcohols on these electrodes. The simulated EIS results provided two important parameters: charge transfer resistance ($R_{ct}$) and inductance ($L$). The $R^{–1}_{ct}$ and $L^{–1}$ represent the rate of alcohol electro-oxidation and rate of desorption of intermediate species, respectively. These values increased with the increasing of temperature. The results from two techniques were well agreed that the electro-oxidation of methanol was improved by raising the temperature and ruthenium modification.</p>

				<title>A comparative study of electrochemical reduction of isatin and its synthesized Schiff bases at HMDE</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0347-0351</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electrochemical behaviour of a series of Schiff base i.e. 3-[5-phenylpyrazol-3-ylimino]indol-2-ones (IIa–e) synthesized by the reaction of various 5-substituted isatins with 3-amino-5-phenyl-pyrazole has been investigated and compared with corresponding isatin in dimethylformamide in $0⋅1$ M LiCl using cyclic voltammetry at Hanging Mercury Drop Electrode. All synthesized Schiff bases exhibit a single irreversible two-electron reduction wave in contrast with the two discrete one-electron transfer reduction waves observed for isatin in this medium. Observation of a well-developed single reduction wave can be attributed to the higher basicity of the nitrogen species of the imine bond of Schiff bases, making proton abstraction as well as second electron transfer both rapid. The compounds are subjected to constant potential preparative electrolysis. The products are identified as secondary amines by spectroscopic methods. A mechanism for the electro-reduction process has been proposed. Kinetic parameters have also been calculated.</p>

				<title>Surface reactivity and layer analysis of chemisorbed reaction films in the surface-chemical environment of alkyl octadecenoates</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0353-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Studies on surface reactivity of substrate iron (Fe-particles) were made in the tribo-chemical environment of alkyl octadecenoates. Two alkyl octadecenoates namely ethyl octadecenoate and methyl 12-hydroxy octadecenoate, slightly different in their chemical nature, were taken for preparing the chemisorbed reaction films (CRF) at the temperature $100 \pm 5^\circ$C. The reaction products collected in the composite (amorphous) phase were isolated into three different solvent–soluble fractions (sub-layer films) using polar solvents of increasing polar strength. The FTIR analysis of these films showed that these were primarily organic in nature and were composed of alkyl and/or aryl hydroxy ethers, unsaturated hydroxy ketones, and aromatic structures chemically linked with iron surface. These reaction films also contained large amount of iron (Fe). Further, these film fractions also showed varying thermal behaviour during thermal decomposition in the temperature range of $50–800^\circ$C when thermally evaluated in the nitrogen environment.</p>

				<title>Application of the Kirkwood–Buff theory of solutions to acetonitrile + amide binary mixtures by using inversion procedure and regular solution theory</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0361-0367</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kirkwood–Buff (K–B) integrals play an important role in characterizing the intermolecular interactions in liquid mixtures. These are represented by the K–B parameters, $G_{\text{AA}}$, $G_{\text{BB}}$, and $G_{\text{AB}}$, which reflect correlation between like–like and like–unlike species in the mixture. The K–B integrals of binary mixtures of acetonitrile (ACN) with formamide (FA), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylacetamide (NMA) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) at $298⋅15$ K and at atmospheric pressure have been computed from the experimental data of ultrasonic speed and density. We have used the similar inverse procedure (as proposed by Ben–Naim) to compute the K–B Parameters of the mixtures, in which thermodynamic information on mixtures such as partial molar volumes, isothermal compressibility, and experimental data of partial vapour pressures are used. A new route has been incorporated by using regular solution theory in the computation of excess free energy for obtaining the partial vapour pressures of binary liquid mixtures. The low values of excess entropy ($S^E \approx 0$) obtained for these mixtures indicate the applicability of regular solution theory to these mixtures. The results obtained regarding intermolecular interaction in all the four mixtures under study from this new procedure are in good agreement with those obtained from the trends exhibited by the excess functions of these mixtures.</p>

				<title>A water soluble heteropolyoxotungstate as a selective, efficient and environment friendly oxidation catalyst</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0377-0385</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of water soluble Keggin type heteropolyoxotungstates have been tested as oxidation catalysts in aqueous-biphasic media with dilute H$_2$O$_2$ (30&#37;) as the oxygen atom donor, without using any phase transfer agent. The Zn substituted polyoxoanion $\{$(NH$_4$)$_7$Zn$_{0⋅5}$[$\alpha$-ZnO$_4$W$_{11}$O$_{30}$ZnO$_5$(OH$_2$)]$⋅n$H$_2$O$\}$ has been found to be the most efficient catalyst, which oxidizes a wide range of organic functionalities with good turnovers and high selectivities. The functionalities that undergo oxidations are: organic sulfides, pyridines, anilines, benzyl alcohols and benzyl halides. The oxidations of sulfides to sulfoxides and/or sulfones have been studied in detail, and a simple kinetic model consisting of two consecutive reactions, is shown to give good fit with the experimental data. In the catalytic system described here product isolation is easy, and the aqueous catalyst solution can be re-used several times with little loss in its efficiency.</p>

				<title>Iridium mediated phenolic O–H activation and cyclometalation of 2-(naphthyl-1'-azo)-4-methylphenol – Formation of organoiridium complexes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0387-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reaction of 2-(naphthyl-1'-azo)-4-methylphenol with [Ir(PPh$_3$)$_3$Cl] in refluxing ethanol in the presence of a base (NEt3) affords an organoiridium complex of type [Ir(PPh$_3$)$_2$(L)(H)], where L represents the coordinated 2-(naphthyl-1'-azo)-4-methylphenolate ligand. A similar reaction carried out in toluene affords the [Ir(PPh$_3$)$_2$(L)(H)] complex along with a similar complex of type [Ir(PPh$_3$)$_2$(L)Cl]. Structures of both the [Ir(PPh$_3$)$_2$(L)(H)] and [Ir(PPh$_3$)$_2$(L)Cl] complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In both the complexes, 2-(naphthyl-1'-azo)-4-methylphenol is coordinated to iridium, via C–H activation at the 2' position of the naphthyl ring, as a dianionic tridentate C, N, O-donor and the two triphenylphosphines are $\textit{trans}$. The organoiridium complexes show intense MLCT transitions in the visible region. Cyclic voltammetry on the [Ir(PPh3)2(L)(H)] and [Ir(PPh3)2(L)Cl] complexes shows a reversible Ir(III)–Ir(IV) oxidation respectively at $0⋅55$ and $0⋅73$ V vs SCE. An irreversible oxidation of the coordinated 2-(naphthyl-1'-azo)-4-methylphenolate ligand is observed above $1⋅0$ V vs SCE and an irreversible reduction of the same is observed near $–1⋅0$ V vs SCE.</p>

					<p>A novel polypyridyl ligand phenyl-(4,5,9,14-tetraaza-benzo[$b$]triphenylen-1,1-$yl$)-methanone (PTBM) and its complexes [Ru(phen)$_2$(PTBM)]$^{2+}$ (${\bf 1}$) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) and [Ru(bpy)$_2$ (PTBM)]$^{2+}$ (${\bf 2}$) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, and ${}^1$H NMR. The DNA-binding properties of the two complexes were investigated by spectroscopic and viscosity measurements. The results indicate that both complexes bind to DNA via an intercalative mode and the DNA-binding affinity of complex ${\bf 1}$ is greater than that of complex ${\bf 2}$. When irradiated at 365 nm, complex ${\bf 1}$ was found to be a more-effective DNA-cleaving agent than complex ${\bf 2}$.</p>

					<p>A fully conjugated ligand 4,4'-$bis$(1,10-phenanthroline-[5,6-d]imidazole-2-yl)-biphenyl (BPIBP) based on 1,10-phenanthroline and biphenyl groups was firstly synthesized.

				<abstract>
					<p>The synthesis and characterization of a series of N–Zn, N–Cu complexes with 2-amino pyridine and ethylenediamine ligands (1a–b and 2a–b) have been described. They were synthesized with a simple, one-pot method, and the crystal structures of 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b were determined by X-ray crystallography. The complexes were also characterized by NMR, IR, and elemental analysis. They were used as the catalysts in an application to the Henry reaction, and high yields were obtained under the optimum conditions.</p>

					<p>Antiepileptic drug lamotrigine and its thirteen ammonium salt complexes ($\textbf{4a–4m}$) were synthesized and characterized by IR, elemental analysis, ${}^1$H-NMR, and MS spectral methods. Many of the ammonium salts ($\textbf{4a–4m}$) were first reported. Furthermore, the crystal structure of compound $\textbf{3}$ was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All these complexes were tested $\textit{in vitro}$ for their antibacterial activity $\textit{(Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae})$. The results indicated that most of the complexes showed good antibacterial activity against Gram-positive ($\textit{B. subtilis, S. aureus and S. faecalis}$), but showed mild, even inactive against Gram-negative bacterial strains.</p>

					<p>New substituted trichostatic acid derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for their biological activities towards the H661 non-small lung cancer cell line. These syntheses were achieved by alkylation of propiophenones to introduce the side chain with a terminal precursor of hydroxamic acid and aminobenzamide derivatives. The first fluorinated derivatives of trichostatic acid are described, such as 6-fluoro trichostatin A, with antiproliferative activities in the micromolar range and with histone deacetylase inhibitory activity.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0509-0514</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Curcumin is a widely used therapeutic agent with a wide spectrum of biological and physiological applications like wound healing and interacts with the skin protein, collagen. This work reports the effect of curcumin on various physico-chemical properties of collagen. The results suggest that significant changes in viscosity and surface tension occur on collagen interacting with curcumin. Secondary structure analysis using circular dichroism shows that curcumin does not alter the triple helical structure of collagen. Increasing concentration of curcumin resulted in aggregation of the protein. Further, curcumin imparts high level of thermal stability to collagen with shrinkage temperature of collagen increasing from 60 to 90$^\circ$C.</p>

				<title>Quantitative measurement of mixtures by terahertz time–domain spectroscopy</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0515-0520</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Terahertz time–domain spectroscopy (THz–TDS) was applied for quantitatively analysing a series of binary mixtures and a ternary mixture. Binary mixtures having different weight ratios of two components, $m$-aminophenol and m-nitroaniline, were investigated by THz–TDS in the range of $0⋅3$ to $1⋅5$ THz, and it was found that the absorption coefficients of the components in each mixture were linearly proportional to their concentrations in the mixture. The results from analysis were in agreement with actual values with a relative error of less than 7&#37;. The quantitative method will help in the detection of illegal drugs, poisons and dangerous materials that are wrapped or mixed with other materials.</p>

				<title>Solution structure of loperamide and $\beta$-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes using NMR spectroscopy</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0521-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Loperamide (LPR) is a synthetic, poorly water soluble, peripherally acting opiate agonist drug used for the treatment of diarrhea. Major challenges in formulating this drug for clinical applications include solubility enhancement and improved stability in biological systems. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are chiral, truncated cone shaped; cyclic oligosaccharides that can encapsulate a variety of poorly water soluble drug molecules into inclusion complexes, thereby increasing their stability and solubility. ${}^1$H NMR spectroscopic studies showed the inclusion complexation between $\beta$-CD and LPR, based on the upfield shift changes in the $\beta$-CD cavity protons (H-3' and H-5') and downfield shift changes in the guest (LPR) protons. 2D COSY spectral data was used for assignment of $\beta$-CD as well as LPR protons and 2D ROESY spectral data to know the inclusion of LPR inside the $\beta$-CD cavity. The 1 : 1 stoichiometry and overall association constant ($K_a$) were determined by using Scott’s plot method to be $68⋅805$ M$^{–1}$. 2D ROESY spectral data suggest that the inclusion of aromatic rings of LPR in $\beta$-CD cavity can be from narrower as well as the wider rim side and the six possible 1 : 1 LPR : $\beta$-CD inclusion complexes have been proposed. Thus, we anticipate that complexation of LPR with $\beta$-CD would increase its solubility and stability in biological system.</p>

				<title>Guest–host interactions in the alkaline bleaching of triphenylmethane dyes catalysed by $\beta$-cyclodextrin</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0529-0534</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rates of alkaline bleaching of triphenylmethane dyes crystal violet (CV), malachite green (MG) and rosaniline (RA) have been measured spectrophotometrically in an aqueous medium at 30$^\circ$C in the presence of $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD). At lower concentrations of CD, CV forms productive 1 : 1 (G : H) complex. At higher concentrations of CD, it forms unproductive 1 : 2 (G : H) complex. For the bleaching of MG, CD accelerates or decelerates the rate depending on pH of the medium by forming 1 : 1 (G : H) inclusion complex. Analysis of rate data shows that MG undergoes fading by mixed order process. CD decelerates the water reaction and accelerates hydroxide ion reaction. In the case of RA, both water reaction as well as hydroxide ion reaction are retarded by CD by the formation of inclusion complex.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The rate of glucose equivalent production in C$_4$ green plants is investigated as a function of the intercellular partial pressure of CO$_2$, so as to find the precise physical chemistry of photosynthesis. Expressions are first formulated for the dependence of photochemical efficiency and of rubisco activation on pressure. Then a pressure-dependent rate law is derived. The latter is successfully tested for two specific C$_4$ plants, namely, $\textit{Panicum antidotale and}$ $\textit{Panicum coloratum}$.</p>

				<title>Test of theoretical models for ultrafast heterogeneous electron transfer with femtosecond two-photon photoemission data</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0561-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The energy distribution of electrons injected into acceptor states on the surface of TiO$_2$ was measured with femtosecond two-photon photoemission. Shape and relative energetic position of these distribution curves with respect to the corresponding donor states, i.e. of perylene chromophores in the first excited singlet state attached via different bridge–anchor groups to the TiO$_2$ surface, were compared with the predictions of different theoretical models for light-induced ultrafast heterogeneous electron transfer (HET). Gerischer’s early scenario for light-induced HET was considered and two recent explicit calculations, i.e. a fully quantum mechanical analytical model and a time-dependent density functional theory model based on molecular dynamics simulations for the vibrational modes were also considered. Based on the known vibrational structure in the photoionization spectrum of perylene in the gas phase and that measured in the linear absorption spectra of the perylene chromophores anchored on the TiO$_2$ surface the energy distribution curves for the injected electrons were fitted assuming the excitation of the dominant $0⋅17$ eV vibrational mode in the ionized perylene chromophore leading to a corresponding Franck–Condon dictated progression in the energy distribution curves. Each individual peak was fitted with a Voigt profile where the Lorentzian contribution was taken from the time-resolved HET data and the Gaussian contribution attributed to inhomogeneous broadening. The measured room temperature energy distribution curves for the injected electrons are explained with the fully quantum mechanical model for light-induced HET with the high energy, $0⋅17$ eV, skeletal stretching mode excited in the ionized perylene chromophore. The corresponding energy distribution of the injected electrons is fully accommodated in acceptor states on the TiO$_2$ surface fulfilling the wide band limit.</p>

Particular attention has been paid to the structure of the $d$-band.

				<title>Generalized Warburg impedance on realistic self-affine fractals: Comparative study of statistically corrugated and isotropic roughness</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0579-0588</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyse the problem of impedance for a diffusion controlled charge transfer process across an irregular interface. These interfacial irregularities are characterized as two class of random fractals: (i) a statistically isotropic self-affine fractals and (ii) a statistically corrugated self-affine fractals. The information about the realistic fractal surface roughness has been introduced through the bandlimited power-law power spectrum over limited wave numbers. The details of power spectrum of such roughness can be characterized in term of four fractal morphological parameters, viz. fractal dimension ($D_H$), lower ($\ell$), and upper ($L$) cut-off length scales of fractality, and the proportionality factor ($\mu$) of power spectrum. Theoretical results are analysed for the impedance of such rough electrode as well as the effect of statistical symmetries of roughness. Impedance response for irregular interface is simplified through expansion over intermediate frequencies. This intermediate frequency expansion with sufficient number of terms offers a good approximation over all frequency regimes. The Nyquist plots of impedance show the strong dependency mainly on three surface morphological parameters i.e. $D_H$, $\ell$ and $\mu$. We can say that our theoretical results also provide an alternative explanation for the exponent in intermediate frequency power-law form.</p>

					<p>Electron transfer from a molecular level to empty continuum levels of a substrate is described theoretically. Using a quasicontinuum approach to model the substrate, analytical expressions pertaining to the time-dependent probability among the various levels of the substrate is presented along with its extension to coherently excited molecular vibrational modes. Hidden time scales and dynamics are revealed in the analysis and possible experiments to observe the new results are suggested. We note the applicability of the model to the description of a variety of other phenomena that are formally similar to the electron injection problem, although pertaining to different physics.</p>

					<p>The partition function for one-dimensional nearest neighbour Ising models is estimated by summing all the energy terms in the Hamiltonian for N sites. The algebraic expression for the partition function is then employed to deduce the eigenvalues of the basic $2 \times 2$ matrix and the corresponding Hermitian Toeplitz matrix is derived using the Discrete Fourier Transform.

				<title>Simulation for memory effect of Fick’s first law</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0601-0605</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The memory effect of the Fick’s first law, expressed by $\tau(\partial J/\partial t$) = $–J$ – Dgradc, was confirmed by means of the 3D Monte Carlo simulation, where $\tau$ is the relaxation time, $J$ is the flux of the diffusing particles, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $c$ is the concentration of the particles. The delay has been observed by chronoamperometry at a pair electrode. It behaves as if it were due to a slow electron transfer reaction. A diffusion model was composed of two cubic cells with different volumes in contact with each other by their faces, which worked as the boundary for the flux. Each cell contained one diffusing particle and solvent molecules for a given concentration. The particle moved randomly in the 3D lattice until it traversed the boundary. The number of the random steps before the traverse was equivalent to the relaxation time. It was proportional to ca 2/3 powers of the number of solvent molecules or was inversely proportional to $0⋅63$ powers of the concentration. The relaxation time was roughly equivalent to the lapse of taking for the particle to visit every lattice site impartially.</p>

This equivalence is shown to be lost by the empirical equations of state in presence of an attractive nonideality. The modified forms are noted. We then construct a simple quantum mechanical model to simulate these results and obtain a one-to-one correspondence. We see how these equations of interest may be extended to $D$-dimensions. By employing the quantum model, we next observe the equivalence of the results found above with those obtained via statistical mechanics. As an added advantage, we demonstrate that the virial theorem for confined quantum stationary states retains its validity in the statistical domain too, though here the averaging scheme is correspondingly different.</p>

					<p>The spectrometric analysis of a mixture of two chemically and spectroscopically similar compounds is illustrated for the simultaneous spectrometric determination of caffeine and theobromine, the primary stimulants in coffee and tea, based on their ultraviolet absorbances. Their analysis indicates that such measurements may need an unexpectedly high precision to yield accurate answers, because of an artifact of inverse cancellation, in which a small noise or drift signal is misinterpreted in terms of a concentration difference. The computed sum of the concentrations is not affected.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0629-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lyotropic liquid crystalline phases formed by surfactants are of special importance due to their close resemblance to biological systems. The redox reactions in such ordered media are of fundamental interest in understanding several complex processes occurring in the biological media, where the former can act as model systems. In this work, we have carried out the redox reactions of benzoquinone| hydroquinone, methyl viologen and ferrocenemethanol probes in a lyotropic hexagonal columnar phase (H1 phase) using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies. The liquid crystalline phase we have studied is made up of the non-ionic surfactant, Triton X-100 and water. Polarizing optical microscopic examination confirmed that the columnar hexagonal phase is retained even after the addition of redox probe as well as the supporting electrolyte. Our studies show a significant shift in the half-peak potentials of the redox probes in the H1 phase as compared to the solvent phase. The diffusion coefficient values for different redox probes in the H1 phase were also found to be significantly reduced when compared to the corresponding solvent media.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>RuO$_2$ thin layers were deposited on Ti supports by thermal decomposition of RuCl$_3$ at 400$^\circ$C. Some of the samples were subjected to laser irradiation between $0⋅5$ and $1⋅5$ J cm$^{–2}$. Some others to Kr bombardment with doses between $10^{15}$ and $10^{16}$ cm$^{–2}$. Modifications introduced by the surface treatments were monitored by cyclic voltammetry and O$_2$ evolution in H$_2$SO$_4$ solution. The voltammetric charge increased with surface treatment almost to the same extent for irradiation and bombardment. The electrocatalytic activity turned out much higher for Kr bombarded samples. Raw experimental data were scrutinized in an attempt to separate geometric from electronic factors. True electrocatalytic effects are clearly seen to prevail over purely surface area effects.</p>

				<title>Poly (vinyl alcohol) hydrogel membrane as electrolyte for direct borohydride fuel cells</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0647-0654</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) employing a poly (vinyl alcohol) hydrogel membrane electrolyte (PHME) is reported. The DBFC employs an AB$_5$ Misch metal alloy as anode and a goldplated stainless steel mesh as cathode in conjunction with aqueous alkaline solution of sodium borohydride as fuel and aqueous acidified solution of hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. Room temperature performances of the PHME-based DBFC in respect of peak power outputs; $\textit{ex-situ}$ cross-over of oxidant, fuel, anolyte and catholyte across the membrane electrolytes; utilization efficiencies of fuel and oxidant, as also cell performance durability are compared with a similar DBFC employing a Nafion&#174;-117 membrane electrolyte (NME). Peak power densities of $\tilde$30 and $\tilde$40 mW cm$^{–2}$ are observed for the DBFCs with PHME and NME, respectively. The crossover of NaBH$_4$ across both the membranes has been found to be very low. The utilization efficiencies of NaBH$_4$ and H$_2$O$_2$ are found to be $\tilde$24 and $\tilde$59&#37;, respectively for the PHME-based DBFC; $\tilde$18 and $\tilde$62&#37;, respectively for the NME-based DBFC. The PHME and NME–based DBFCs exhibit operational cell potentials of $\tilde 1⋅2$ and $\tilde 1⋅4$ V, respectively at a load current density of 10 mA cm$^{–2}$ for $\tilde$100 h.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0655-0664</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New-generation Pt/C–TiO$_2$ nanocomposite electrocatalysts for fuel cells, prepared by a heterogeneous photocatalytic method, have been characterized using techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Importantly, galvanostatic data confirm the superior stability of these materials against corrosion under anodic polarization conditions relative to commercial benchmark fuel cell electrocatalysts. EIS spectra from ETEK 5, SIDCAT 405 and SIDCAT 410 membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were fit to a Randles equivalent circuit with a Warburg element to show the presence of O$_2$ transport limitation arising from the use of thicker electrodes (lower Pt loading on carbon). The use of a constant phase element (CPE) instead of pure capacitor was justified from the fit procedure as CPE represents the porous electrode system more precisely with its distributive elements. EIS spectra from Tanaka, SIDCAT 451 and SIDCAT 452 MEAs (thinner electrodes) were fit to a Randles circuit with a pure capacitor and no Warburg element. The use of a transmission line model for fitting these data independently provided information about the catalyst layer resistance while all other parameters matched well with that of the Randles circuit. The effective proton transport in cathodes was quantified using polarization data for both classes of MEAs. Trends in the previously reported performance of MEAs prepared using these electrocatalysts were justified based on the relative contributions of kinetic, Ohmic and mass transfer losses to the overall overpotential, which in turn were estimated from impedance and polarization data analyses.</p>

				<page>0675-0683</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrochemical reduction of hydrogen peroxide is studied on a sand-blasted stainless steel (SSS) electrode in an aqueous solution of NaClO$_4$. The cyclic voltammetric reduction of H$_2$O$_2$ at low concentrations is characterized by a cathodic peak at $–0⋅40$ V versus standard calomel electrode (SCE).Cyclic voltammetry is studied by varying the concentration of H$_2$O$_2$ in the range from $0⋅2$ mM to 20 mM and the sweep rate in the range from 2 to 100 mV s$^{–1}. Voltammograms at concentrations of H$_2$O$_2$ higher than 2 mM or at high sweep rates consist of an additional current peak, which may be due to the reduction of adsorbed species formed during the reduction of H$_2$O$_2$. Amperometric determination of H$_2$O$_2$ at $–0⋅50$ V vs SCE provides the detection limit of 5 $\mu$M H$_2$O$_2$. A plot of current density versus concentration has two segments suggesting a change in the mechanism of H$_2$O$_2$ reduction at concentrations of H$_2$O$_2 \geq$ 2 mM. From the rotating disc electrode study, diffusion co-efficient of H$_2$O$_2$ and rate constant for reduction of H$_2$O$_2$ are evaluated.</p>

Crystal growth is predominant along the $c$-crystallographic axis. The crystallites orient themselves with their $c$-axis normal to the substrate. The crystallites exhibit three-fold twinning (trilling) consequent to the evolution of the $\{110\}$ planes as planes of reflection.

					<p>The electrochemistry of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) prepared from 2-mercaptopyridine (2 Mpy) and 4-mercaptopyridine (4 Mpy) dissolved in either water or an aqueous solution of $0⋅1$ M H$_2$SO$_4$ on a polycrystalline gold electrode has been investigated in an aqueous electrolyte solution ($0⋅5$ M H$_2$SO$_4$) using cyclic voltammetry. Results suggest that 2 Mpy is adsorbed more strongly than 4 Mpy due to the formation of a S–Au–N chelate. The under- and over-potential deposition of copper from an aqueous solution of $0⋅1$ M sulphuric acid is inhibited in the presence of these SAMs suggesting strong interactions between these adsorbates and the gold surface. A copper adlayer was partially displaced by adsorbing 2 Mpy and 4 Mpy. The inhibition effect of these SAMs on the corrosion of C60 steel has been investigated using electrochemical impedance measurements (EIM) in an aqueous $3⋅5$ wt&#37; NaCl solution. The polarization resistance and the inhibition efficiency were calculated. 2 Mpy has higher inhibition efficiency than 4 Mpy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A co-planar electrode device, fabricated with all electrodes (working, counter and reference) on the same face of a Nafion&#174; polymer electrolyte membrane, is proposed for the amperometric detection of gaseous methanol using Pt as the working electrode. Clear voltammetry is obtained for methanol oxidation from its vapours in equilibrium with methanol aqueous solutions, both in the absence and presence of oxygen in the gas stream. Using an appropriate pulse sequence to keep the indicator electrode active, methanol vapours in the 1–13 Torr partial pressure range (in equilibrium with methanol aqueous solutions in the 1–10&#37; w/w concentration range) could be determined, in a constant potential, amperometric mode. The methanol detector could be operated both in a nitrogen stream and (in what is essential for practical applications) in an air atmosphere too, with estimated detection limits of $1⋅2$ and $1⋅4$ Torr respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The phenosafranine adsorbed onto the micro and mesoporous materials prepared by ion exchange method and interaction of the dye with host materials were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to elucidate the influence of the host matrix on the binding energy of N 1s orbital. Core level N 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the interaction between the dye and the solid surface through the hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen atoms of primary amino groups in dye molecule and the oxygen atom of surface hydroxyl groups. The strength of the hydrogen bonding depends on the nature of the solid surface. In the dye adsorbed onto the micro and mesoporous materials the interaction between adsorbed phenosafranine and the surfaces of the porous materials are found to modify the optical spectra and the excited state dynamics of the confined phenosafranine molecules. The change in photophysical properties of phenosafranine adsorbed on to the host materials on dehydration at elevated temperatures is attributed to the modification of host surface during dehydration process.</p>

				<title>Imaging hydrogen oxidation activity of catalyst-coated perfluoro sulfonic acid-polymer electrolyte membranes using Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0719-0725</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM) is a unique technique for studying fast heterogeneous kinetics and to map reactivity gradients along the surface of an electrocatalyst, especially when it involves multiple surface sites of varying reactivity. It combines the dual advantages offered by ultramicroelectrode (UME) voltammetry in terms of reduced ohmic drop and insignificant double layer charging contribution with the advantages of imaging by rastering the UME across an electro-active surface. In this work, we demonstrate these distinctive features of SECM in evaluating reactivity gradients on catalyst (Pt/C) coated Nafion&#174; films towards hydrogen oxidation activity, a reaction of immense technological relevance. Imaging has been performed in the feedback mode by allowing H$_2$ evolution at the tip (25 $\mu$m Pt UME), which is reoxidized at the substrate electrode containing Pt/C-Nafion film. Interesting distribution in H$_2$ oxidation activity has been observed as a function of potential applied to the Pt/CNafion film. In addition, a plot of normalized tip current versus the substrate electrode potential indicates the effect of potential-induced reactivity change in the catalyst-coated membranes. The results of the present investigation are believed to be useful to H$_2$/O$_2$ PEM fuel cells with respect to evaluating reactivity gradients of catalyst-coated polymer electrolyte membranes, which is important to rectify problems related to catalyst utilization.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polymer electrolytes are known to possess excellent physicochemical properties that are very useful for electrochemical energy systems. The mobility in polymer electrolytes is understood to be mainly due to the segmental motion of polymer chains and the ion transport is generally restricted to the amorphous phase of the polymer. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) that are formed using plastizicers and polymers along with ionic salts are known to exhibit liquid-like ionic conductivity while maintaining the dimensional stability of a solid matrix. In the present study, the preparation and characterization of poly(vinyl alcohol)-based hydrogel membranes (PHMEs) as electrolytes for electrochemical capacitors have been reported. Varying HClO$_4$ dopant concentration leads to different characteristics of the capacitors. The EC comprising PHME doped with 2 M HClO$_4$ and black pearl carbon (BPC) electrodes has been found to exhibit a maximum specific capacitance value of 97 F g$^{–1}$, a phase angle value of 78$^\circ$, and a maximum charge–discharge coulombic efficiency of 88&#37;.</p>

					<p>The electrocatalytic activity of core–shell Au$_{100–x}$Ag$_x$ ($x = 15$, 27, 46, and 60) bimetallic nanoparticles embedded in methyl functionalized silicate MTMOS network towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide was investigated by using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric techniques. Core–shell Au/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles were characterized by absorption spectra and HRTEM. The MTMOS silicate sol–gel embedded Au$_{73}$Ag$_{27}$ core–shell nanoparticles modified electrode showed better synergistic electrocatalytic effect towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide when compared to monometal MTMOS-Au$_{\text{nps}}$ and MTMOS-Ag$_{\text{nps}}$ modified electrodes. These modified electrodes were studied without immobilizing any enzyme in the MTMOS sol–gel matrix.

				<abstract>
					<p>Structure transitions between copper UPD adlayers on Au(111)–($1 \times  1$) in sulfuric acid and chloride containing electrolyte were investigated by in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy. We demonstrate that co-adsorbed sulphate ions in the ($\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$)R30$^\circ$ UPD adlayer are replaced by chloride ions and, depending on the halide coverage, a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) or a slightly distorted ($5 \times 5$)-like Cu–Cl UPD adlayer are formed. The stability ranges of these phases are controlled both by the electrode potential and the Cl$^–$ concentration. Phase transitions between the three UPD phases were monitored by time-resolved $\textit{in situ}$ STM. The observed structure details were attributed to mechanisms based on two-dimensional nucleation and growth processes.</p>

					<p>The dissociation of a diatomic molecule in low frequency polychromatic fields of moderate intensities is studied. Genetic Algorithm is invoked to search out a set of four optimal non-resonant frequencies ($\omega_1$ – $\omega_4$), intensities ($\epsilon_1$ – $\epsilon_4$) the and phase angles ($\delta_1 – \delta_4$), for achieving a facile photo dissociation. Time-dependent Hellmann–Feynman theorem is used to gain insight into the frequency resolved energy absorption pattern.

				<abstract>
					<p>Deviations from the usual $R^{–6}$ dependence of the rate of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) on the distance between the donor and the acceptor have been a common scenario in the recent times. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of the distance dependence of FRET, and try to illustrate the non-$R^{–6}$ type behaviour of the rate for the case of transfer from a localized electronic excitation on the donor, a dye molecule to three different energy acceptors with delocalized electronic excitations namely, graphene, a two-dimensional semiconducting sheet and the case of such a semiconducting sheet rolled to obtain a nanotube. We use simple analytic models to understand the distance dependence in each case.</p>

				<title>Nonadiabatic quantum wave packet dynamics of the H + H$_2$ reaction including the coriolis coupling</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0789-0795</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of coriolis coupling on the dynamics of H + H$_2$ reaction is examined by calculating the initial state-selected and energy resolved reaction probabilities on the coupled manifold of its degenerate $2p$ ($E'$) ground electronic state. H$_3$ in this state is prone to the Jahn–Teller (JT) instability and consequently the degeneracy is split upon distortion from its $D_{3h}$ equilibrium geometry. The orbital degeneracy is, however, restored along the $D_{3h}$ symmetry configuration and it results into conical intersections of the two JT split component states. The energetically lower adiabatic component of latter is repulsive, and mainly (`rather solely’) drive the H $+$ H$_2$ reaction dynamics. On the otherhand, the upper adiabatic component is of bound type and can only impart non-adiabaticity on the dynamics of lower state. Comparison calculations are therefore also carried out on the uncoupled lower adiabatic sheet to assess the nonadiabatic effect. Exact quantum scattering calculations are performed by a chebyshev polynomial propagator and employing the double many body expansion potential energy surface of the electronic ground state of H$_3$. Reaction probabilities are reported up to a total energy of $\tilde$ $3⋅0$ eV, slightly above the energetic minimum of the seam of conical intersections at $\tilde$ $2⋅74$ eV. Reaction probabilities are calculated up to the total angular momentum, $J = 20$ and for each value of $J$, the projection quantum number $K$ is varied from 0 to min ($J, K_{\text{max}}$), with $K_{\text{max}} = 4$. Probability results are compared and discussed with those obtained without the coriolis coupling.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum mechanical study of vibrational state-resolved differential cross sections and transition probabilities for both the elastic/inelastic and the charge transfer processes have been carried out in the H$^+$ $+$ O$_2$ collisions at the experimental collision energy of 23 eV. The quantum dynamics has been performed within the vibrational close-coupling rotational infinite-order sudden approximation framework employing our newly obtained quasi-diabatic potential energy surfaces corresponding to the ground and the first excited electronic states which have been computed using $\textit{ab initio}$ procedures and Dunning’s correlation consistent-polarized valence triple zeta basis set at the multireference configuration interaction level of accuracy. The present theoretical results for elastic/inelastic processes provide an overall agreement with the available state-selected experimental data, whereas the results for the charge transfer channel show some variance in comparison with those of experiments and are similar to the earlier theoretical results obtained using model effective potential based on projected valence bond method and using semi-empirical $\textit{diatomics-in-molecules}$ potential. The possible reason for discrepancies and the likely ways to improve the results are discussed in terms of the inclusion of higher excited electronic states into the dynamics calculation.</p>

					<p>The validity of an effective harmonic oscillator approximation for anharmonic molecular vibrations is tested and compared with vibrational self consistent field and vibrational configurational interaction results. The effective harmonic oscillator is constructed variationally, by taking the trial wave function as a harmonic oscillator eigenfunction with the centroid and width parameter as variational paraeters. It is found that the effective harmonic oscillator approximation provides a description of the anharmonic eigenstates very similar to the vibrational self consistent field results.

				<title>Computing magnetic anisotropy constants of single molecule magnets</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0823-0837</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here a theoretical approach to compute the molecular magnetic anisotropy parameters, $D_M$ and $E_M$ for single molecule magnets in any given spin eigenstate of exchange spin Hamiltonian. We first describe a hybrid constant $M_S$-valence bond (VB) technique of solving spin Hamiltonians employing full spatial and spin symmetry adaptation and we illustrate this technique by solving the exchange Hamiltonian of the Cu$_6$Fe$_8$ system. Treating the anisotropy Hamiltonian as perturbation, we compute the D$_M$ and E$_M$ values for various eigenstates of the exchange Hamiltonian. Since, the dipolar contribution to the magnetic anisotropy is negligibly small, we calculate the molecular anisotropy from the single-ion anisotropies of the metal centers. We have studied the variation of D$_M$ and E$_M$ by rotating the single-ion anisotropies in the case of Mn$_{12}$Ac and Fe$_8$ SMMs in ground and few low-lying excited states of the exchange Hamiltonian. In both the systems, we find that the molecular anisotropy changes drastically when the single-ion anisotropies are rotated. While in Mn$_{12}$Ac SMM $D_M$ values depend strongly on the spin of the eigenstate, it is almost independent of the spin of the eigenstate in Fe$_8$ SMM. We also find that the $D_M$ value is almost insensitive to the orientation of the anisotropy of the core Mn(IV) ions. The dependence of $D_M$ on the energy gap between the ground and the excited states in both the systems has also been studied by using different sets of exchange constants.</p>

					<p>The structure and stability of spiro-cyclic water clusters containing up to 32 water molecules have been investigated at different levels of theory. Although there exist minima lower in energy than these spiro-cyclic clusters, calculations at the Hartree–Fock level, density functional theory using B3LYP parametrization and second order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory using 6-31G$^\ast$ and 6-311$++$G$^{\ast\ast}$ basis sets show that they are stable in their own right. Vibrational frequency calculations and atoms-inmolecules analysis of the electron density map confirm the robustness of these hydrogen bonded clusters.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Several sandwich-like metal clusters have been studied at the B3LYP/6-311 $+$ G$^\ast$ level of theory. Bonding and reactivity have been analysed through various geometrical parameters and conceptual density functional theory based global reactivity descriptors. Aromaticity patterns have been understood in terms of the associated nucleus independent chemical shift values. Possibility of bond–stretch isomerism in some doped clusters is explored. Preferable sites for electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks have been identified using different local reactivity descriptors.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0859-0866</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrocyclic ring opening (ERO) reactions of 2-pyrone, 2-pyranol and pyran and their fluoro compounds (1–6) have been studied at MP2/6-31G($d$) level with special emphasis on the influence of fluorine on these pericyclic/pseudopericyclic processes. Calculations clearly predict that substitution of fluorine at C6 favour the reaction both kinetically and thermodynamically. Magnetic susceptibility anisotropy ($\Delta_{\chi\text{aniso}}$), NICS(0), NBO and bond critical property (BCP) analyses clearly illustrate the following; 2-pyrone (1) and 6-fluoro-2-pyrone (2) reactions are pseudopericyclic; 6-fluoro-2-pyranol (reaction 4) corresponds to a borderline case; 2-pyranol (3) and pyran (5) and 6-fluoro pyran (6) reactions are clearly pericyclic in character. Correspondingly pseudeopericyclic reactions show up orbital disconnections and fluorine delays the occurrence of orbital disconnections on the reaction trajectory.</p>

					<p>Results from different decouplings of the electron propagator theory using MP2/6-311$g$ ($2df$, $2p$) and MP2/6-311$++g$ ($2df$, $2p$) optimized geometries have been performed to investigate first eight vertical ionization energies and the corresponding Dyson orbitals.

				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated the structural aspects of several carbon dioxide molecular aggregates and their spectroscopic and nonlinear optical properties within the quantum chemical theory framework. We find that, although the single carbon dioxide molecule prefers to be in a linear geometry, the puckering of angles occur in oligomers because of the intermolecular interactions. The resulting dipole moments reflect in the electronic excitation spectra of the molecular assemblies. The observation of significant nonlinear optical properties suggests the potential application of the dense carbon dioxide phases in opto-electronic devices.</p>

				<title>Comparison between implicit and hybrid solvation methods for the determination of $pK_a$ of mono-protonated form of $13^2$-(demethoxycarbonyl) pheophytin $a$ in methanol</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0881-886</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Both implicit solvation method (dielectric polarizable continuum model, DPCM) and hybrid solvation method (cluster–continuum model) were adopted to calculate the $pK_a$ of mono-protonated form of $13^2$-(demethoxycarbonyl) pheophytin $a$ (Pheo) in methanol. In the cluster–continuum model calculations, we considered only 1 solvent molecule attached explicitly and others treated implicitly whereas in the DPCM calculations all the solvent molecules were treated implicitly. DPCM calculations were carried out on Pheo, PheoH+, Pheo-CH$_3$OH and PheoH$^+$-CH$_3$OH in methanol solution. The aim of these calculations was to determine the free energy changes involved in the deprotonation of PheoH$^+$ ($\Delta G_{\text{sol}}$) and finally to obtain the corresponding $pK_a$ value. DPCM calculations were carried out employing the restricted open-shell density functional treatment (ROB3LYP) using the 6-31G($d$) basis set to determine the free energy of solvation of bare Pheo and PheoH+ and of the clusters, Pheo-CH$_3$OH and PheoH$^+$-CH$_3$OH in methanol. $\textit{In-vacuo}$ geometries of all the species were obtained by performing optimizations at ROB3LYP level using the 6-31G($d$) basis. Electronic energies of all the species were then obtained by carrying out single point DFT calculations using 6-311$+$G($2d$, $2p$) basis set on the respective optimized geometries. Differences in thermal energy and molecular entropy were calculated by carrying out frequency calculations at ROB3LYP/STO-3G level on the optimized geometries of the truncated models. The optimized geometries of the clusters display intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. The $pK_a$ values of PheoH$^+$ calculated by DFT–DPCM and cluster–continuum methods are $6⋅12$ and $4⋅70$ respectively while the observed value is $4⋅14$. The hydrogen bonding interaction between the solute and the solvent can be attributed for the good performance of the cluster–continuum model over pure continuum model.</p>

				<title>Statistical theory of neutral protein evolution by random site mutations</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0887-0896</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Understanding the features of the protein conformational space represents a key component to characterize protein structural evolution at the molecular level. This problem is approached in a twofold manner; simple lattice models are used to represent protein structures with the ability of a protein sequence to fold into the lowest energy native conformation, quantified as the foldability, which measures the fitness of the sequence. Alternatively, a self-consistent mean-field based theory is developed to evaluate the protein neutrality through random single-point and multiple-point mutations by calculating the pair-wise probability profile of the amino acid residues in a library of sequences, consistent with a particular foldability criterion. The theory predicts the change in sequence plasticity with the foldability criterion and also correlates the effect of hydrophobic residues on the variation of the free energy surface of the protein as a function of the number of cumulative mutations. The results obtained from the theory are compared with the exact enumeration results of $3 \times 3 \times 3$ lattice protein and also with some small real proteins chosen from the protein databank. An excellent match of the results obtained from theory and exact enumeration with those of real proteins validates the range of applicability of the theory. The theory may provide a new perspective in $\textit{de novo}$ protein design, $\textit{in-vivo/in-vitro}$ protein evolution and site-directed mutagenesis experiments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We propose a simple approach to derive an exact analytical expression of work distribution for a system consisting of a colloidal particle trapped in an optical harmonic potential well, which is being pulled at a constant velocity through a solution represented by a non-Markovian bath. The thermal environment is represented by a bath composed of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators, and a model Hamiltonian for the trapped colloidal particle is constructed by representing the interaction with the bathvia linear dissipative mechanism. We have studied the effects of pulling time, pulling speed, and the adiabatic limit. It is also observed that only at long time the total work is completely converted into dissipative work.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of collective transport properties of ionic melts from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0913-0919</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics simulations of beryllium fluoride (BeF$_2$) have been carried out in the canonical (NVT) ensemble using a rigid-ion potential model. The Green–Kubo formalism has been applied to compute viscosities and ionic conductivities of BeF$_2$ melt. The computational parameters critical for reliably estimating these collective transport properties are shown to differ significantly for viscosity and ionic conductivity. In addition to the equilibrium values of these transport properties, structural relaxation times as well as high-frequency IR-active modes are computed from the pressure and charge-flux auto correlation functions (ACFs) respectively. It is shown that a network-forming ionic melt, such as BeF$_2$, will display persistent oscillatory behaviour of the integral of the charge-flux ACF. By suitable Fourier transformation, one can show that these persistent oscillations correspond to highfrequency, infra-red active vibrations associated with local modes of the network.</p>

				<title>A comparative molecular dynamics study of diffusion of $n$-decane and 3-methyl pentane in Y zeolite</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Theoretical Chemistry and Electrochemistry</feature>
				<page>0921-0927</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics simulations are reported on the structure and dynamics of $n$-decane and 3-methylpentane in zeolite NaY. We have calculated several properties such as the center of mass-center of mass rdf, the end-end distance distribution, bond angle distribution and dihedral angle distribution. We have also analysed trajectory to obtain diffusivity and velocity autocorrelation function (VACF). Surprisingly, the diffusivity of 3-methylpentane which is having larger cross-section perpendicular to the long molecular axis is higher than $n$-decane at 300 K. Activation energies have been obtained from simulations performed at 200 K, 300 K, 350 K, 400 K and 450 K in the NVE ensemble. These results can be understood in terms of the previously known levitation effect. Arrhenious plot has higher value of slope for $n$-decane (5⋅9 kJ/mol) than 3-methylpentane (3⋅7 kJ/mol) in agreement with the prediction of levitation effect.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>For obtaining microscopic structural information in binary mixtures, often partial pair correlation functions are used. In the present study, a general approach is presented for obtaining the neighbourhood structural information for binary mixtures in terms of nth nearest neighbour distribution (NND) functions (for $n = 1, 2, 3,\ldots$). These functions are derived from the partial pair correlation functions in a hierarchical manner, based on the approach adopted earlier by us for single component fluids. Comparison of the results with MD simulation for Lennard–Jones binary mixtures is also presented. NND functions show reasonable matching for smaller n values particularly at higher density. The average $n$th nearest neighbour distance shows interesting feature.</p>

By analysing both we arrive at an algorithm that closely approximates the most accurate answer obtainable by this method, typically with at least 9 accurate decimals, while preserving a minimal footprint.

				<abstract>
					<p>We describe here a simple modification of the HN(C)N experiment for the generation of serine/threonine check points in the three-dimensional experiment. The various `triplet of residue’ specific peak patterns in the spectra are documented for ease of analysis and sequential backbone resonance assignment. The performance of this experiment, referred to as HN(C)N–ST, is demonstrated using two proteins, one properly folded and the other completely denatured. It is noteworthy that, even in the denatured protein, where spectral dispersions are rather poor, about 90&#37; of the sequential connectivities through the chain could be established from this single experiment. This would have great implications for structural genomics efforts.</p>

				<title>Coulomb explosion of methyl iodide clusters using giga watt laser pulses in the visible region: Effect of wavelength, polarisation and doping</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0965-0972</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nanosecond laser-induced Coulomb explosion studies have been carried out for methyl iodide clusters at 532 and 563 nm under similar laser intensity ($\tilde 5  \times 10^9$ W/cm$^2$) conditions. Multiply charged atomic ions of carbon and iodine having large kinetic energy ($\tilde~ 100$ s of eV) were observed in both the cases. Observation of higher charged states at 563 nm for Coulomb exploded atomic ions supports the preposition of enhanced inverse bremsstrahlung heating of the ionized cluster system at this wavelength. The angular distribution of the multiply charged atomic ions is found to be isotropic with respect to laser polarization direction at 532 nm. When water doped methyl iodide clusters were irradiated at 563 nm, highly charged atomic ions of oxygen along with carbon and iodine were also observed. This result suggests that the mechanism leading to Coulomb explosion is a collective property of the cluster as a whole and individual molecular properties do not play significant role.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Crystal structures of five imidazolin-5-ones are discussed. While molecules ${\bf 1–3}$ show a donor–acceptor type of $\pi \cdots \pi$ lateral offset stacking, C–H$\cdots \pi$ interactions are found to play dominant roles in molecules ${\bf 2}$ and ${\bf 4}$. In molecule 2, C-H$\cdots \pi$ interactions further form lateral offset stack to form extended C–H$\cdots \pi \cdots \pi \cdots$H–C hydrogen bonds. Molecule ${\bf 4}$, however shows a layer structure with interlayer C–H$\cdots \pi \cdots $H–C hydrogen bonds and interlayer stacking of imidazolin-5-one heterocycles. These structures show how weak $\pi \cdots \pi$ interactions can be exploited for tailoring supramolecular assemblies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Salicyclaldimines (${\bf 5–9}$) and naphthaldimines (${\bf 10–13}$) derived from condensation reactions of N$_2$O$_2$ donor type bifunctional aminopodands (${\bf 1–4}$), [(H$_2$NPhO)$_2$R, where R = CH$_2$CH$_2$, CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$ and CH$_2$PhCH$_2$], and hydrazine monohydrate with salicylaldehyde and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, respectively, have been prepared (scheme 1) and characterized by elemental analyses, UV-vis, FTIR, NMR and MS. NMR assignments were made using ${}^1$H, ${}^{13}$C NMR, DEPT and aided by 2D HETCOR and HMBC heteronuclear correlation techniques. The UV-vis spectra of the Schiff bases have been systematically studied in organic solvents of different polarity, acidic and basic media and found useful in understanding of tautomeric equilibria (phenol-imine, O–H$\ldots$N and keto-amine, O$\ldots$H–N forms) in this series. The molecular structure of ${\bf 8}$ has been determined crystallographically, and observed that the compound is in the form of phenol-imine, defined by the strong intramolecular [O–H$\ldots$N = $1 \cdots 72$(3), $1 \cdots 81$(2) &#197;] hydrogen bonds. Compound ${\bf 8}$ crystallizes in the monoclinic space group $P2_1/a$ with $a = 8 \cdots 4675$(7), $b = 38 \cdots 448$(3), $c = 9 \cdots 3875$(7) &#197;, $\beta = 103 \cdots 0780$(10)$^\circ$, $V = 2976 \cdots 9$(4) &#197;$^3$, $Z = 4$ and $D_x = 1 \cdots 271$ Mg m$^{–3}$, and contains acetonitrile molecule in the crystal lattice.</p>

				<page>1011-1015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>$\alpha$-Chloroketones find numerous synthetic uses. We have developed a simple method of preparation of these compounds starting from alkenes adopting the $\textit{Green Chemistry}$ principle of solventfree reaction. The procedure involves addition of NOCl generated $\textit{in situ}$ by the reaction of AcOH–HCl (3 : 1) with amyl nitrite to alkenes and treating the $\alpha$-chloronitroso compounds obtained as dimers with levulinic acid in presence of a few drops of 6N HCl, the latter being a three-step domino reaction, in which the first is dissociation of dimer to monomer, the second is tautomerisation of the nitroso function to oxime followed by deoximation in the third step. The yields are excellent. Since the starting compounds are readily available alkenes and the reaction is carried out under mild conditions leading to excellent yields of highly useful $\alpha$-chloroketones, the procedure has the potential of wide application.</p>

					<p>The present study describes the photochemical degradation of phenol-red using photo–Fenton reaction. The progress of the reaction has been monitored spectrophotometrically. The effect of various organic additives e.g. hydroquinone, resorcinol and catechol on the rate of photodegradation has been observed. The effect of variation of various parameters such as pH, concentration of dye, Fe$^{3+}$ ion and additives, amount of H$_2$O$_2$, and light intensity on the rate of photodegradation was also observed. A tentative mechanism of the reaction has been proposed.</p>

					<p>The crystal structures of two thiacalixarene derivatives anchoring thiadiazole functional groups at lower rim, C$_{60}$H$_{72}$O$_4$S$_{12}$N$_{8}$ (${\bf 1}$), C$_{64}$H$_{80}$O$_{4}$S$_{12}$N$_8$ (${\bf 2}$), have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The thiacalix[4]arene framework in both ${\bf 1}$ and ${\bf 2}$ adopts the 1,3-alternate conformation. Compound ${\bf 1}$ forms a 1-D chain by weak hydrogen bonding (C–H$\cdots$N) interactions between two thiadiazole groups in two different molecules. The chains are further connected to form a 2-D network through sulfur–sulfur (S$\cdots$S) interactions. The lattice water molecules which exist as dimers by forming hydrogen bonds (O–H$\cdots$O) promote a 3-D supramolecular structure through weak hydrogen bonding (O–H$\cdots$S) interactions between the lattice water dimers and the 2-D networks. On the other hand, compound ${\bf 2}$, based on dimer which is formed by weak hydrogen bonding (C–H$\cdots$S) interactions, is extended to a 1-D chain through sulfur–sulfur (S$\cdots$S) interactions. The dimers of lattice methanol molecules linked by hydrogen bonds (O–H$\cdots$O) act as bridges to link the 1-D chains into a 2-D network through weak hydrogen bonding (C–H$\cdots$N) interactions.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1053-1060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics and equilibria for the axial ligation of pyridine and substituted pyridines to bromomethyl(aqua)cobaloxime have been measured spectrophotometrically in aqueous solutions of ionic strength $1 \cdot 0$ M (KC1) at 25$^\circ$C as a function of $p$H. The binding constants and rate of formation increase in the order 4-NH$_2$Py $ 4-EtPy $&gt;$ 4-MePy $&gt;$ Py $&gt;$ 2-NH$_2$Py $&gt;$ 2-EtPy. The data have been interpreted based on the basicity of the ligand, $\pi$-back bonding from Co(III) $\to$ L and hard and soft interactions. The rate of substitution of H$_2$O varies with the pKa of the incoming ligand, thus establishing the existence of nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. We have investigated the DNA binding of bromomethyl(aqua)cobaloxime with DNA. Bromomethyl(ligand)cobaloximes were isolated and characterized by elemental analysis, IR and NMR (${}^1$H, ${}^{13}$C) spectra.</p>

				<title>Preparation and adsorption property of aminated cross linking microbeads of GMA/EGDMA for bilirubin</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1061-1068</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cross linking microbeads with a controllable diameter were synthesized by suspension copolymerization of the monomer glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and the cross linking agent ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate (EGDMA). By the ring-opening reaction of the epoxy groups, the microbeads GMA/EGDMA were modified with different aminating agents and resulting in the aminated microbeads. The morphology of the microbeads was characterized by SEM. The adsorption property of aminated microbeads for bilirubin was investigated, and the effects of various factors, such as the chemical structures of the aminating agents, pH values of the medium and the presence of bovine serum albumin in the adsorption medium, on the adsorption property were examined. The experimental results show that the aminated microbeads have strong adsorption ability for bilirubin, and the isotherm adsorption behaviour is fitted to Freundlich equation satisfactorily. The adsorption ability of the aminated microbeads modified with hexanediamine is stronger than that of others, and the longer the molecule of multi-ethylene multiamine, the weaker the adsorption ability for bilirubin. The pH value of the medium affects the adsorption ability greatly, as pH = 6, the adsorption ability is strongest. In the presence of BSA, the microbeads still have a higher adsorption capacity towards bilirubin.</p>

				<title>Disposable amperometric immunosensor based on layer-by-layer electro-depositing of the nanogold particles, prussian blue-modified indium tin oxide for determination of $\alpha$-fetoprotein</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1069-1076</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a novel disposable immunosensor for the detection of $\alpha$-fetoprotein (AFP) based on the Indium tin oxide (ITO) modified by the sequential electro-deposition of the nanogold particles (nano-Au) and prussian blue (PB) is described. The ITO is employed to reduce the cost, instead of expensive gold electrode, glassy carbon electrode or platinum electrode. The layer-by-layer (LBL) electro-deposition of the nano-Au, PB is used for blocking the possible leakage from the substrate electrode surface and to prevent shedding of composite membrane. Under optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor displays a broad linear response to AFP, the working range being $0 \cdot 25$ to $300 \cdot 0$ ng mL$^{–1}$ with a detection limit of $0 \cdot 04$ ng mL$^{–1}$. The studied immunosensor exhibits high sensitivity, fast analytical time and good stability. The proposed methodology is potentially attractive for clinical immunoassays.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chrysalis-like morphologies of CuO have been synthesized in large-quantity via a simple chemical deposition method without the use of any complex instruments and reagents. CuO nanocrystals showed a different morphology at three different temperatures, 25, 60 and 100$^\circ$C. The particle size, morphology and crystal structure of the samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra. The catalytic effect of CuO nanoparticles on the decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) was investigated by STA 409 PC thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10$^\circ$C min$^{–1}$ from 35 to 500$^\circ$C. Compared with the thermal decomposition of pure AP, the addition of CuO nanoparticles decreased the decomposition temperature of AP by about 85$^\circ$C.</p>

				<title>Voltammetric sensor for D-penicillamine determination based on its electrocatalytic oxidation at the surface of ferrocenes modified carbon paste electrodes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1083-1091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrocatalytic oxidation of D-penicillamine (D-PA) at the surface of ferrocene modified carbon paste electrode (FCCPE) was thoroughly investigated in aqueous solution with various pH. The performance of this modified electrode was compared with those of 2,7-$bis$(ferrocenyl ethyl) fluoren-9-one modified carbon paste electrode (2,7-BFEFMCPE). In the optimum condition, the oxidation of D-PA at the surface of FCCPE and 2,7-BFEFMCPE is occurred about 480 and 320 mV less positive than that unmodified carbon paste electrode, respectively. The linear dynamic ranges $6  \times  10^{–5}$ M$^{–2}  \times 10^{–3}$ M, $6 \cdot 5  \times  10^{–5}$ M–$1 \cdot 1 \times  10^{–3}$ M and $7\times 10^{–6}$ M–$1 \cdot 6 \times 10^{–4}$M, $7 \times  10^{–6}$ M–$2 \times  10^{–4}$ M of D-PA are obtained from CV and DPV methods for FCCPE and 2,7-BFEFMCPE, respectively. The detection limits (3$\sigma$) were determined as $5 \cdot 4 \times  10^{–5}$ M and $6 \cdot 3 \times  10^{–5}$ M in CV and $6 \cdot 2 \times 10^{–6}$ M and $6 \cdot 8 \times 10^{–6}$ M in DPV determinations for FCCPE and 2,7-BFEFMCPE, respectively. The proposed method was applied in a highly sensitive determination of D-PA in drug and human synthetic serum samples by standard addition and recovery methods, respectively.</p>

				<title>Multidimensional potential of boron-containing molecules in functional materials</title>
				<feature>2nd International Symposium on Materials Chemistry (ISMC-2008)</feature>
				<page>0007-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Boron-containing molecular systems have received much attention under theoretical aspects and from the side of synthetic organic chemistry. However, their potential for further applications such as optically interesting effects such as Non-Linear Optics (NLO), medical uses for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), or magnetism has been recognised only fairly recently. Molecular systems containing boron offer particular mechanisms to accommodate unpaired electrons which may result in stable radicals as spin-bearing materials. Among such materials are organoboron compounds in which the prototypical electron deficient (${}^{10}$B, ${}^{11}$B) boron vs. carbon centers can accept and help to delocalise added electrons in a 2-dimensionally conjugated $\pi$ system. Alternatively, oligoboron clusters B$_n$X$_n^k$ and the related carboranes or metallacarboranes are capable of adding or losing single electrons to form paramagnetic clusters with 3-dimensionally delocalised spin, according to combined experimental studies and quantum chemical calculations. The unique nuclear properties of ${}^{10}$B are of therapeutic value if their selective transport via appended carbon nanotubes, boron nanotubes, or magnetic nanoparticles can be effected.</p>

				<title>Magnetic behaviour in metal–organic frameworks — Some recent examples</title>
				<feature>2nd International Symposium on Materials Chemistry (ISMC-2008)</feature>
				<page>0019-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The article describes the synthesis, structure and magnetic investigations of a series of metal–organic framework compounds formed with Mn$^{+2}$ and Ni$^{+2}$ ions. The structures, determined using the single crystal X-ray diffraction, indicated that the structures possess two- and three-dimensional structures with magnetically active dimers, tetramers, chains, two-dimensional layers connected by polycarboxylic acids. These compounds provide good examples for the investigations of magnetic behaviour. Magnetic studies have been carried out using SQUID magnetometer in the range of 2–300 K and the behaviour indicates a predominant anti-ferromagnetic interactions, which appears to differ based on the M–O–C–O–M and/or the M–O–M (M = metal ions) linkages. Thus, compounds with carboxylate (Mn– O–C–O–Mn) connected ones, [C$_3$N$_2$H$_5$][Mn(H$_2$O)$\{$C$_6$H$_3$(COO)$_3\}$], ${\bf I}$, [$\{$Mn(H$_2$O)$_3\}\{$C$_{12}$H$_8$O(COO)$_2\}$]$\cdots$H$_2$O, ${\bf II}$, [$\{$Mn(H$_2$O)$\}\{$C$_{12}$H$_8$O(COO)$_2\}$], ${\bf III}$, show simple anti-ferromagnetic behaviour. The compounds with Mn–O/OH–Mn connected dimer and tetramer units in [NaMn$\{$C$_6$H$_3$(COO)$_3\}$], ${\bf IV}$, [Mn$_2$($\mu_3$-OH) (H$_2$O)$_2\{$C$_6$H$_3$(COO)$_3\}$]$\cdot$2H$_2$O, ${\bf V}$, show canted-antiferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic behaviour, respectively. The presence of infinite one-dimensional –Ni–OH–Ni– chains in the compound, [NiR_2R(HR_2RO)($\mu_3$-OH)$_2$(C$_8$H$_5$NO$_4$], ${\bf VI}$, gives rise to ferromagnet-like behaviour at low temperatures. The compounds, [Mn$_3\{$C$_6$H$_3$(COO)$_3\}_2$], $\{\bf VII}$ and [$\{$Mn(OH)\}_2\{$C$_{12}$H$_8$O(COO)$_2\}$], ${\bf VIII}$, have two-dimensional infinite –Mn–O/OH–Mn– layers with triangular magnetic lattices, which resemble the Kagome and brucite-like layer. The magnetic studies indicated canted-antiferromagnetic behaviour in both the cases. Variable temperature EPR and theoretical magnetic modelling studies have been carried out on selected compounds to probe the nature of the magnetic species and their interactions with them.</p>

				<title>Superconductivity at $31\cdot 3$ K in Yb-doped La(O/F)FeAs superconductors</title>
				<feature>2nd International Symposium on Materials Chemistry (ISMC-2008)</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of ytterbium substitution at the lanthanum site on the superconducting properties of La$_{1–x}$Yb$_x$O$_{0\cdot 8}$F$_{0 \cdot 2}$FeAs ($x = 0\cdot 10$, $0\cdot 20$ and $0 \cdot 30$) oxypnictides has been investigated. Powder X-ray diffraction studies show the presence of Yb$_2$O$_3$ and LaOF as secondary phases. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of $31 \cdot 3$ ($\pm \, 0 \cdot 05$) K has been observed in $x = 0\cdot 1$ composition which is the maximum $T_c$ so far in the La(O/F)FeAs superconductor family at ambient pressure. Further increase in $x$ leads to suppression and broadening of superconducting transition. The resistive transition curves under different magnetic fields were investigated, leading to determination of upper critical field $H_{c2}$ ($T$) of this new superconductor. The value of $H_{c2}$ at zero temperature is estimated to be about 46 T corresponding to coherence length $\tilde 27$ &#197;.</p>

				<title>Molecular tailoring approach for exploring structures, energetics and properties of clusters</title>
				<feature>2nd International Symposium on Materials Chemistry (ISMC-2008)</feature>
				<page>0047-0056</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular Tailoring Approach (MTA) is a method developed for enabling $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations on prohibitively large molecules or atomic/molecular clusters. A brief review of MTA, a linear scaling technique based on set inclusion and exclusion principle, is provided. The Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MESP) of smaller clusters is exploited for building initial geometries for the larger ones, followed by MTA geometry optimization. The applications of MTA are illustrated with a few test cases such as (CO$_2$)$_n$ and Li$_n$ clusters employing Density Functional theory (DFT) and a nanocluster of orthoboric acid at the Hartree–Fock (HF) level. Further, a discussion on the geometries and energetics of benzene tetramers and pentamers, treated at the Møller–Plesset second order (MP2) perturbation theory, is given. MTA model is employed for evaluating some cluster properties viz. adiabatic ionization potential, MESP, polarizability, Hessian matrix and infrared frequencies. These property evaluations are carried out on a series of test cases and are seen to offer quite good agreement with those computed by an actual calculation. These case studies highlight the advantages of MTA model calculations vis-à-vis the actual ones with reference to the CPU-time, memory requirements and accuracy.</p>

				<title>Development of gas sensors using ZnO nanostructures</title>
				<feature>2nd International Symposium on Materials Chemistry (ISMC-2008)</feature>
				<page>0057-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Different ZnO nanostructures such as nanowires, nanobelts and tetrapods have been grown and used for preparation of thick film (with random grain boundaries) as well as isolated nanowire/nanobelt gas sensors. Sensitivity of different type of sensors has been studied to H$_2$S and NO gases. The results show that the response of ZnO sensors to H$_2$S arises from grain boundary only whereas both grain boundaries and intragrain resistances contribute towards response to NO. In addition, oxygen vacancies in the lattice were also seen to help in improvement of sensor response. Room temperature operating H$_2$S and NO sensors based on ZnO nanowires have been demonstrated. Further, sensors based on isolated nanobelts were found to be highly selective in their response to NO.</p>

				<feature>2nd International Symposium on Materials Chemistry (ISMC-2008)</feature>
				<page>0071-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microwave-assisted procedure for low temperature solid state synthesis of sodium zirconium phosphate (NZP), a material with the potential for immobilization and disposal of high level nuclear waste, was developed. Three selected fission products, namely, Cesium, Strontium and Tellurium were introduced (substituted) in the NZP matrix during its synthesis at 450$^\circ$C. Leaching studies were carried out on the fission product substituted NZP sintered at 1000$^\circ$C, in pure de-ionized water and 80&#37; saturated brine solution at the ambient temperatures of 30$^\circ$C and 90$^\circ$C for four weeks. The major part of leaching in all the cases was observed in the first week. The extent of leaching after four weeks was found not exceeded from 12 to 15&#37; of the elements substituted in NZP, which later became negligibly small. The effect of temperature and the nature of leachant on the leaching rate did not indicate any systematic trend. The EDX analysis of the surfaces of the leached NZP pellets showed that the leaching of the dopants is limited mainly to the surface region of the sintered pellets.</p>

				<feature>2nd International Symposium on Materials Chemistry (ISMC-2008)</feature>
				<page>0083-0089</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A brief review of the issues involved in modelling of the solid state transformation kinetics is presented. The fact that apart from the standard thermodynamic parameters, certain path variables like heating or cooling rate can also exert a crucial influence on the kinetic outcome is stressed. The kinetic specialties that are intrinsic to phase changes proceeding under varying thermal history are enumerated. A simple and general modelling methodology for understanding the kinetics of non-isothermal transformations is outlined.</p>

				<title>Ternary mixtures of alkyltriphenylphosphonium bromides (C$_{12}$TPB, C$_{14}$TPB and C$_{16}$TPB) in aqueous medium: their interfacial, bulk and fluorescence quenching behaviour</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0109-0117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The self-aggregation behaviour of ternary mixtures of alkyl (C$_{12}^-$, C$_{14}^-$ and C$_{16}^-$) triphenylphosphonium bromides was studied by conductometry and tensiometry. The pure surfactants showed two Critical Micellar Concentrations (CMCs) by conductometry, but their ternary mixtures produce single CMC both by conductometry and tensiometry. The CMC values determined were found to be lower than that obtained from Clint equation suggesting synergistic interaction among the monomers within the micelles. Their bulk properties, like fraction of counterions bound to the micelles and free energy of micellization were evaluated. Interfacial parameters, like surface excess, minimum head group area of monomer and free energy of adsorption were also assessed. Interfacial adsorption was found to be more spontaneous than micellization. The head group area per monomer in ternary systems was larger than pure systems due to stronger electrostatic repulsion among the charged head groups. The values of the packing parameters supported the pure as well as ternary micelles to be spherical. The TPB surfactants efficiently quenched pyrene fluorescence; the performances of the homologues in this respect were assessed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series of 2,8-$p$-diaryldibenzothiophene derivatives were synthesized and characterized. These molecules have electron withdrawing or electron donating groups at the $\\textit{para}$ phenyl position, which alters the electronic properties of these derivatives. The quantum yield, fluorescence lifetime, singlet, triplet and E$_{|text{HOMO}}$ energy levels of these compounds were determined by fluorescence, phosphorescence and cyclic voltammetry. A plot of Hammett constants of the $\textit{para}$ substituents vs E$_{\text{HOMO}}$ revealed a linear relationship. The usefulness of these molecules in organic light emitting diodes, OLEDs is discussed vis-à-vis the energy levels and properties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A one pot reaction involving $\textit{sym  } N,N'$-diarylthiourea and the respective arylamine in the presence of aq. KOH in nitrobenzene at $\geq 105^\circ$C afforded sym $N,N',N"$-triarylguanidine in fair to good yield and the products have been characterized. $\textit{Sym }N,N',N"$-tri(4-tolyl)guanidine possesses (${\bf 7}$) $\textit{anti–anti}$ conformation, $\textit{sym }N,N',N"$-tri(2-tolyl)guanidine (${\bf 8}$) and $\textit{sym }N,N',N"$-tris(2,4-xylyl)guanidine (${\bf 11}$) each possess $\textit{anti–anti}$ $\alpha \beta \alpha$ conformation whereas $\textit{sym  }N,N',N"$-tris(2-anisyl)guanidine possesses (${\bf 9}$) $\textit{syn–anti}$ $\alpha \beta \beta$ conformation as determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction data. The observed conformations appear to result from a subtle balance between steric factor associated with the aryl substituent and multiple electronic factors namely $n–\pi$ conjugation/negative hyperconjugation and non-covalent interactions in the crystal lattice.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A novel series of fifteen 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2($1H$)-yl)-$N$-(substituted phenyl) propanamides ${\bf 3(a–o)}$ were synthesized by reacting the corresponding 3-chloro-$N$-(aryl) propanamides ${\bf 2(a–o)}$ with 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline ${\bf 1}$ in acetonitrile. The compounds have been characterized on the basis of elemental analysis and spectral data. All the compounds were evaluated for their HIV-1 RT inhibitory activity. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2($1H$)-yl)-$N$-$o$-tolyl propanamide ${\bf 3d}$ and 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2($1$H)-yl)-$N$-(2,4,6-tribromophenyl)propanamide ${\bf 3f}$ were identified as significant inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with 56&#37; and 43&#37; residual RT activity respectively at the final concentration of 40 $\mu$M when compared with the standard drug Efavirenz. Docking studies with HIV-1 RT (PDB ID 1rt2) were also performed in order to investigate the binding pattern of these compounds.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0193-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The transesterification of methyl salicylate with phenol has been studied in vapour phase over solid acid catalysts such as ZrO$_2$, MoO$_3$ and SO$^{2–}_4$ or Mo(VI) ions modified zirconia. The catalytic materials were prepared and characterized for their total surface acidity, BET surface area and powder XRD patterns. The effect of mole-ratio of the reactants, catalyst bed temperature, catalyst weight, flowrate of reactants, WHSV and time-on-stream on the conversion (&#37;) of phenol and selectivity (&#37;) of salol has been investigated. A good yield (up to 70&#37;) of salol with 90&#37; selectivity was observed when the reactions were carried out at a catalyst bed temperature of 200$^{\circ}$C and flow-rate of 10 mL/h in presence of Mo(VI)/ZrO$_2$ as catalyst. The results have been interpreted based on the variation of acidic properties and powder XRD phases of zirconia on incorporation of SO$^{2-}_4$ or Mo(VI) ions. The effect of poisoning of acid sites of SO$^{2–}_4$ or Mo(VI) ions modified zirconia on total surface acidity, powder XRD phases and catalytic activity was also studied. Possible reaction mechanisms for the formation of salol and diphenyl ether over acid sites are proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>3-Methoxy-4-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (MBBA) resin was synthesized by a two-step sequence under microwave irradiation involving the reaction of commercially available Merrifield resin with vanillin, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride. MBBA resin was treated with bromides in the presence of sodium hydride to afford the corresponding resin-bound benzyl ethers. Cleavage of the resin-bound benzyl ethers from the MBBA resin was carried out using 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoqunone (DDQ) to give the corresponding alcohols in good yields. Moreover, the recovery, regeneration, and reuse of this polymer support could be achieved easily. MBBA resin can be developed as a kind of solid-phase synthesis bead of alcohols.</p>

				<title>Controlled release of 5-flurouracil from biomedical polyurethanes</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0209-0216</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Novel biodegradable aliphatic poly(ether-urethane)s (PEUs) based on pluronic F-68 (PLF68) and castor oil were synthesized by the solution polymerization technique. These polymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic spectroscopy ($^1$HNMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to confirm the PEU formation and the molecular weight. Moderate molecular weight PEUs were obtained and converted into microspheres by solvent evaporation method to study the controlled release (CR) characteristics for 5-flurouracil (5-FU). PLF-68 acts as amphiphilic filler, which enhances the release of a hydrophobic drug such as 5-FU. Sizes of the microspheres as measured by laser light scattering technique ranged between 15 and 42 $\mu$m. An increase in the size of particles was observed with increasing molar ratio of PLF-68 with respect to castor oil. The percentage encapsulation efficiency varied between 71 and 98. Surface morphology of the microspheres as studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the spherical nature of the particles with wrinkles on their surfaces. The release of 5-FU through the microspheres was investigated in pH $7\cdot 4$-phosphate buffer. An increase in release rate was observed with increasing molar ratio of PLF68 with respect to castor oil.</p>

				<title>A new chromogenic agent for iron(III): Synthesis, structure and spectroscopic studies</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0217-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A heterocyclic hydrazone ligand, diacetyl monoxime-2-pyridyl hydrazone, HL, ${\bf 1}$, was investigated as a new chromogenic agent for selective detection of Fe$^{3+}$. The ligand ${\bf 1}$, undergoes 1 : 2 complexation with Fe$^{3+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ to form complexes [Fe$^{\text{III}}$(HL)$_2$]Cl$_3$, ${\bf 1a}$ and [Ni$^{\text{II}}$(HL)$_2$]Cl$_2$, ${\bf 1b}$ respectively. The iron(III) complex ${\bf 1a}$ gives a characteristic absorption peak at 487 nm with distinct reddish-pink colouration. The change in colour can easily be distinguished from other metal complexes by the naked eye. No obvious interference was observed in presence of other metal ions (Na$^+$, K$^+$, Ca$^{2+}$, Mg$^{2+}$, Al$^{3+}$, Mn$^{2+}$, Ni$^{2+}$, Cu$^{2+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, Co$^{2+}$, Pb$^{2+}$, Hg$^{2+}$, Cd$^{2+}$). The bands appearing in the UV region (200–340 nm) are characteristics of the ligand, HL, ${\bf 1}$. In the complexes [Fe$^{\text{III}}$(HL)$_2$]Cl$_3$, ${\bf 1a}, and [Ni$^{\text{II}}$(HL)$_2$]Cl$_2$, ${\text{1b}}$, these ligand centered bands are accompanied by multiple bands extending into the visible region (350–500 nm). The association constants ($K_{\text{ass}}$, UV-Vis) were found to be ($6 \cdot 4865 \pm 0 \cdot 004$)$\times  10^5$ for the complex ${\bf 1a}$ and ($1 \cdot 1960 \pm 0 \cdot 002$)$\times  10^5$ for the complex ${\bf 1b}$ at 298 K determined by the UV-Vis spectroscopy. On excitation at 285 nm, the ligand HL, ${\bf 1}$ strongly emits at 364 nm due to an intraligand$^1$($\pi – \pi^\ast$) transition. The complexes are luminescent ($\lambda_{\text{ex}}$ 285 nm, $\lambda_{\text{em}}$ 365 nm) with $F/F_0$ $0 \cdot 75$ for ${\bf 1a}$ and $0\cdot 81$ for ${\bf 1b}$. In both the cases, the 1 : 2 binding is confirmed by Job’s method. Molecular structure of the complex ${\bf 1b}$ has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Here, two crystallographically distinct but metrically very similar molecules making an enantiomeric pair constitute the asymmetric unit in which both metal atoms are tris chelated in meridional geometry.</p>

					<p>Reactions of four reducing radical species namely $e^–_{\text{aq}}$, H-atoms, (CH$_3$)$_2^\bullet$COH and $^{\bullet}$CO$^–_2$ radicals with [Co(III)(phendione)$_2$Cl$_2$]Cl (complex) have been studied by electron pulse radiolysis. Time resolved transient absorption spectra for all the four species show two peaks which match with those of phendione anion radical produced by the reaction of e$^–_{\text{aq}}$ with phendione. However, there are some differences in the spectral and kinetic features in the reactions of H-atoms and $^{\bullet}CO^–_2$ radicals with the complex which are elaborated. Steady state absorption spectra on irradiation under reducing conditions indicate breakdown of the complex. The anion radical initially produced has fairly long lifetime of few 100 microseconds. Spectral studies show that initial site of attack for electron transfer is the phendione moiety. Subsequently the electron is transferred to other sites resulting in aquation/decomposition to metal ion. Conductometric studies show that conductance substantially increases on irradiation and could be attributed to aquation/de-ligation of the complex by intramolecular electron transfer.</p>

The normal coordinate structural decomposition (NSD) analysis for the out-of-plane displacement of atoms of the macrocyclic ring in CuT(4-C$_n$P)PBr4 ($n = 4, 6$) indicates mainly saddled distortion combined with small contribution from wave conformation. The electrochemical studies on MT (4-C$_n$P)PBr$_4$ (M = 2H, Cu(II), Zn(II)) revealed cathodic shift in redox potentials in contrast to the corresponding brominated porphyrins, MTPPBr$_4$. This is perhaps due to non-planarity of the porphyrin ring and the positive inductive effect of the alkyloxy groups.</p>

				<page>0239-0245</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ten new binuclear singly oxo-bridged molybdenum complexes (complexes ${\bf 1–10}$) were prepared using five pyrimidine derived Schiff base ligands and two Mo(V) precursors (NH$_4$)$_2$MoOCl$_5$ and (NH$_4$)$_2$MoOBr$_5$. The ligands are prepared by the condensation of 4,6-dimethyl 2-hydrazino pyrimidine with salicylaldehyde (for HL$_1$), $o$-hydroxy acetophenone (for HL$_2$) and substituted salicylaldehydes (for HL$_3$, HL$_4$ and HL$_5$) respectively. These ligands are already reported as good donors for Mo(VI) state. The $\mu$-oxo Mo(V) complexes reported here bears a distorted octahedral geometry around each Mo atom with either N$_2$O$_2$Cl or N$_2$O$_2$Br chromophores. Fine variations in the spectroscopic behaviour of the complexes are observed in accordance with the varying electron donating properties of the ligands. All the complexes are unstable in solution and X-ray quality crystal of complex ${\bf 1}$ could be isolated. All the complexes are characterized by IR and UV-Vis spectra.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Eight indole derivatives were studied for their DNA binding ability using fluorescence quenching and molecular docking methods. These indole compounds have structural moieties similar as in few indole alkaloids. Experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that indole derivatives bind in the minor groove of DNA. Thermodynamic profiles of DNA complexes of indole derivatives were obtained from computational methods. The complexes were largely stabilized by H-bonding and van der Waal’s forces with positive entropy values. Indole derivatives were found to possess some Purine (Pu) – Pyrimidine (Py) specificity with DNA sequences. The results obtained from experimental and computational methods showed good agreement with each other, supported by their correlation constant values.</p>

				<title>A comparative study of the spectroscopic features of the low-lying electronic states of H$_2$F$^+$ and H$_2$Cl$^+$ ions</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0259-0269</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Configuration interaction studies of H$_2$F$^+$ and H$_2$Cl$^+$ ions, using 6-311G ($3d$, $3p$) basis sets, have revealed several interesting differences in their spectral behaviour. Both of them are having bent ground state (${}^1$A$_1$) equilibrium geometries, but there is a huge difference ($\tilde 1\cdot 93$ eV) between their energy barrier to linearity. Their first two excited states are found to be linear ${}^3\Pi_u$ and ${}^1\Pi_u$ states, correlating to ${}^3$B$_1$/${}^3$A$_1$ and ${}^1$B$_1$/${}^1$A$_1$ Renner–Teller pairs, respectively, in the C$_{\text{2v}}$ symmetry. Considering only the allowed singlet–singlet transitions at the ground state equilibrium geometry, the lowest energy transitions found to have transition moment values of $0 \cdot 65$ D and $0 \cdot 48$ D for H$_2$F$^+$and H$_2$Cl$^+$, respectively, appearing in the far UV region. Conical intersections take place during the symmetrical stretching of two H–Cl bonds in the chloronium ion for the first two pairs of excited states ($1^3$A$_2$/$1^3$B$_1$ and $1^1$A$_2$/$1^1$B$_1$) in the C$_{\text{2v}}$ symmetry. This intersection may initiate pre-dissociation from the upper bound adiabatic 1A″ state to the lower repulsive ${}^1$A" state in the C$_s$ symmetry. Fluoronium ion is expected to dissociate via a single electronic state due to the absence of such intersection.</p>

				<title>Direct electrochemistry of hemoglobin entrapped in dextran film on carbon ionic liquid electrode</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0271-0278</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Direct electrochemistry of hemoglobin (Hb) entrapped in the dextran (De) film on the surface of a room temperature ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIMPF$_6$) modified carbon paste electrode (CILE) has been investigated. UV-Vis and FT–IR spectroscopy showed that Hb retained its native structure in the De film. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated an uniform film was formed on the electrode surface. Cyclic voltammetric experiments indicated that the electron transfer efficiency between Hb and the electrode was greatly improved due to the presence of the De film and ionic liquid, which provided a biocompatible and higher conductive interface. A pair of well-defined and quasi-reversible redox peak was obtained with the anodic and cathodic peaks located at $–0 \cdot 195$ V and $–0 \cdot 355$ V in pH $7 \cdot 0$ phosphate buffer solution, respectively. The electrochemical parameters were calculated by investigating the relationship of the peak potential with the scan rate. The fabricated De/Hb/CILE showed good electrocatalytic ability to the reduction of H$_2$O$_2$ with the linear concentration range from $4 \cdot 0 \times 10^{–6}$ to $1 \cdot 5  \times  10^{–5}$ mol/L and the apparent Michaelis–Menten constant ($K_M^{\text{app}}$) for the electrocatalytic reaction was calculated as $0 \cdot 17$ $\mu$M.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The electrodeposition of Ni–Co alloy from a nickel Watt’s solution in the absence and presence of a permanent parallel magnetic field (PPMF) to the plane of deposition (perpendicular to direction of current) produced a deposited layer with mostly fine grain structure. The deposited layers  have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). It was found that the mass deposition rate with PPMF was greater than the deposition in the absence of PPMF, where the rate of difference electrodeposited mass ($\Delta m$) was calculated ($\Delta m = 0 \cdot 07$ to $0 \cdot 12$ mg cm$^{–2}$min$^{–1}$). In the presence of PPMF, the electrodeposition of cobalt was high (0 to 5%) compare to the absence of PPMF. The corrosion resistance of Ni–Co alloy layers fabricated by PPMF proved higher than without PPMF.</p>

				<feature>Perspective Articles</feature>
				<page>0295-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Advances in supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering reported from India within the last decade are highlighted in the categories of new intermolecular interactions, designed supramolecular architectures, network structures, multi-component host–guest systems, cocrystals, and polymorphs. Understanding self-assembly and crystallization through X-ray crystal structures is illustrated by two important prototypes – the large unit cell of elusive saccharin hydrate, Na$_{16}$(sac)$_{16}  \cdot  30$H$_2$O, which contains regular and irregular domains in the same structure, and by the Aufbau build up of zinc phosphate framework structures, e.g. ladder motif in [C$_3$N$_2$H$_{12}$][Zn(HPO$_4$)$_2$] to layer structure in [C$_3$N$_2$H$_{12}$][Zn$_2$(HPO$_4$)$_3$] upon prolonged hydrothermal conditions. The pivotal role of accurate X-ray diffraction in supramolecular and structural studies is evident in many examples. Application of the bottomup approach to make powerful NLO and magnetic materials, design of efficient organogelators, and crystallization of novel pharmaceutical polymorphs and cocrystals show possible future directions for interdisciplinary research in chemistry with materials and pharmaceutical scientists. This article traces the evolution of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering starting from the early nineties and projects a center stage for chemistry in the natural sciences.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Binuclear complexes [Cu($\mu$-RSSR)]$_2$ (${\bf 1}$) and [M$_2$($\mu$-PDS)(H$_2$O)]$_2$ (M = Cu(II), ${\bf 2}$; Fe(II), ${\bf 3}$), where H$_2$RSSR is a reduced Schiff base derived from 2-(thioethyl)salicylaldimine having a disulphide moiety and H$_2$PDS is derived from dimerization of D-penicillamine, have been prepared, structurally characterized, and their photo-induced DNA cleavage activity studied. The crystal structure of ${\bf 1}$ shows the complex as a discrete binuclear species with each metal in a CuN2O2 square-planar geometry (Cu$\ldots$Cu, $6 \cdot 420$ &#197;). The tetradentate RSSR$^{2–}$ acts as a bridging ligand. The sulphur atoms in the disulphide unit do not interact with the metal ions. Complexes ${\bf 1–3}$ do not show any DNA cleavage activity in darkness. The copper(II) complexes exhibit chemical nuclease activity in the presence of 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Cleavage of supercoiled DNA has been observed in UV-A light of 365 nm for ${\bf 1}$ and red light of $647 \cdot 1$ nm for both ${\bf 1} and ${\bf 2}$ in air. Mechanistic data reveal the involvement of the disulphide unit as photosensitizer generating hydroxyl radicals (${}^{\bullet}$OH) as the reactive species. Photo-induced DNA cleavage in red light seems to involve sulphide radicals in a type-I process and hydroxyl radicals. The dicopper(II) complexes show significant anaerobic photo-induced DNA cleavage activity in red light under argon following type-I pathway without involving any reactive oxygen species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Rates of electron transfer reaction of thioglycolic acid with vanadium(V) substituted Keggintype heteropolyanion, [PV$^V$V$^V$W$_{10}$O$_{40}$]$^{5–}$, in acetate–acetic acid buffers have been measured spectrophotometrically at 25$^\circ$C. The order of the reaction with respect to substrate and oxidant is unity. The reaction shows simple second order kinetics at constant pH. The rate of the reaction increases with increase of pH of the medium. The mono-anion HSCH$_2$COO$^–$ and di-anion ${}^–$SCH$_2$COO$^–$ are found to be the reactive species. Rate constants for mono-anion and di-anion are evaluated from rate law derived from the mechanism. By applying Rehm–Weller relationship, self exchange rate constant for the ${}^–$SCH$_2$COO$^–$/S$^{\bullet}$ CH$_2$COO$^–$ couple was evaluated as $3 \cdot 3 \times 10^3$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$ at 25$^\circ$C.</p>

				<title>Adsorption of DOPC vesicles on hydrophobic substrates in the presence of electrolytes: A QCM and reflectometry study</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0341-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The adsorption of lipid Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) vesicles on a hydrophobic substrate has been investigated in aqueous buffer solution by means of the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and reflectometry. DOPC vesicles were prepared by the injection method on a hydrophobic substrate using 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) self-assembled on a gold-coated AT-cut quartz. The reflection spectrometry measurements of the adsorbed vesicles showed nearly monolayer formation in few cases, while in most other experiments, the frequency changes measured suggested multilayer formation assuming the usual Sauerbrey equation to hold in the present system as well. Presence of NaCl, KCl, Na$_2$SO$_4$ and ethanol in the aqueous phase during the formation of vesicles suggest that the multilayer formation can be hastened in some cases. Atomic force microscopic study corroborate the thicknesses that range between 8 and 20 nm for high concentration of electrolytes or ethanol suggesting coalescence of vesicles leading to several bilayers possibly stacked over each other.</p>

				<page>0349-0362</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, the interfacial and bulk behaviour of the amphiphiles hexadecylammonium bromide and its methyl and ethanolic head group analogues in buffered aqueous and gelatin solution has been examined. The analogues are of two categories: the methyl and the combined methyl and ethanolic head group representatives are considered as Group A compounds, and all non-methyl but ethanolic head group species are taken as Group B compounds. Different physical techniques have been employed to ascertain the amphiphilic behaviour in solution. The self-aggregation of these surfactants at different pH has been studied along with pH dependent interfacial activity of gelatin. The interaction of the two categories of the surfactants with gelatin at different pH has been investigated. A scheme for this interaction at various stages of the process has been proposed. The influence of the surfactant head groups on the interaction process has been assessed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A computational study for the [$2 + 1$] addition of the lithium carbenoids LiCH$_2$X (X = Cl, Br, I) with ketene have been investigated by means of the B3LYP hybrid density functional method. All the reactions examined displayed similar concerted mechanisms for the cyclopropanation of these reagents. The lithium carbenoids react with ketene via an asynchronous attack on one CH$_2$ or C group of ketene with relatively low barrier to reaction in the range of $25 \cdot 34–33 \cdot 74$ kJ/mol in THF solvent. The trend of the lithium carbenoids reaction barrier with ketene is LiCH$_2$Cl &lt; LiCH$_2$Br &lt; LiCH$_2$I. The results show that the reactions could be highly chemical reactivity with low barriers and could be favoured in experiment. The reactions could proceed easily at lower temperature. The computational results are briefly compared to other carbenoid reactions and related species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>ZrMCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieves were synthesized by using the zirconium sulfate as zirconium source and using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as a template under microwave irradiation condition. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductive coupled plasma (ICP) technique, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR) and N$_2$ physical adsorption, respectively. The effect of the different initial ZrO$_2$ : SiO$_2$ molar ratio, the different thermal treatment temperature and hydrothermal treatment time on textural property was investigated. The results show that the obtained products possess a typical mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and have specific surface areas in the range of $598 \cdot 1 ~ \tilde ~ 971 \cdot 4$ m$^2$/g and average pore sizes in the range of ca. $2⋅46 ~ \tilde ~ 3 \cdot 43$ nm. On the other hand, the BET specific surface area and pore volume of the synthesized ZrMCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieve decrease with the increased amount of zirconium incorporated in the starting material, the rise of thermal treatment temperature and the prolonging of hydrothermal treatment time, the mesoporous ordering deteriorates. The mesoporous structure of the ZrMCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieve still retains after calcination at 750$^\circ$C for 3 h or hydrothermal treatment at 100$^\circ$C for 6 days, however, the mesoporous ordering is poor.</p>

					<p>Nano-sized Pt–Ru supported onto a mixed-conducting polymer composite comprising poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulphonic acid (PEDOT–PSSA) is employed as anode in a solid-polymer-electrolyte direct methanol fuel cell (SPE–DMFC) and its performance compared with the SPE–DMFC employing conventional Vulcan XC-72R carbon supported Pt–Ru anode. Physical characterization of the catalyst is conducted by Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) in conjunction with cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The study suggests that PEDOT–PSSA to be a promising alternative catalyst-support-material for SPE–DMFCs.</p>

				<title>Studies on interaction between CdTe quantum dots and $\alpha$-chymotrypsin by molecular spectroscopy</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0391-0400</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, the interaction between $\alpha$-Chymotrypsin and CdTe QDs was investigated by fluorescence, synchronous fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic methods at pH $7\cdot 20$ and pH $9 \cdot 05$. The intrinsic fluorescence of $\alpha$-Chy is quenched by CdTe QDs. Under different pH conditions, the level of binding constants is determined to be 10$^3$ from fluorescence data. The hydrogen bond or van der Waals force is involved in the binding process when pH is $9 \cdot 05$, while the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions play main role in the binding process when pH is $7 \cdot 20$. The red-shift of synchronous fluorescence spectral peak of protein after the addition of CdTe QDs reveals that the microenvironments around tryptophan residues are disturbed by CdTe QDs. The secondary structure of $\alpha$-Chy undergoes slight changes as similar by far-UV CD data. The activity and stability of $\alpha$-Chy in the presence of CdTe QDs were also studied. $\alpha$-Chy can maintain its high activity and stability under different pH conditions for 24 h in the presence of CdTe QDs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The NO electro-oxidation was investigated at various single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) modified electrodes by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Compared with the glassy carbon electrode, the SWCNTs modified electrodes possess higher electro-catalytic activity to NO electro-oxidation. CV results indicate that the peak current density of NO electro-oxidation at the SWCNT–COOH (SWCNTs with carboxyl groups) modified electrode is the highest and the peak potential is the most negative among the four kinds of electrodes. EIS indicates that the charge transfer resistance of NO electro-oxidation at the SWCNT–COOH modified electrode is the least. The determined factors (charge transfer and mass transfer of diffusion) of NO electro-oxidation are different in varied potential region. The mechanism of NO electro-oxidation reaction at the SWCNTs modified electrodes is also discussed.</p>

					<p>A convenient method for the synthesis of sesquilignan $\textit{threo}$- and $\textit{erythro}$-($\pm$)-divanillyltetrahydrofuran ferulate is described. The synthesis was based on a unified synthetic strategy involving two Stobbe condensations to give the skeleton of lignan, and then reduction reaction to form $\textit{meso}$- and $\textit{threo}$-($\pm$)-secoisolanciresinol. $\textit{meso}$- and $\textit{threo}$-($\pm$)-secoisolanciresinol were separated by flash column chromatography, followed by intramolecular reaction with TsCl to afford the key intermediate $\textit{meso}$- or $\textit{threo}$-($\pm$)-shonanin, then condensation with ferulaic acid to obtain sesquilignan $\textit{threo}$- or its analogue $\textit{erythro}$-($\pm$)-divanillyltetrahydrofuran ferulate.</p>

				<title>Interplay between multiple length and time scales in complex chemical systems</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0459-0470</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Processes in complex chemical systems, such as macromolecules, electrolytes, interfaces, micelles and enzymes, can span several orders of magnitude in length and time scales. The length and time scales of processes occurring over this broad time and space window are frequently coupled to give rise to the control necessary to ensure specificity and the uniqueness of the chemical phenomena. A combination of experimental, theoretical and computational techniques that can address a multiplicity of length and time scales is required in order to understand and predict structure and dynamics in such complex systems. This review highlights recent experimental developments that allow one to probe structure and dynamics at increasingly smaller length and time scales. The key theoretical approaches and computational strategies for integrating information across time-scales are discussed. The application of these ideas to understand phenomena in various areas, ranging from materials science to biology, is illustrated in the context of current developments in the areas of liquids and solvation, protein folding and aggregation and phase transitions, nucleation and self-assembly.</p>

				<title>Study of multi-site chemical exchange in solution state by NMR: 1D experiments with multiply selective excitation</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0471-0480</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chemical exchange in solution state has been investigated traditionally by both 1D and 2D NMR, permitting the extraction of kinetic parameters (e.g. the spin-lattice relaxation time $T_1$, the exchange rate constant $k$ and the activation parameters). This work demonstrates a simple 1D NMR approach employing multiply selective excitation to study multi-site exchange processes in solution, applying it to systems that exhibit three-site exchange. This approach involves simultaneous excitation of all – or a chosen subset of – the exchanging sites by using an appropriately modulated shaped radiofrequency pulse. The pulse sequence, as well as analysis is summarized. Significant features of the experiment, which relies on sign labelling of the exchanging sites, include considerably shorter experiment time compared to standard 2D exchange work, clear definition of the exchange time window and uniform pulse non-ideality effects for all the exchanging sites. Complete kinetic information is reported in the study of dynamic processes in superacid solutions of two weak bases, studied by ${}^1$H NMR. An analytical solution, leading to the determination of four rate parameters, is presented for proton exchange studies on these systems, which involve a mixture of two weak bases in arbitrary concentration ratio, and stoichiometric excess of the superacid.</p>

				<title>Excited state intramolecular charge transfer reaction of 4-(morpholenyl) benzonitrile in solution: Effects of hetero atom in the donor moiety</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0481-0490</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) molecule with an extra hetero atom in its donor moiety has been synthesized in order to investigate how ICT reaction is affected by hetero atom replacement. Photo-physical and photo-dynamical properties of this molecule, 4-(morpholenyl)benzonitrile (M6C), have been studied in 20 different solvents. The correlation between the reaction driving force ($–\Delta G_r$) and activation barrier ($\Delta G^{&#35;}$) has been explored in order to understand the solvent effects (static and dynamic) on the photo-excited ICT reaction in this molecule. A Kramer’s model analysis of the experimentally observed reaction rate constants indicates a solvent-averaged activation barrier of $\tilde ~ 4 k_BT$ in the absence of solvent dynamical control. The reaction in M6C is therefore not a barrier-less reaction but close to the limit where conventional kinetics might break down.</p>

				<title>A quantum-classical simulation of the nuclear dynamics in NO$^–_2$ and C$_6$H$^+_6$ with realistic model Hamiltonian</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0491-0510</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We perform the nuclear dynamics simulation to calculate the broad band as well as better resolved (a) $\textit{photodetachment}$ spectra of nitrogen dioxide anion (NO$^–_2$), and (b) $\textit{photoelectron}$ spectra of benzene radical cation (C$_6$H$^+_6$) with $\textit{degeneracy}$ among the electronic states using our $\textit{parallelized}$ time dependent discrete variable representation approach. For this purpose, we first consider a theoretical model that describes the photodetachment spectrum originating due to the Franck–Condon (FC) transition from the anionic ground state to the conically intersecting $\tilde{X}^2 A_1 - \tilde{A}^2 B_2$ electronic manifold of the neutral NO$_2$, whereas two multi-state, multi-mode model Hamiltonians of C$_6$H$^+_6$ with degeneracy among the electronic states are explored for its’ photoelectron spectra. The dynamics of C$_6$H$^+_6$ has been carried out with two Hamiltonians: (a) one consists with $\textit{four states and nine modes}$, and (b) the other is constituted with $\textit{three states and seven modes}$. Since the electronic states of both the systems are interconnected by several conical intersections in the vicinity of the FC region, it would be challenging to persue the dynamical calculation due to the impact of non-adiabaticity among the electronic states. The spectral profiles obtained with the advent of TDDVR approach show reasonably good agreement with the results obtained by other theoretical methodologies and experimental measurements.</p>

				<title>NIR–FT Raman, FT–IR and surface-enhanced Raman scattering and DFT based theoretical studies on the adsorption behaviour of (S)-Phenylsuccinic acid on silver nanoparticles</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0511-0519</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Single crystals of ($S$)-phenylsuccinic acid (SPSA) were grown by the slow evaporation technique and vibrational spectral analysis was carried out using near-IR Fourier transform Raman and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. The density functional theoretical (DFT) computations were also performed at the B3LYP/6–311G(d, p) level to derive the equilibrium geometry, vibrational wavenumbers and intensities. Vibrational spectral investigation confirmed the formation of cyclic dimers in the crystal, with the carboxyl groups of each acid molecule being hydrogen bonded to those of the adjacent molecules. The Raman vibrational wavenumbers of the adsorption geometry of (S)-phenylsuccinic acid (SPSA) on a silver surface have been simulated using DFT-B3PW91 with lanl2dz basis set and it compared with the experimental spectrum. The large enhancement of in-plane bending and ring breathing modes in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectrum indicates that the molecule is adsorbed on the silver surface in an `at least vertical’ or slightly tilted orientation, with the ring perpendicular to the silver surface. The calculated vibrational spectra are in agreement with experimental values confirming the validity of the proposed adsorption configurations.</p>

				<title>The solvent and substituent effects on bond dissociation energies of NO-donor molecules containing the N–NO bond</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0521-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum chemical calculations are used to estimate the equilibrium N–NO bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for 15 NO-donor molecules in acetonitrile. These compounds are studied by employing the hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP, B3PW91, B3P86) methods together with 6-31G$^{\ast\ast}$ basis set. The basis set superposition error (BSSE) and zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) are considered. The results are compared with the available experimental results. It is demonstrated that B3LYP/6-31G$^{\ast\ast} is accurate to compute the reliable BDEs for the NO-donor molecules. The solvent effects on the N–NO BDEs are analysed and the result shows that the N–NO BDEs in a vacuum computed by B3P86/6-31G$^{\ast\ast}$ method are the closest to the computed values in acetontrile and the average solvent effect is $0 \cdot 78$ kcal/mol. Subsequently, the substituent effects on the N–NO BDEs are further analysed and it is found that electron donating group stabilizes the radical and as a result BDE decreases; whereas electron withdrawing group stabilizes the ground state of the molecule and thus increases the BDE.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated the structure and magnetic properties of the perovskite oxides of the formula La$_2$Fe$_{1–x}$Mn$_{2x}$Cr$_{1–x}$O$_6$ ($0 &lt; x &lt;  1 \cdot 0$). For $0 &lt; x  \leq  0 \cdot 5$, the members adopt the orthorhombic ($\textit{Pbnm}$) structure, where the transition metal atoms are disordered at the $4$b sites and the MO$_6$ (M = Fe, Mn, Cr) octahedra become increasingly distorted with increasing $x$. For $0 \cdot 65 \leq  x &lt; 1 \cdot 0$, the members adopt the rhombohedral (R-3c) structure that is similar to LaMnO$_{3+\delta}$ ($\delta \geq 0 \cdot 1$) where the MO$_6$ octahedra are undistorted. While the magnetic properties of the latter series are largely similar to the parent LaMnO$_{3+\delta}$ arising from the double-exchange (DE) between mixed valent Mn$^{\text{III}}$/Mn$^{\text{IV}}$, the magnetic properties of the orthorhombic members show a distinct (albeit weak) ferromagnetism ($T_C ~ \tilde ~ 200$ K) that seems to arise from a Mn$^{\text{III}}$-mediated superexchange (SE) between Fe$^{\text{III}}$/Cr$^{\text{III}}$ in the disordered perovskite structure containing Fe$^{\text{III}}$, Mn$^{\text{III}}$ and Cr$^{\text{III}}$.</p>

The number of steps and, in particular, the starting temperature of decomposition of these complexes depends on the equatorial ligand. Also, formation constants of the complexes have been determined by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy through titration of the ligands with the metal ions at constant ionic strength ($0 \cdot 1$ M NaClO$_4$) and at 25$^\circ$C. According to the thermodynamic studies, as the steric character of the ligand increases, the complexation tendency to VO(IV) center decreases. Also, the $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations were carried out to determine the structural and the geometrical properties of the complexes.</p>

				<title>$N$-2,4-Dichlorobenzoyl phosphoric triamides: Synthesis, spectroscopic and X-ray crystallography studies</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0549-0559</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New phosphoric triamides $\textbf{1–9}$ were synthesized by the reaction of $N$-2,4-dichlorobenzoyl phosphoramidic dichloride with various cyclic aliphatic amines and the products were characterized by ${}^1$H, ${}^{13}$C, ${}^{31}$P NMR, IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Surprisingly, the ${}^1$H NMR spectrum of ${\bf 2}$ indicated long range ${}^6J$ (P, H) coupling constant = $1 \cdot 3$, $1 \cdot 4$ Hz and those of molecules ${\bf 3, 4, 6–8}$ display longrange ${}^4J$ (H, H) coupling constants ($1 \cdot 8–1 \cdot 9$ Hz) for the coupling of aromatic protons in 2,4-dichlorophenyl rings. ${}^1$H NMR spectra indicated ${}^3J$ (PNCH) for enantiotopic and diastereotopic benzylic CH$_2$ protons in compounds ${\bf 7}$ and ${\bf 8}$. The spectroscopic data of newly synthesized compounds were compared with those related $N$-benzoyl derivatives. The structures of compounds ${\bf 5}$, ${\bf 8}$ and ${\bf 10}$ (2,4-Cl$_2$-C$_6$H$_3$C(O)NHP(O)[NCH$_2$CH(CH$_3$)$_2$]$_2$) have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The structures form centrosymmetric dimers through intermolecular strong –P=O$\ldots$H–N-hydrogen bonds. The dimers connect to each other via rather strong and weak C–H$\ldots$O plus weak C–H$\ldots$Cl H-bonds to produce a 1-D network for ${\bf 5}$ while 3-D polymeric chains for ${\bf 8}$  and ${\bf 10}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Efficient use of the readily accessible chiral $C_2$-symmetric acyclic diamines (${\bf 1–2}$) as well as macrocyclic amines (${\bf 3–5}$) containing $\textit{trans}$-1,2-diaminocyclohexyl moiety as chiral solvating agents (CSA) for the determination of enantiomeric excess of representative carboxylic acids (${\bf 6–7}$) and an amino acid derivative (${\bf 8}$) is illustrated. The enantiomeric composition of different carboxylic acids estimated here by the ${}^1$H NMR method, based on the integration of the corresponding methine proton signals are in good correlation with that determined using HPLC method. The data are in accordance with the formation of multimolecular diastereomeric complexes in solution, which render good splitting of NMR signals for the enantiomers of representative carboxylic acids as well as for $N$-Ts-phenylglycine (up to $\Delta \Delta \delta = 0 \cdot 295$ ppm, 118 Hz).</p>

				<title>Generation of nitryl chloride from chlorotrimethylsilane-acetyl nitrate reaction: A one-pot preparation of $\textit{gem}$-chloronitro compounds from oximes</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0571-0577</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>While $\textit{iso}$-amyl nitrite reacts with chlorotrimethylsilane to give NOCl, $\textit{iso}$-amyl nitrate does not yield NO$_2$Cl with silicon reagent. However, acetyl nitrate reacts successfully with chlorotrimethylsilane to give nitryl chloride, which is characterized by its UV spectrum. If it is generated in presence of ketoximes, $\textit{gem}$-chloronitro as well as $\textit{gem}$-chloronitroso compounds are formed in almost equal amounts, which together account for up to 80&#37; yield. This is possibly the simplest one-pot reaction for the preparation of $\textit{gem}$-chloronitro compounds which find several synthetic applications. If NO$_2$Cl is generated in presence of cycloalkenes, the corresponding 1,2-dichlorocycloalkanes are obtained. Considering the evidence in hand, it is proposed that NO$_2$Cl, initially formed by chlorotrimethylsilane-acetyl nitrate reaction, decomposes to Cl$_2$, and N$_2$O$_4$. Then chlorine reacts with oximes to produce first $\textit{gem}$-chloronitroso compounds, which are oxidized by NO$_2$Cl or N$_2$O$_4$ to $\textit{gem}$-chloronitro compounds, and with cycloalkenes it gives dichlorocycloalkanes.</p>

				<title>Conformation of hindered piperidines: Spectroscopic evidence for contribution of boat conformations</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0579-0586</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High resolution ${}^1$H and ${}^{13}$C NMR resonance assignments and conformational assignments were carried out for four $t(3)$-benzyl-$r$(2),$c$(6)-$bis$(aryl)piperidin-4-ones ${\bf 1–4}$ and their four $N$-nitroso-$t(3)$-benzyl-$r(2)$,$c(6)$-$bis$(aryl)piperidin-4-ones ${\bf 5–8}$. In addition to conventional 1D NMR methods, 2D shiftcorrelated NMR techniques (${}^1$H–${}^1$H COSY and ${}^1$H–${}^{13}$C COSY) were used for signal assignments. At room temperature the $t(3)$-benzyl-$r(2)$,$c(6)$-$bis$(aryl)piperidin-4-ones ${\bf 1–4}$ exist in only one isomeric form whereas their $N$-nitroso derivatives ${\bf 5–8}$ exist in two isomeric forms. The preferred conformations of both the isomeric forms of nitrosamines were determined by comparison of the spectral data with those of the corresponding parent amines ${\bf 1–4}$ and with the aid of substituent parameters. The results indicate the presence of an equilibrium mixture of boat forms ${\bf B}_1$ and ${\bf B}_2$ for Z isomers of ${\bf 5–8}$. For the E isomers of ${\bf 5–8}$, boat form ${\bf B}_1$ is predicted to be the major conformer. The piperidin-4-ones ${\bf 1–4}$ exist in normal chair conformations with equatorial orientations of all the substituents.</p>

					<p>A series of benzotriazole derivatives (compounds ${\bf 1–27}$) were synthesized, and ${\bf 24}$ (compounds ${\bf 1–5}$, ${\bf 9–27}$) of which were first reported. Their chemical structures were confirmed by means of 1H NMR, IR and elemental analyses, coupled with one selected single crystal structure (compound ${\bf 1}$). All the compounds were assayed for antibacterial activities against three Gram positive bacterial strains ($\textit{Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus}$ and ${\textit Streptococcus faecalis}$) and three Gram negative bacterial strains ($\textit{Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa}$ and $\textit{Enterobacter cloacae}$) by MTT method. Among the compounds tested, most of them exhibited potent antibacterial activity against the six bacterial strains. Most importantly, compound $\textit{3-benzotriazol-1-yl-1-(4-bromo-phenyl)-2-[1,2,4]triazol-1-ylpropan-1-one}$ (${\bf 19}$) showed the most favourable antibacterial activity against $\textit{B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, E. coli}$ and $\textit{E. cloacae}$ with MIC of 1.56 $\mu$g/mL, 1.56 $\mu$g/mL, 1.56 $\mu$g/mL, 3.12 $\mu$g/mL, 6.25 $\mu$g/mL and 6.25 $\mu$g/mL, respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mordenite (HM) catalysts with three different Si/Al ratios were compared for their activity and selectivities in gas phase toluene isopropylation with isopropanol. Catalyst with Si/Al ratio $44\cdot 9$ offered better cumene selectivity, hence, it was chosen for detailed kinetic investigations. The influence of various process parameters like temperature, time-on-stream, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), reactant mole ratio on this catalyst activity are discussed. The cymene selectivity was found to increase with reaction temperature and passed through a maximum at 473 K. The deactivation with time-onstream is almost negligible. Lower isopropyl alcohol concentration in the feed improved cymene selectivity. The conversion and selectivity to cymenes were compared with those of the large pore beta catalyst. The rate constant and activation energy were found to be $7 \cdot 34$ m$^3$/kg h and $41 \cdot 84$ kJ/mol, respectively using homogeneous kinetic model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The cyclo-dehydrogenation of ethylene diamine and propylene glycol to 2-methylpyrazine was performed under the atmospheric conditions at 380$^\circ$C. The Cr-promoted Cu-Zn/Al$_2$O$_3$ catalysts were prepared by impregnation method and characterized by ICP-AES, N$_2$ adsorption/desorption, XRD, XPS, N$_2$O chemisorption, TPR and NH3-TPD techniques. The amorphous chromium species existing in Cu-Zn-Cr/Al$_2$O$_3$ catalyst enhanced the dispersion of active component Cu, promoted the reduction of catalyst. Furthermore, the catalytic performance was significantly improved. The acidity of the catalyst played an important role in increasing the 2-MP selectivity. To optimize the reaction parameters, influences of different chromium content, reaction temperature, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), reactants molar ratio and time on stream on the product pattern were studied. The results demonstrated that addition of chromium promoter revealed satisfying catalytic activity, stability and selectivity of 2-methylpyrazine.</p>

The structure of the Cd(II)-containing ionic liquid (Cd–IL) has been characterized by X-ray crystallography, IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The molecule contains one 1,3-dibutyl-benzotriazolium cation and an anionic Cd coordination entry. The electrochemical property of Cd–IL bulk-modified carbon paste electrode (Cd–IL/CPE) has been studied by cyclic voltammetry. The Cd–IL has functions both as a binder and an electrocatalyst. The Cd–IL/CPE shows good electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide.</p>

				<title>Tungstate as a synergist to phosphonate-based formulation for corrosion control of carbon steel in nearly neutral aqueous environment</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0639-0649</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synergistic inhibition of corrosion of carbon steel in low chloride aqueous medium using tungstate as a synergist in combination with $N,N-bis$(phosphonomethyl) glycine (BPMG) and zinc ions is presented. The synergistic action of tungstate has been established through the present studies. The new ternary inhibitor formulation is effective in neutral and slightly acidic as well as slightly alkaline media. Potentiodynamic polarisation studies inferred that the formulation functions as a mixed inhibitor. Impedance studies of the metal/solution interface revealed that the surface film is highly protective. Characterisation by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the surface film formed in presence of the inhibitor revealed the presence of iron, phosphorus, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, zinc and tungsten in the surface film. The chemical shifts in the binding energies of these elements inferred that the surface film is composed of iron oxides/hydroxides, zinc hydroxide, heteropolynuclear complex [Fe(III), Zn(II)–BPMG] and WO$_3$. Reflection absorption FTIR spectroscopic studies also supported the presence of these compounds in the surface film. Morphological features of the metal surface studied in the absence and presence of the inhibitor by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are also presented. Based on all these results, a plausible mechanism of corrosion inhibition is proposed.</p>

				<title>Controlled release of diclofenac sodium from pH-responsive carrageenan-g-poly(acrylic acid) superabsorbent hydrogel</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0651-0659</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, controlled release of diclofenac sodium (DS) from pH-sensitive carrageenan-gpoly(acrylic acid) superabsorbent hydrogels was investigated. The hydrogels were prepared by graft copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA) onto kappa-carrageenan, using ammonium persulfate (APS) as a free radical initiator in the presence of methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) as a crosslinker. Infrared spectroscopy was carried out to confirm the chemical structure of the hydrogel. Moreover, morphology of the samples was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The synthesized hydrogels were subjected to equilibrium swelling studies in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (SGF and SIF). Hydrogels containing drug DS, at different drug-to-polymer ratios, were prepared by direct adsorption method. The loading yield was found to depend on both the impregnation time and the amount of encapsulated drug. In vitro drug-release studies in different buffer solutions showed that the most important parameter affecting the drug-release behaviour of hydrogels is the pH of the solution. The mechanism involved in release was Fickian ($n \leq  0 \cdot 43$, $n = 0 \cdot 348$) and Super Case II kinetics ($n &gt; 1$, $n = 1 \cdot 231$) at pH $1 \cdot 2$ and $7 \cdot 4$, respectively.</p>

				<title>Crystal engineering: A brief overview</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Organic and Related Solids</feature>
				<page>0667-0675</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Crystal structures of organic and metal-organic compounds have been determined in enormous numbers over the past century, and at the time of writing this review, the Cambridge Structural Database has just crossed the half million mark. The possibility of designing a particular crystal packing is, however, of more recent origin and the subject of $\textit{crystal engineering}$ has addressed this possibility, more or less systematically, during the past 30 years. Crystal engineering demands a detailed and thorough knowledge of intermolecular interactions, which act as the supramolecular glue that binds molecules into crystals. It also requires systematic strategies for the design of a crystal, the architectural blueprint as it were. Finally, this enterprise needs to be geared towards a useful property in that the crystal that is being designed is a functional one. All these features of the subject are directly or indirectly connected with the fact that there is a very large database of known crystal structures that is available to the crystal engineer. This review attempts to briefly survey the current scenario in this expanding subject.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Six crystal structures of substituted 2-chloroquinoline derivatives have been analysed to evaluate the role of Cl atom as a self recognizing unit resulting in the formation of Cl$\ldots$Cl and C–H$\ldots$Cl interactions to generate supramolecular assembly in the solid state. The features of Type I and Type II geometries associated with Cl$\ldots$Cl interactions have been analysed to show directional preferences leading to differences in the packing motifs in these crystal structures. C–H$\ldots$Cl interactions are generated exclusively in structures depicting Type II Cl$\ldots$Cl interaction have been observed in these structures.</p>

				<title>A novel tetraarylpyrene host: Conformation-dependent inclusion of guest molecules in the crystal lattice</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Organic and Related Solids</feature>
				<page>0697-0706</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tetrakis(2,6-dimethyl-4-acetoxyphenyl)pyrene ${\bf H2}$ containing flexible acetate functionalities at the para positions of sterically-hindered and rigid aryl rings functions as an inclusion host system. Depending on the orientations of the acetate functionalities, a variety of conformers may indeed be expected. A limited number of the crystal structures of the inclusions compounds of ${\bf H2}$ reveal that one indeed observes 2 different conformations for the host based on the orientations of the acetate functionalities. The inclusion compound of ${\bf H2}$ with benzene guest molecules is particularly appealing in terms of how the latter are held in trough domains of the host by weak C−H$\cdots$O and C−H$\cdots \pi$ hydrogen bonds. More experimentation and analyses of crystal structures of such systems is expected to lead to better insights toward realizing multicomponent molecular crystals in a rational manner.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The reactions of $bis$(pyridylcarboxamido)alkanes (amides) and $bis$(3-pyridyl)alkanediamides (reverse amides) with copper(II) and zinc(II) in the presence of various anions resulted in onedimensional polymeric crystalline complexes with or without guest inclusion. The crystal structure analyses of these complexes reveal that the one-dimensional networks observed here are of three types: simple linear chain, chains with wavy nature and chains containing cavities. The self-complementary amide groups of the ligands assembled these coordination networks into higher dimensional architectures via N–H$\cdots$O hydrogen bonds.</p>

A detailed packing analysis has been undertaken to delineate the role of second sphere C–H$\cdots$F and C–H$\cdots$O interactions amid other heteroatom interactions. The complex salts have been characterized by elemental analyses, spectroscopic studies (IR, UV/Visible, multinuclear NMR), conductance and solubility product measurements. Single crystal X-ray structure determination revealed ionic structures of both the complex salts having discrete ions along with lattice water molecules. Crystal lattice is stabilized by a variety of hydrogen bonding interactions, i.e. O–H$\cdots$O, C–H$\cdots$O and C–H$\cdots$F involving second sphere coordination besides $\pi-\pi$ interaction. Furthermore, packing analyses reveal that C–H$\ldots$F interactions can manifest even in the presence of a large number of heteroatom interactions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Both crystallite size effects and structural disorder contribute to the broadening of lines in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of layered materials. Stacking faults, in particular, are ubiquitous in layered materials and aside from broadening also induce peaks due to select reflections to shift away from the Bragg positions. The effect of structural disorder has to be suitably discounted before the application of the Scherrer formula for the estimation of crystallite size.</p>

				<title>Crystallization of copper(II) sulfate based minerals and MOF from solution: Chemical insights into the supramolecular interactions</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Organic and Related Solids</feature>
				<page>0757-0769</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Crystallization of solids, molecular or non-molecular from solution is a supramolecular reaction. Nucleation of a lattice structure at supersaturation can be conceived to result from a critical nucleus, a high energy intermediate (supramolecular transition state). Conceptualization of a structure for the critical nucleus in terms of aggregation of tectons through non-covalent interactions provides chemical insights into the architecture of a solid. The retrosynthetic analysis of copper-based minerals and materials offers an elegant description for the crystal packing. It addresses the influence of the geometry, functionality and reactivity of copper tecton(s) in directing a specific supramolecular aggregation. The mechanistic approach provides guiding principles to chemists to account for the experimentally crystallized solids and a platform to practice structure-synthesis correlation. Rationalization of the same composition with different atomic arrangements (polymorphs), compositional variation leading to different pseudopolymorphs, degree of hydration (anhydrous to hydrated), water clusters, role of solvent, etc. can all be justified on molecular basis. Also, the method gives predictive components including directions to synthesize new solids. In a nutshell, the paper is an attempt to generalize the crystallization of inorganic solids from solution by recognizing supramolecular interactions between metal tectons and gain insights for designing new MOF.</p>

				<title>Effect of metal ion doping on the photocatalytic activity of aluminophosphates</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Organic and Related Solids</feature>
				<page>0771-0785</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The metal ions (Ti$^{+4}$, Mg$^{+2}$, Zn$^{+2}$ and Co$^{+2}$) have been substituted in place of Al$^{+3}$ in aluminophosphates (AlPOs). These compounds were used for the first time as possible photocatalysts for the degradation of organic dyes. Among the doped AlPOs, ZnAlPO-5, CoAlPO-5, MgAlPO-11, 18 and 36 did not show any photocatalytic activity. MgAlPO-5 showed photocatalytic activity and different loading of Mg (4, 8, 12 atom &#37; of Mg) were investigated. The activity can be enhanced by the increasing of concentration of the doped metal ions. TiAlPO-5 (4, 8, 12 atom &#37; of Ti) showed the highest photocatalytic activity among all the compounds and its activity was compared to that of Degussa P25 (TiO$_2$). The activity of photocatalysts was correlated with the diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectra.</p>

					<p>Two new coordination polymers of Zn(II) and Cd(II) have been synthesized using 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt), where it acts as a bi-bridging ligand. The compounds are characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Compound [Zn(tpt)(NO$_3$)$_2$(H$_2$O)$_2$]$_n$ (${\bf 1}$) and [Cd(tpt)(NO$_3$)$_2$(H$_2$O)$_2$]$_n$ (${\bf 2}$) are isomorphous and show 1D coordination structure with almost octahedral metal center, which is extended to supramolecular 3D structure by cooperative weak interactions, like H-bonding, $\pi-\pi$ and C–H$\ldots$O interactions. Both the compounds reveal interplay of covalent and non-covalent interactions for fabricating supramolecular solid-state architecture.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>New Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) type phase LaSr$_2$MnCrO$_7$ has been synthesized by ceramic method. Rietveld profile analysis shows that the phase crystallizes with tetragonal unit cell in the space group I4/mmm. The electrical resistivity of the phase has been measured in the temperature range of 10–300 K using Leybold closed cycle helium cryostat. The phase shows insulator–metal (I–M) transition at low temperature, the phenomenon often associated with giant magnetoresistance. 3D variable range hopping governs the electrical conduction in the insulator region above the I–M transition temperature. Magnetic susceptibility of the phase has been measured in the temperature range of 100–300 K. Magnetic studies suggest that the phase is ferromagnetic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The optically active tetra-$\beta$-[($S$)-2-octanyloxy]-substituted copper and nickel phthalocyanines were synthesized via a two-step route with 4-nitro-phthalonitrile and ($S$)-2-octanol as the starting materials. Both compounds are fully characterized by MS, ${}^1$H NMR, UV-Vis, IR, CD and elemental analysis, and soluble in common organic solvents except methanol. The results showed that they were dispersed into single molecules in chloroform and dichloromethane, but prone to congregate into H-type aggregates in ethanol and diethyl ether. They assembled to H-type aggregates with left-handed helix when deposited as thin films.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Simple synthesis and biological properties of flocoumafen ${\bf 1}$ and its structural isomers are described. The key synthetic strategies involve Knoevenagel condensation, Grignard reaction, intramolecular ring cyclization and coupling reaction. Flocoumafen ${\bf 1}$ was easily separated into $cis$ and $\textit{trans}$ forms using flash column chromatography. They were then evaluated for suppression of LPS-induced NO generation and anti-excitotoxicity $\textit{in vitro}$. It was found that the $\textit{trans}$-flocoumafen was potent suppressor of NO generation with the concentration of 10 $\mu$M $\textit{in vitro}$, while no significant effect for neurotoxicity in cultured cortical neurons.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The photophysical behaviour of N-(2-hydroxy benzylidene) aniline or most commonly known as salicylideneaniline (SA) has been investigated using the $\textit{ab initio}$ and DFT levels of theory. The quantum chemical calculations show that the optimized non planar enol ($C_1$) form of the SA molecule is the most stable conformer in the ground state and is marked by the twisting of the phenolic and anilino rings of the molecule. The geometry optimizations and the subsequent frequency calculations of the excited singlet electronic states of the various tautomeric forms of SA molecule were performed with the CIS level of theory. A detail theoretical investigation on the relaxation dynamics of the SA molecule has been presented. Possible explanation on the excitation wavelength dependence of the photochromic yield of the molecule is also reported.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Bulk and interfacial properties of ion-pair amphiphiles (IPA), formed between sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and $n$-alkyltrimethylammonium bromide homologues (C$_n$TAB; $n = 10$, 12, 14, 16, and 18), have been investigated. Different phases and aggregated states, formed in the ternary combinations of C$_n$TAB/SDS/H$_2$O, have been identified and described. Equimolar mixture of IPAs in water yielded precipitates, in the form of coacervates. Aqueous solubility of isolated coacervates in presence and absence of additives like cholesterol and bile salts have been examined. The isolated coacervates have been characterized by ${}^1$H NMR, FTIR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarization microscopic measurements. The coacervates have appeared in the shape of needle and complex flower-like aggregates. Surface pressure ($\pi$)-area (A) isotherm of the coacervates at the air/water interface have been constructed and compared with the lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-$sn$-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC). Morphologies of the IPA monolayers at different surface pressures have been also examined by epifluorescence microscopy. The compressed interfacial monolayers have produced spherical (both regular and irregular) and fern-leaf like domains.</p>

				<title>Directed 2-dimensional organisation of collagen: Role of cross-linking and denaturing agents</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0881-0889</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of additives like curcumin and surfactants on the self-assembly of collagen from a simple 2-dimensional system of Langmuir films of the protein at air/solution interface has been attempted in this study using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and dynamic surface tensiometer. Though pure curcumin is not surface active, a synergistic effect of collagen with curcumin seems to lead to enhanced surface activity in the protein. In general, the presence of additives, increases the surface activity of collagen even for the lowest concentration and the largest change in surface activity is seen for collagen with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The results suggest interplay between the unexposed hydrophobic groups, and the opening out and solvation of the more charged or polar groups at the surface leading to aggregation followed by self-assembly. Modulation of aggregation at interface in collagen due to these additives may be an approach that could be explored for possible applications in bio-materials and for delivery of protein–drug complexes.</p>

				<title>Mechanistic investigation on the oxidation of kinetin by Ag(III) periodate complex in aqueous alkaline media: A kinetic approach</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0891-0900</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of amino acid, kinetin (KNT) by diperiodatoargentate(III) (DPA) in alkaline medium at a constant ionic strength of $0 \cdot 5$ mol dm$^{–3}$ was studied spectrophtometrically. The reaction between KNT and DPA in alkaline medium exhibits 1 : 3 stoichiometry (KNT : DPA). Intervention of free radicals was observed in the reaction. Based on the observed orders and experimental evidences, a mechanism involving the monoperiodatoargentate(III) (MPA) as the reactive oxidant species has been proposed. The products, furon-2-methanol and para-nitro-purine were identified by spot test and characterized by spectral studies. The rate constants and associated activation parameters for the proposed mechanism as well as the thermodynamic quantities for different equilibrium steps are reported and discussed.</p>

				<title>Theoretical study of nucleophilic halogenalkylation of propylene oxide with halogenmethane and dihalogenmethane anion</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0901-0909</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nucleophilic halogenalkylation reactions of propylene oxide with halogenmethane anion (CH$_2$X$^–$) and dihalogenmethane anion (CHX$^–_2$) (X = F, Cl) in the gas phase and in the Et$_2$O solvent are studied using the B3LYP method and the SCIPCM model for simulating solution effects. Our calculations predict the same reaction path for following reactions: (1) (X = F, Cl) and (2) (X = F) in the two phases, but there is a little difference in the relative energy of IM1(2Cl) in the gas phase and in the Et$_2$O solvent for reaction (2) (X = Cl). All the four reactions proceed in two steps. Reactions (1) and (2) are predicted to be exothermic and thermodynamically favourable in both the gas phase and the Et$_2$O solvent. The overall barrier energies for reaction (1) (X = F), reaction (1) (X = Cl), reaction (2) (X = F), and reaction (2) (X = Cl) are predicted to be $2 \cdot 74$ and $4 \cdot 08$ kcal mol$^{–1}$, $3 \cdot 35$ and $5 \cdot 20$ kcal $mol^{–1}$, $4 \cdot 67$ and $6 \cdot 05$ kcal mol$^{–1}$, and $5 \cdot 33$ and $8 \cdot 23$ kcal mol$^{–1}$ in the gas phase and in the Et$_2$O solvent, respectively. The accurate calculation of results for the model systems would be useful for experimental researchers working in this field.</p>

				<title>Gold electrode modified by self-assembled monolayers of thiols to determine DNA sequences hybridization</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0911-0917</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The process of immobilization of biological molecules is one of the most important steps in the construction of a biosensor. In the case of DNA, the way it exposes its bases can result in electrochemical signals to acceptable levels. The use of self-assembled monolayer that allows a connection to the gold thiol group and DNA binding to an aldehydic ligand resulted in the possibility of determining DNA hybridization. Immobilized single strand of DNA (ssDNA) from calf thymus pre-formed from alkanethiol film was formed by incubating a solution of 2-aminoethanothiol (Cys) followed by glutaraldehyde (Glu). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to characterize the self-assembled monolayer on the gold electrode and, also, to study the immobilization of ssDNA probe and hybridization with the complementary sequence (target ssDNA). The ssDNA probe presents a well-defined oxidation peak at $+0.158$ V. When the hybridization occurs, this peak disappears which confirms the efficacy of the annealing and the DNA double helix performing without the presence of electroactive indicators. The use of SAM resulted in a stable immobilization of the ssDNA probe, enabling the hybridization detection without labels. This study represents a promising approach for molecular biosensor with sensible and reproducible results.</p>

				<title>Voltammetric determination of theophylline at a Nafion/multi-wall carbon nanotubes composite film-modified glassy carbon electrode</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0919-0926</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A Nafion/multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) composite film-modified electrode was fabricated and applied to the sensitive and convenient determination of theophylline (TP). Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were easily dispersed homogeneously into 0.1&#37; Nafion methanol solution by sonication. Appropriate amount of Nafion/MWNTs suspension was coated on a glassy carbon electrode. After evaporating methanol, a Nafion/MWNTs composite film-modified electrode was achieved. TP could effectively accumulate at Nafion/MWNTs composite film-modified electrode and cause a sensitive anodic peak at around 1180 mV (vs SCE) in $0 \cdot 01$ mol/L H$_2$SO$_4$ medium (pH $1 \cdot 8$). In contrast with the bare glassy carbon electrode, Nafion film-modified electrode, Nafion/MWNTs film-modified electrode could remarkably increase the anodic peak current and decreased the overpotential of TP oxidation. Under the optimized conditions, the anodic peak current was proportional to TP concentration in the range of $8 \cdot 0  \times  10^{–8}–6 \cdot 0 \times 10^{–5}$ mol/L, with a detection limit of $2 \cdot 0 \times  10^{–8}$ mol/L. This newly developed method was used to determine TP in drug samples with good percentage of recoveries.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Scheelite type solid electrolytes, Li$_{0 \cdot 5}$Ce$_{0 \cdot 5−x}$Ln$_x$MoO$_4$ ($x = 0$ and $0 \cdot 25$, Ln = Pr, Sm) have been synthesized using a solid state method. Their structure and ionic conductivity ($\sigma$) were obtained by single  crystal X-ray diffraction and ac-impedance spectroscopy, respectively. X-ray diffraction studies reveal a space group of $I4_1/a$ for Li$_{0 \cdot 5}$Ce$_{0 \cdot 5−x}$Ln$_x$MoO$_4$ ($x = 0$ and $0 \cdot 25$, Ln = Pr, Sm) scheelite compounds. The unsubstituted Li$_{0 \cdot 5}$Ce$_{0 \cdot 5}$MoO$_4$ showed lithium ion conductivity $\tilde ~10^{−5}–10^{−3} \Omega^{−1}$cm$^{−1}$ in the temperature range of 300–700$^\circ$C ($\sigma = 2.5 \times 10^{−3} \Omega^{−1}$cm$^{−1}$ at 700$^\circ$C). The substituted compounds show lower conductivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, with the magnitude of ionic conductivity being two (in the high temperature regime) to one order (in the low temperature regime) lower than the unsubstituted compound. Since these scheelite type structures show significant conductivity, the series of compounds could serve in high temperature lithium battery operations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Laser flash photolysis study on highly fluorescent and stable salt of 9-phenylxanthenium cation in neutral condition has been carried out for the first time. A new transient absorption band of this extensively studied system that perhaps remained buried under the fluorescence envelope and hitherto undetected has been identified and attributed to the triplet state of the system. This oxygen-insensitive triplet–triplet absorption band in the 480–600 nm range is expected to trigger new studies exploring the reactivity of the triplet state of this system, which has so far received very little attention.</p>

Employing the recent works of Deskevich, Hayes, Takahashi, Skodje, and Nesbitt (DHTSN) potential energy surface of the ground $1^2$A' electronic state, the present work calculates the polarizationdependent differential cross sections and the three angular distributions which describe the vector correlations among the product angular momentum ${\bf j'}$ and the reagent and the product initial relative velocities ${\bf k}$ and ${\bf k'}$. The effect of vibrational and rotational excitations for the reagent FCl and the influence of collision energies on the stereodynamical quantities are also investigated and discussed.</p>

				<title>Metathesis of carbon dioxide and phenyl isocyanate catalysed by group(IV) metal alkoxides: An experimental and computational study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0029-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The insertion reactions of zirconium(IV) $n$-butoxide and titanium(IV) $n$-butoxide with a heterocumulene like carbodiimide, carbon dioxide or phenyl isocyanate are compared. Both give an intermediate which carries out metathesis at elevated temperatures by inserting a second heterocumulene in a head-to-head fashion. The intermediate metallacycle extrudes a new heterocumulene, different from the two that have inserted leading to metathesis. As the reaction is reversible, catalytic metathesis is feasible. In stoichiometric reactions heterocumulene insertion, metathesis and metathesis cum insertion products are observed. However, catalytic amounts of the metal alkoxide primarily led to metathesis products. It is shown that zirconium alkoxides promote catalytic metathesis (isocyanates, carbon dioxide) more efficiently than the corresponding titanium alkoxide. The difference in the metathetic activity of these alkoxides has been explained by a computational study using model complexes Ti(OMe)$_4$ (${\bf 1bTi}$) and Zr(OMe)$_4$ (${\bf 1bZr}$). The computation was carried out at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level of theory.</p>

					<p>Heteroleptic ruthenium(II) bipyridyl complex, $cis$-Ru(II)(4,4'-$bis$(4-$tert$-butylstyryl)-2,2'-bipyridyl) (4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridyl) (NCS$_2$) (${\bf H}$112) was synthesized and characterized by ${}^1$H-NMR, MASS, Spectrofluorometer and UV-Vis spectroscopes. The photo-voltaic performance of the sensitizer was evaluated in Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) under irradiation of AM $1 \cdot 5$ G solar light and the photovoltaic characteristics were compared with those of reference cells of ${\bf HRS}$1 and ${\bf N}$719 fabricated under comparable conditions. Compared to ${\bf N}$719, ${\bf H}$112 sensitizer showed enhanced molar extinction coefficient and relatively better monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) across the spectral range of 400 to 800 nm with solar energy-to-electrical conversion efficiency ($\eta$) of $2 \cdot 43$&#37; [open circuit photovoltage $({\bf V}_{OC}) = 0 \cdot 631$V, short-circuit photocurrent density (${\bf J}_{SC}$) = $8 \cdot 96$ mA/cm$^2$, fill factor (ff) = 0$\cdot$430], while $\eta$ values of $2 \cdot 51$&#37; (${\bf V}_{OC} = 0 \cdot 651$ V, ${\bf J}_{SC} = 9 \cdot 41$ mA/cm$^2$, ff = 0$\cdot$410) and $2 \cdot 74$&#37; (${\bf V}_{OC} = 0 \cdot 705$ V, ${\bf J}_{SC} = 8 \cdot 62$ mA/cm$^2$, ff $= 0 \cdot 455$) were obtained for ${\bf HRS}$1 and ${\bf N}$719 sensitized solar cells respectively.

				<abstract>
					<p>Aqueous reaction of ammonium thiosulfate with piperazine (pip) results in the formation of the title compound (pipH$_2$)[S$_2$O$_3$]$\cdot$H$_2$O ${\bf 1}$ (pipH$_2$ = piperazinediium) in good yield. ${\bf 1}$ was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, Raman andNMRspectra, X-ray powder pattern and its structure was determined. On heating at 100$^\circ$C, ${\bf 1}$ transforms to anhydrous piperazinediium thiosulfate ${\bf 2}$, which can be rehydrated to the monohydrate on exposure tomoisture. The structure of ${\bf 1}$ consists of two crystallographically independent piperazinediium (pipH$_2$)$^{2+}$ cations located on inversion centers, a thiosulfate anion and a lattice water. The organic cations, thiosulfate anion and lattice water are linked by six varieties of hydrogen bond namely O–H$\cdots$O, O–H$\cdots$S, N–H$\cdots$O, N–H$\cdots$S, C–H$\cdots$O and C–H$\cdots$S, leading to the formation of alternating layers of (pipH$_2$)$^{2+}$ cations and water linked thiosulfate chains. A comparative study of several compounds charge balanced by the piperazinediium cation is described.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two series of click chemistry assisted alkoxymethyl-1H-[1,2,3]-triazol-1-yl containing sidechain liquid-crystalline polymethacrylates were synthesized by free radical polymerization technique. Mesogen was linked to backbone through various spacer units. Monomers and polymers were characterized by FT-IR, ${}^1$H and ${}^{13}$C-NMR spectral techniques. Thermal stability of polymers was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis. Mesomorphic property and phase transition temperature of polymers were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry and polarized optical microscopy. Phase transition temperature and mesomorphic property of polymers with respect to insertion of polar alkoxy group on terminal triazole ring and spacer length between backbone and mesogen were investigated. Polymers exhibited grainy like textures under polarized optical microscopy. Spacer length between mesogen and backbone alters phase transition temperature of the polymers.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two silver(I) complexes $\{$[1-R-4-($N-t4-butylacetamido)-1,2,4-triazol-5-ylidene]$_2$Ag$\}^+$ Cl$^−$ [R = Et (${\bf 1b}$), $i$-Pr (${\bf 2b}$)] of $N/O$-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbenes derived from 1,2,4-triazoles are reported. The silver complexes, ${\bf 1b}$ and ${\bf 2b}$, have been synthesized from the reaction of the $N/O$-functionalized triazolium chloride salts namely, 1-R-4-(N-t-butylacetamido)-1,2,4-triazolium chloride [R = Et (${\bf 1a}$), $i$-Pr (${\bf 2a}$)] by treatment with Ag$_2$O in 53–56&#37; yield. The 1,2,4-triazolium chloride salts ${\bf 1a}$ and ${\bf 2a}$ were prepared by the alkylation reaction of 1-R-1,2,4-triazole (R = Et, $i$-Pr) with $N-t$-butyl-2-chloro acetamide in 47–63&#37; yield. The molecular structures of the silver(I) complexes, ${\bf 1b}$ and ${\bf 2b}$, have been determined by X-ray diffraction studies. The density functional theory studies on the silver 1b and 2b complexes suggest that the 1,2,4-triazole derived N-heterocyclic carbenes to be strong $\sigma$−donating ligands similar to the now much recognized imidazolebased N-heterocyclic carbenes. The reactivity studies with (SMe$_2$)AuCl and (SMe$_2$)CuBr indicated the silver complexes, ${\bf 1b}$ and ${\bf 2b}$, to be good transmetallating agents.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The chemistry of organo-gallium and indium complexes with dithiolate and internally functionalised oxo ligands has been explored. With 1,1-dithiolate ligands both classical and organometallic complexes of gallium and indium, [M(S$^\cap$S)$_3$], [RM(S$^\cap$S)$_2$] and [R$_2$M(S$^\cap$S)] (where R = Me or Et; M = Ga or In; S$^\cap$S = RCS$_2$, ROCS$_2$, R$_2$NCS$_2$ and (RO)$_2$PS$_2$) have been isolated. Reactions of internally functionalised oxo ligands with R$_3$MR\cdot$OEt$_2$ afforded diorganometal complexes [R$_2$ML]$_n$. Molecular structures of several of these complexes have been established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Complexes derived from oxo ligands showed photoluminescence. They have been used as alkylating agents for C–C coupling reactions of aryl bromides in the presence of PdCl$_2$(PPh$_3$)$_2$. Indium dithiolate complexes have been used as molecular precursors for the preparation of mono dispersed ẞ-In$_2$S$_3$ nanoparticles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Recent trends in the area of intramolecularly coordinated organomercury and organochalcogens derivatives are reviewed. Intramolecular coordination in organomercury derivatives facilitates the formation of mercurametallamacrocycle and leads to novel metal–metal interaction with closed shell ions. It also plays a key role in stabilizing telluroxanes as well as in the activation of chalcogen–carbon bonds.</p>

					<p>Hydrolytic and solvolytic ring opening reactions of phthalic anhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride and 2,3-pyridine dicarboxylic anhydride in the presence of various transition metal salts with or without a ancillary ligands were studied. The reactions were found to be dependent on stoichiometry of ligand and types of anhydride used. In the case of pyromellitic dianhydride selective ring opening reaction by cobalt(II) ions gave 1,3-benzene dicarboxylate derivatives, whereas use of copper(II) ions gave 1,4-benzene dicarboxylate derivatives. Preference for methanolysis was seen in the case of copper (II) promoted reactions of pyromellitic dianhydride in the presence of 1:1 metal to 1,10-phenanthroline ratio.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis and X-ray structure of a new bismuth dipicolinate cooordination polymer, $\{$[Bi((2,6-O$_2$C)$_2$C$_5$H$_3$N)((2-HO$_2$C-6-O$_2$C)C$_5$H$_3$N)(H$_2$O)]$_2$.5H$_2$O$\}_n$ (${\bf 7}$) are presented. Compound ${\bf 7}$ has dimeric units with a Bi$_2$O$_2$ skeleton that are linked by additional weak Bi–O interactions leading to a polymeric structure. The overall coordination number at bismuth is 9 [two Bi–N and seven Bi–O bonds]. New routes to a second crystalline modification (${\bf 4}'$) of the previously reported coordination polymer, bismuth $tris$(picolinate), [Bi(2–O$_2$C–C$_5$H$_4$N)$_3$]$_n$ (${\bf 4}$), are described; bond parameters in the two crystalline forms (${\bf 4}$ and ${\bf 4}'$) are compared. In both the compounds ${\bf 4}'$ and ${\bf 7}$, bismuth has a distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry.</p>

				<title>Phenalenyl-based ligand for transition metal chemistry: Application in Henry reaction</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Modern trends in inorganic chemistry (MTIC-XIII)</feature>
				<page>0139-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the synthesis and characterization of the first transition metal complex of a phenalenylbased ligand. The reaction of Cu(OAc)$_2$.H$_2$O with 9-$N$-methylamino-1-$N$'$-methylimino-phenalene (${\bf LH}$) in 1:1 stoichiometric ratio results in the formation of a mononuclear copper complex [LCu(OAc)] (${\bf 1}$). The molecular structure of ${\bf 1}$ was established by X-ray crystallography. The electrochemistry of ${\bf 1}$ indicates the formation of an anionic radical by one electron reduction into the non-bonding molecular orbital of the phenalenyl system. The complex ${\bf 1}$ efficiently catalyses the C–C bond forming Henry reaction.</p>

				<title>Mononuclear non-heme iron(III) complexes of linear and tripodal tridentate ligands as functional models for catechol dioxygenases: Effect of $N$-alkyl substitution on regioselectivity and reaction rate</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Modern trends in inorganic chemistry (MTIC-XIII)</feature>
				<page>0145-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Catechol dioxygenases are responsible for the last step in the biodegradation of aromatic molecules in the environment. The iron(II) active site in the extradiol-cleaving enzymes cleaves the C–C bond adjacent to the hydroxyl group, while the iron(III) active site in the intradiol-cleaving enzymes cleaves the C–C bond in between two hydroxyl groups. A series of mononuclear iron(III) complexes of the type [Fe(L)Cl$_3$], where L is the linear $N$-alkyl substituted $bis$(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)amine, $N$-alkyl substituted $N$-(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)ethylenediamine, linear tridentate 3N ligands containing imidazolyl moieties and tripodal ligands containing pyrazolyl moieties have been isolated and studied as structural and functional models for catechol dioxygenase enzymes. All the complexes catalyse the cleavage of catechols using molecular oxygen to afford both intra- and extradiol cleavage products. The rate of oxygenation depends on the solvent and the Lewis acidity of iron(III) center as modified by the sterically demanding $N$-alkyl groups. Also, our studies reveal that stereo-electronic factors like the Lewis acidity of the iron(III) center and the steric demand of ligands, as regulated by the $N$-alkyl substituents, determine the regioselectivity and the rate of dioxygenation. In sharp contrast to all these complexes, the pyrazole-containing tripodal ligand complexes yield mainly the oxidized product benzoquinone.</p>

				<title>Cobalt(III)-oxo cubane clusters as catalysts for oxidation of organic substrates</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Modern trends in inorganic chemistry (MTIC-XIII)</feature>
				<page>0163-0173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Transition metal coordination complexes play a vital role as catalysts in the oxidation of organic substrates including renewable chemicals in an economically viable and environmentally friendly way. Here we highlight the preparation, characterization and application of oxo-cubane complexes of cobalt(III) as oxidation catalysts using air and water as oxidants. Cobalt(III)-oxo complexes of the type Co$_4$O$_4$(O$_2$CR)$_4$L$_4$ have been prepared by a general method and these have been characterized by analytical, spectroscopic, electrochemical and crystallographic methods. These soluble complexes have shown promising utility as catalysts in the aerobic oxidation of side chains of alkylaromatic hydrocarbon compounds. Oxidation of neat ethylbenzene has shown very high conversion and selectivity for acetophenone formation. On the other hand, oxidation of $p$-xylene has been found to yield both $p$-toluic acid and terephthalic acid. It is also possible to oxidize $p$-xylene in an aqueous medium under moderate applied O$_2$ pressure. Selective epoxidation of $\alpha$-pinene with air as the oxidant also takes place with the cobalt(III)-based homogeneous catalysts.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Modern trends in inorganic chemistry (MTIC-XIII)</feature>
				<page>0175-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This review covers few examples of anion complexation chemistry, with a special focus on urea/thiourea-based receptors and Zn(II)-dipicolyl amine-based receptors. This article specially focuses on structural aspects of the receptors and the anions for obtaining the desire specificity along with an efficient receptor–anion interaction. Two types of receptors have been described in this brief account; first one being the strong hydrogen bond donor urea/thiourea derivatives, which binds the anionic analytes through hydrogen bonded interactions; while, the second type of receptors are coordination complexes, where the coordination of the anion to the metal centre. In both the cases the anion binding modulate the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and thereby the spectroscopic response. Appropriate choice of the signalling unit may allow probing the anion binding phenomena through visual detection.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, structure and applications of [$cis$-dioxomolybdenum(VI)-(ONO)] type complexes</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Modern trends in inorganic chemistry (MTIC-XIII)</feature>
				<page>0187-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oxo-molybdenum chemistry is of great interest since such units are found in the active sites of a majority of molybdo-enzymes. In order to mimic the biological systems, a number of oxo-molybdenum complexes have been synthesised and studied. This review describes synthesis, structure and applications of oxomolybdenum complexes particularly $cis$-MoO$_2$(${\bf L}$)(D) where ${\bf L}$ stands for a dianionic tridentate ONO ligand and D for a donor solvent molecule/monodentate ligand. The ligand moieties are derived from Schiff base, hydrazide Schiff base and other related tridentate ligands ${\bf L}$(H)$_2$. The coordination geometry around the Mo center in these complexes can be best described as a distorted octahedron in which the ONO-tridentate ligand occupies meridional position with two anionic oxygen donors mutually $\textit{trans}$ and are $cis$ to the oxygen centers of the $cis$-dioxo group. Mostly the applications of $cis$-MoO$_2$-(ONO) type complexes seen in literature are oxo transfer reactions like epoxidation, sulfoxidation and phosphine oxidation reactions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Porphyrin rings containing two meso-pyridyl groups either in cis or trans fashion can be used to construct Re(I) bridged multiporphyrin assemblies. The $cis$-dipyridyl porphyrins with various porphyrin cores such as N$_4$, N$_3$O, N$_3$S, N$_2$S$_2$ have been used to react with Re(CO)$_5$Cl in THF at refluxing temperature and constructed planar Re(I) bridged porphyrin dyads containing either one type of porphyrin subunit or two types of porphyrin subunits. The $trans$-dipyridyl porphyrins have been used to construct Re(I) bridged porphyrin squares. The porphyrin dyads have been explored for singlet–singlet energy transfer studies and porphyrin squares have been used for catalysis, chemical sensing, molecular sieving and photocurrent production studies. An overview of synthesis of Re(I) bridged porphyrin dyads, triads and tetrads and their interesting photophysical properties are highlighted in this paper.</p>

					<p>The design of structural and functional models of enzymes vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases (VHPO) and the isolation and/or generation of species having $\{$VO(H$_2$O)$\}$, $\{$VO$_2\}$, $\{$VO(OH)$\}$ and $\{$VO(O$_2$)$\}$ cores, proposed as intermediate(s) during catalytic action, in solution have been studied. Catalytic potential of these complexes have been tested for oxo-transfer as well as oxidative bromination and sulfide oxidation reactions. Some of the oxidovanadium(IV) and dioxidovanadium(V) complexes have been immobilized on polymer support in order to improve their recycle ability during catalytic activities and turn over number. The formulations of the polymer-anchored complexes are based on the respective neat complexes and conclusions drawn from the various characterization studies. These catalysts have successfully been used for all catalytic reactions mentioned above. These catalysts are stable and recyclable.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Modern trends in inorganic chemistry (MTIC-XIII)</feature>
				<page>0229-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes an account of some of our polyoxometalate (POM)-based research, we have been doing in our laboratory last several years. There are several well-defined POM cluster anions, that are structurally characterized. We have chosen Anderson-type of heteropolyanion [Al(OH)$_6$Mo$_6$O$_{18}$]$^{3−}$ and explored its linking propensity in different dimensions using `s', `d' and `f' block elements as linkers.We have demonstrated how a lanthanide linker provides a new pathway in forming a two-dimensional linked $\{$As$_8$V$_{14}\}$ system [$\{$Ln(H$_2$O)$_6\}_2$As$_8$V$_{14}$O$_{42}$(SO$_3$)]$_n \cdot $8nH$_2$O, that is derived from discrete $\{$As$_8$V$_{14}\}$ cluster containing compound (NH$_4$)$_6$[As$_8$V$_{14}$O$_{42}$(SO$_3$)]. A polyoxometalate compound has been described in which a reduced tungstovanadate–heteropolyanion clusters get linked via capped V = O groups into one-dimensional chains. All these systems have already been reported elsewhere. The last portion of this article will be described by a new system [3-ampH]$_6$[V$_{10}$O$_{28}$]$\cdot$2H$_2$O having discrete molecular structure and extended supramolecular structure.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Liquid crystalline pendant polymeric complexes have been obtained by supramolecular assembly of two mesogenic components namely, poly[4-(10-acryloyloxydecyloxy)-4'- phenylazobenzonitrile] (P10) and 4-alkyloxybenzoic acids (A7-A12). Hydrogen bond formed between carboxylic acid and cyano moiety served as molecular bridge. The polymeric complexes acquitted as undivided liquid crystalline properties exhibited stable and enantiotropic mesophases. The precursor, monomer and polymer were analysed by ${}^1$H-NMR and ${}^{13}$C-NMR spectroscopy. The hydrogen bonding interaction in polymer complexes (P10-A7 to P10-A12) was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. The thermal behaviours and textural analysis were studied by differential scanning calorimetry and polarized optical microscopy respectively.</p>

					<p>Fluorescence spectroscopic techniques have been used to study the excited state intramolecular charge transfer reaction of 4-(1-azetidinyl)benzonitrile (P4C) in two sets of mixed solvents, (1-propanol + ethyl acetate) and (propylene carbonate + acetonitrile), in the absence and presence of a strong electrolyte, lithium perchlorate. These two sets of mixed solvent systems represent binary solvent mixtures of low and high polarities, respectively. Density, sound velocity and viscosity measurements indicate that these two mixed solvent systems are structurally different. Stronger ion-reactant interaction is evidenced in the mole fraction independence of emission frequencies in electrolyte solutions of low polar binary solvent mixtures. For both these mixtures, the reaction driving force ($-\Delta G_r$) decreases with increase in mole fraction of the relatively less polar solvent component of the mixture. Interestingly, $-\Delta G_r$ increases significantly on addition of electrolyte in low polar mixtures and exhibits mixture composition dependence but, in contrast, $-\Delta G_r$ in high polar mixtures does not sense variation in mixture composition in presence of electrolyte. This insensitivity to mixture composition for high polar mixtures is also observed for the measured reaction time constant. In addition, the reaction time constant does not sense the presence of electrolyte in the high polar solvent mixtures. The reaction time constant in low polar mixtures, which becomes faster on addition of electrolyte, lengthens on increasing the mole fraction of the relatively less polar solvent component of the mixture. These observations have been qualitatively explained in terms of the measured solvent reorganization energy and reaction driving force by using expressions from the classical theory of electron transfer reaction.</p>

				<title>Biocatalysis of azidolysis of epoxides: Computational evidences on the role of halohydrin dehalogenase (HheC)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0279-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biocatalytic azidolysis of 9 unsymmetrical epoxides by halohydrin dehalogenase enzyme (HheC) in gas phase and uncatalysed azidolysis of the same epoxides in gas phase and in aqueous solution have been modelled at DFT level. Aliphatic epoxides (1–6) and aromatic epoxides (9) undergo $\beta$ cleavage while styrene oxide (7) and $p$-nitro styrene (8) oxide prefer $\alpha$ cleavage in the gas phase. Inclusion of aqueous solvation effect via Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) increases the activation barrier and makes the reaction endothermic due to extensive solvation of azide anion and oxido anionic products, but does not alter the regioselectivity. Halohydrin dehalogenase from Agrobacterium radiobactor ${\texbf{\it AD1}}$ catalyses (E1–E9) ring opening of all these epoxides by azide ion with $\beta$ selectivity and the reversal of selectivity in epoxide 7 and 8 is notable. These reactions follow, in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic environment, S$_N$2 mechanism. Calculations while agreeing totally with experimental results offer better insights on the factors determining the regioselectivity and particularly the role of enzyme. Active site model and crystal structure data reveal that the Tyr145 and Ser132 form weak hydrogen bonds with epoxide oxygen lone pair and form reactant enzyme complex (REC). The enzyme complex activates the epoxide ring towards azidolysis. The NBO deletion and second order perturbation analyses clearly bring out the role of catalytic duo Tyr145 and Ser132 and particularly shed light on the dominant contribution of Tyr145 in selectively activating C$_{\beta}$–O bond. The present results indicate that Arg149 or other residues in the pocket do not seem to have any significant effect on the reaction.</p>

					<p>Integral cross-section and stereodynamics study of the reaction O(${}^1$D)$+$H$_2$($v = 0$, $j = 0$) $\to$ OH $+$ H is undertaken using the quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method for the collision energy is in the large length of 1.3 to 43 kcal/mol using Dobbyn and Knowles (DK) surface, and the obtained results are compared with those available from earlier available calculated results on the BR surface. The integral cross sections obtained from the quasiclassical trajectory method are in good agreement with those of Chebyshev wave packet method for collision energies above 0.2 eV.We also investigated the vector correlations and polarized dependent differential cross sections (PDDCS) at different collision energies. It is demonstrated that the alignment and state distribution significantly decrease with increase in the collision energy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to explore the potential energy surfaces of C–O bond activation in CO$_2$ molecule by gas-phase Mo$^+$ cation and Mo atom, in order to better understanding the mechanism of second-row metal reacting with CO2. The minimum energy reaction path is found to involve the spin inversion in the different reaction steps. This potential energy curve-crossing dramatically affects reaction exothermic. The present results show that the reaction mechanism is insertion-elimination mechanism along the C–O bond activation branch. All the theoretical results not only support the existing conclusions inferred from early experiment, but also complement the pathway and mechanism for this reaction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A self-supported 40W Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) system has been developed and performance tested. The auxiliaries in the DMFC system comprise a methanol sensor, a liquid-level indicator, and fuel and air pumps that consume a total power of about 5W. The system has a 15-cell DMFC stack with active electrode-area of 45 cm$^2$. The self-supported DMFC system addresses issues related to water recovery from the cathode exhaust, and maintains a constant methanol-feed concentration with thermal management in the system. Pure methanol and water from cathode exhaust are pumped to the methanol-mixing tank where the liquid level is monitored and controlled with the help of a liquid-level indicator. During the operation, methanol concentration in the feed solution at the stack outlet is monitored using a methanol sensor, and pure methanol is added to restore the desired methanol concentration in the feed tank by adding the product water from the cathode exhaust. The feed-rate requirements of fuel and oxidant are designed for the stack capacity of 40W. The self-supported DMFC system is ideally suited for various defense and civil applications and, in particular, for charging the storage batteries.</p>

					<p>We report here the highly sensitive and selective electrochemical determination of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), one of the dopamine metabolites in the presence of important interferents ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) using an ultrathin electropolymerized film of 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol (p-ATT) modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode in 0.20M phosphate buffer solution (pH 5.0). The bare GC electrode fails to resolve the oxidation peaks of AA, DOPAC and UA in a mixture. Further, the oxidation peak potentials of them were shifted to more positive potential with decreased peak currents in the subsequent cycles. On the other hand, the p-ATT modified electrode not only separated the voltammetric signals of AA, DOPAC and UA but also enhanced their peak currents. The amperometric current response was increased linearly with increasing DOPAC concentration in the range of $4.0 \times 10^{−8}$ to $1.0 \times 10^{−5}$ M and the detection limit was found to be 150pM ($S/N =3$).</p>

				<title>Textural and morphological studies on zinc–iron alloy electrodeposits</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0357-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc–iron alloy electrodeposits have industrial significance, since they provide better corrosion resistance and with improved mechanical properties when compared to pure zinc coatings. This is due to the unique phase structure of the alloy formed. But this deposition belongs to anomalous deposition, where the electrochemically less noble zinc deposits more preferentially, than the more noble iron. So the industrial process control over the deposition becomes difficult. So, this study correlates the effect of various deposition parameters over the deposition kinetics and deposited alloy characteristics. Transition and partial current densities were computed. Effect of hydrogen overpotential and surface coverage due to the adsorbed intermediates over anomalous deposition were explored. Plausible deposition mechanism and mathematical model was proposed to predict the anomalous electrodeposition characteristics. Textural, morphological and phase structural characteristics of the alloy was investigated. By the substitution of iron in the hcp lattice, c/a ratio was lowered and the lattice geometry was distorted. Intermetallic compounds of variable composition such as FeZn$_{14}$, Fe$_5$Zn$_{33}$, Fe$_3$Zn$_{13}$ and FeZn$_3$ with `$\eta$' and `$\Gamma$' phase structures were noted. Electrodeposition parameters were optimized and smooth, adherent, strain-free deposits with required iron content and hardness were obtained.</p>

				<title>Pyrene appended bile acid conjugates: Synthesis and a structure–gelation property study</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0379-0391</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A wide variety of novel compounds obtained by combining two types of known organogelators, viz., bile acid alkyl amides and pyrene alkanoic acids, were synthesized and screened for their gelation ability. The 3$\alpha$ esters of 1-pyrene butyric acid (PBA) of alkylamides of deoxycholic acid (DCA) turned out to be effective in the gel formation with many organic solvents although the gelation has to be triggered by the addition of a charge transfer (CT) agent 2,4,7-trinitrofluorenone (TNF). The special feature of these molecules is that the organogelation is achieved only after derivatizing the acid moiety of the 1-pyrenealkanoic acids. Additionally, the gelation properties can be fine-tuned by inserting different functional groups at the bile acid side chain. The gels obtained are deep red in colour and optically transparent up to 2&#37; w/v. The SEM studies of the obtained xerogels revealed bundled rod-like morphology without specialized branching.</p>

				<title>The role of weak intermolecular C–H$\ldots$F interactions in supramolecular assembly: Structural investigations on 3,5- dibenzylidene-piperidin-4-one and database analysis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0403-0409</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fluorinated and non-fluorinated dibenzylidene-4-piperidones were synthesized and their structures examined using X-ray crystallography. Interestingly, the para-fluorosubstituted dibenzylidene compound, in contrast to other analogs, is characterized by C–H$\ldots$F bonded one-dimensional packing motif. To evaluate the ability of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for forming interactions, in general and competitive situation, we have defined statistical descriptors. Analysis of Cambridge Structural Database using these newly defined parameters reveals high propensity of C–H$\ldots$F interactions in organic crystals. The present structural study suggests much larger role of fluorine driven intermolecular interactions that are even though weak, but possess significant ability to direct and alter the packing.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Cetyltrimethylammonium hypochlorite (CTAHC) is prepared and used as an oxidizing agent for nitroso group to nitro group. The $gem$-chloronitroso and $vic$-chloronitroso compounds are prepared respectively from ketoximes and olefins by reacting with NOCl generated $\textit{in situ}$ from chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl) and $iso$-amyl nitrite. CTAHC oxidizes $gem$-chloronitroso and vic-chloronitroso compounds to the corresponding chloronitro derivatives. While $gem$-chloronitro compounds are obtained in good yields, the $vic$-chloronitro derivatives are formed in moderate yields, because of the propensity of the $vic$-chloronitroso group to tautomerize to $\alpha$-chlorooxime. The present method is simple and practical, particularly for the preparation of $vic$-chloronitro compounds, considering the fact that the known methods of their preparation are few and quite involved.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple and efficient method has been developed for the synthesis of series of 4-aryl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2$H$-indeno[1,2-$d$]pyrimidine-2-thiones through Biginelli’s one-pot multicomponent condensation reaction via microwave irradiations. Then, these thiones were converted to their S-alkylated/aralkylated derivatives. The prepared heterocyclic products were structurally confirmed by analytical and spectral data and evaluated for their antibacterial activities. The results showed that this skeletal framework exhibited marked potency as antibacterial agents. The compound 2-(Ethylthio)-4-(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1$H$-indeno[1,2-$d$]pyrimidines 4b have shown antibacterial activity towards all the seven clinical isolates used.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new method for the preparation of enantiopure 2,2-disubstituted 2,3-dihydro-benzofuran-3-ols is described. A short synthesis is designed for obtaining various 2,2-disubstitued benzofuran-3-ols as racemic mixtures of the two possible $syn$ and $anti$ diastereoisomers, which can be separated after silylation. The major racemic $anti$ isomers were transesterified using (R)-pentolactone, allowing separation of the pure enantiomers.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Asymmetric alkyl substitution of various benzophenone Schiff base substrates under biphasic conditions proceeded using optically active Palladium(II) complexes. The corresponding products were obtained in high yields but with moderate enantiomeric excess (ee). Addition of specific ionic liquids to the reaction medium enhanced reactivity and selectivity for phase transfer catalytic (PTC) glycine alkylation. It has been found that there is an anionic influence of the ionic liquids that modify the steric environment around the enolate ion. A computer-assisted molecular design of enantioselective phase-transfer catalysis with the palladium complex and the ionic liquid has been done.</p>

				<title>Proximity effect on the general base catalysed hydrolysis of amide linkage: The role of cationic surfactant, CTABr</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0497-0507</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The $bis$ phenoxide forms of (1,2)$bis$(2-hydroxybenzamido)ethane(${\bf I}$), (1,5)$bis$(2-hydroxybenzamido) 3-azapentane(${\bf II}$), (1,3)$bis$(2-hydroxybenzamido)propane(${\bf III}$), and (1,8)$bis$(2-hydroxybenzamido)3,6-diazaoctane(${\bf IV}$) undergo facile hydrolysis of one of the amide groups ($0.02 \leq$ [OH$^−$]$_T$ (mol dm$^{−3}$) $\leq$ 0.5, 10&#37; MeOH (v/v) $+$ H$_2$O medium) without exhibiting [OH$^−$] dependence. The reactivity trend follows ${\bf I} \tilde {\bf II} &gt; &gt; {\bf III} \tilde {\bf IV}$ with low activation enthalpy $\{25.7\pm 2.8 \leq  \Delta H^{\neq}$(kJ mol$^{−1}$) $\leq 64.8\pm 7.0\}$. The high negative and comparable values of activation entropy $\{−234 \pm 8  \leq \Delta S^{\neq}$(J K$^{−1}$ mol$^{−1}$) $\leq  −127 \pm  20\}$ are consistent with closely similar, and ordered transition states which can be assembled by favourably oriented phenoxide groups. The solvent kinetic isotope effect for $\{bf I}, k^{H2O}/k^{D2O+H2O} \tilde 1$ (20 and 50 volume&#37; D$_2$O), indicates that proton transfer is not involved as a part of the rate controlling process. The observed slowing down of the rate of this reaction for I in the micellar pseudo phase of CTABr also supports the proposed mechanism. Under premicellar conditions, however, rate acceleration is observed, a consequence believed to be associated with the capping effect of the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant cation forming the reactive ion-pair, CTA$^+$, (I-2H)$^{2−}$ exclusively in the aqueous pseudo phase.</p>

While adsorption of CO on noble metals ions is well-known, adsorption of CO on noble metal ions has not been studied because creating exclusive ionic sites has been difficult. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) we have shown that CO gets adsorbed on the noble metal Pt$^{2+}$, Pd$^{2+}$, Cu$^{2+}$ ionic sites in the respective compounds, and the net energy of the overall system decreases. Adsorption of CO on metal ions is also confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, KBiO$_3$ is synthesized by a standard oxidation technique while LiBiO$_3$ is prepared by hydrothermal method. The synthesized catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning ElectronMicroscopy (SEM), BET surface area analysis and Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS). The XRD patterns suggest that KBiO$_3$ crystallizes in the cubic structure while LiBiO$_3$ crystallizes in orthorhombic structure and both of these adopt the tunnel structure. The SEM images reveal micron size polyhedral shaped KBiO$_3$ particles and rod-like or prismatic shape particles for LiBiO$_3$. The band gap is calculated from the diffuse reflectance spectrum and is found to be 2.1 eV and 1.8 eV for KBiO$_3$ and LiBiO$_3$, respectively. The band gap and the crystal structure data suggest that these materials can be used as photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity of KBiO$_3$ and LiBiO$_3$ are evaluated for the degradation of anionic and cationic dyes, respectively, under UV and solar radiations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The photoredox reactions of cobalt(III), nickel(II) complexes and organic dyes are reviewed with particular emphasis on using flash photolysis methods to identify the transients in the time scale from milliseconds to subpicoseconds. The excitation flash radiation initially was limited to flash lamps with a time resolution to study the decay of the excited states and the fast reactions of photo produced transients in milliseconds and microseconds. Some of the photolysis reactions investigated provide details in real time including the thermal reactions of molecular oxygen with cobalt(II) amine systems and the cobalt (III) alkyl complex formation on photolysis of cobalt(III) aminoacid complexes. Photoredox reactions of thiazine and safranine dyes are investigated using time resolved absorption and emission techniques in solution and on encapsulation in micro and mesoporous host materials. Picosecond and femtosecond diffuse reflectance fluorescence investigations in the porous solid host materials show intramolecular proton transfer reactions of the dyes and deprotonation of the dyes in the excited states. Photosensitization of nanoparticles of semiconductors, anatase TiO$_2$ and ZnO by the excited states of dyes in meso and microporous silicate hosts is investigated using pico and femtosecond fluorescence and transient absorptions techniques and the results are reviewed.</p>

The ${\bf H}$101 sensitized solar cell constructed with an active area of 0.54 cm2 in combination with an ionic liquid electrolyte exhibited broader photocurrent action spectrum with solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency ($\eta$) of 5.89 (${\bf J}_{\text{SC}}$ = 12.14 mA/cm$^2$, ${\bf V}_{\text{OC}}$ = 690 V, fill factor = 0.699) under Air Mass (AM) 1.5 sunlight, while the reference `$cis$-Ru(4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine)(${\bf L}$n)(NCS)$_2$', ${\bf Z}$907 sensitized solar cell exhibited $\eta$-value of 5.17&#37; (${\bf J}_{\text{SC}}$ = 11.93 mA/cm$^2$, ${\bf V}_{\text{OC}}$ = 650 V, fill factor = 0.666). TGA analysis of ${\bf H}$101 showed extended thermal-stability and under continuous light exposure and aging at 55$^\circ$C, the DSSC retained 85&#37; of its initial $\eta$-value, while under comparable conditions ${\bf Z}$907 sensitized solar cell retained 88&#37;. As compared to 4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine in ${\bf Z}$907, the new ancillary bipyridyl ligand `4,4'-$bis$(3,5-di-$tert$-butylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine’ in ${\bf H}$101 shifts the absorption bands remarkably towards blue. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent DFT excited state calculations of the new sensitizer show that the first three HOMOs have t2g character with sizeable mixing from the NCS ligands with $\pi$-bonding orbitals of 4,4'-$bis$(3,5-di-$tert$-butylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine. The LUMO is a $\pi^\ast$-orbital localized on the 4,4-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine and higher un-occupied frontier orbitals have $\pi^\ast$-combinations with 4,4'-$bis$(3,5-di-$tert$-butylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series of new hexa-coordinated ruthenium(II) carbonyl complexes of the type [RuCl(CO)(EPh$_3$)(B)(L$^{1−4}$)] (4–15) (E = P or As; B = PPh$_3$, AsPh$_3$ or Py; L = 2'-hydroxychalcone) were synthesized from the reaction of [RuHCl(CO)(EPh$_3$)$_2$(B)] (1–3) (E = P or As; B = PPh$_3$, AsPh$_3$ or Py) with equimolar chalcone in benzene under reflux. The new complexes have been characterized by analytical and spectroscopic (IR, electronic, ${}^1$H, ${}^{31}$P$\{^1$H$\}$, and ${}^{13}$C NMR) methods. On the basis of data obtained, an octahedral structure has been assigned for all the complexes. The complexes exhibit catalytic activity for the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols into their corresponding aldehydes and ketones in the presence of $N$-methylmorpholine-$N$-oxide (NMO) as co-oxidant and were also found to be efficient transfer hydrogenation catalysts. The antifungal properties of the ligands and their complexes have also been examined and compared with standard $\textit{Bavistin}$.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0577-0592</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier and highest energy density fuel. Water gas shift (WGS) reaction is an important reaction to generate hydrogen from steam reforming of CO. A new WGS catalyst, Ce$_{1−x}$Ru$_x$O$_{2−\delta}$ ($0 \leq x \leq 0.1$) was prepared by hydrothermal method using melamine as a complexing agent. The Catalyst does not require any pre-treatment. Among the several compositions prepared and tested, Ce$_{0.95}$Ru$_{0.05}$O$_{2−\delta}$ (5&#37; Ru$^{4+}$ ion substituted in CeO$_2$) showed very high WGS activity in terms of high conversion rate (20.5 $\mu$mol.g$^{−1}$.s$^{−1}$ at 275$^\circ$C) and low activation energy (12.1 kcal/mol). Over 99&#37; conversion of CO to CO$_2$ by H$_2$O is observed with 100&#37; H$_2$ selectivity at $\geq$  275$^\circ$C. In presence of externally fed CO$_2$ and H$_2$ also, complete conversion of CO to CO$_2$ was observed with 100&#37; H$_2$ selectivity in the temperature range of 305–385$^\circ$C. Catalyst does not deactivate in long duration on/off WGS reaction cycle due to absence of surface carbon and carbonate formation and sintering of Ru. Due to highly acidic nature of Ru$^{4+}$ ion, surface carbonate formation is also inhibited. Sintering of noble metal (Ru) is avoided in this catalyst because Ru remains in Ru$^{4+}$ ionic state in the Ce$_{1−x}$Ru$_x$O$_{2−\delta}$ catalyst.</p>

				<page>0593-0599</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The acid catalysed condensation of diketones with pyrrole did not result in the formation of expected divergent bisdipyrromethane always; instead the product depends on the chain length of the diketones, in particular the distance between the two carbonyl functional groups.When the two carbonyl groups are linked via one or two methylene groups, unusual ring annulation occurs resulting in the formation of various bridged bipyrroles. However, on further increase in the length of the spacer, between the two carbonyl groups, synthesis of the expected bisdipyrromethanes could be achieved.</p>

				<page>0681-0685</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A chemoselective Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction process of various aliphatic and allylic $\alpha$,$\beta$-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones is described. This chemoselective reduction is catalysed by boron triisopropoxide B(O$^i$Pr)$_3$. Kinetics of reduction of aldehydes and ketones to corresponding alcohols were also examined and rate constant of each carbonyl compounds were measured. Rate constant and reduction yield of each carbonyl compounds in the presence of B(O$^i$Pr)$_3$ were compared with those in the presence of B(OEt)$_3$. The alcohols that are the reduction product were analysed by GC-MS. The rate constants and alcohol yields were found to be higher with B(OEt)$_3$ than with B(O$^i$Pr)$_3$. The mechanism proposed involves a six-membered transition state in which both the alcohol and the carbonyl are coordinated to the same boron centre of a boron alkoxide catalyst.</p>

					<p>The title compound (C$_9$H$_3$O$_6$·C$_{20}$H$_{17}$N$_4$)$_4$·0.5H$_2$O ${\bf 1}$ was isolated from solvothermal synthesis of 4'-(4-pyridyl)-2,2':6',2'-terpyridine (pytpy) and trimesic acid (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, H$_3$BTC). It was characterized by element analysis, IR, TGA, XRD, X-ray single-crystal diffraction, and spectroscopy properties, together with quantum chemistry calculation of spectrum (UV–vis spectra) through the method b3lyp/6–31 t g (d,p) are also investigated. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction shows ${\bf 1}$ possesses a 3-D supramolecular network with 1-D six-fold helical double chains built from protonated (H$_3$pytpy)$^{3+}_n$ cations and deprotonated (BTC)$^{3−}_n$ anions. The maximum of the fluorescent emission bands of ${\bf 1}$ is located at 427 nm ($\lambda_{\text{ex}}$ = 266 nm), with a shoulder at about 390 nm. The result of theoretic calculations confirms that ${\bf 1}$ has small HOMO–LUMO energy gap (1.24 eV) and high chemical reactivity.</p>

The computed geometric parameters are remarkably close to experimental values. DFT global chemical reactivity descriptors (chemical hardness, total energy, electronic chemical potential, and electrophilicity) are calculated for the isomers and used to predict their relative stability and reactivity. The chemical reactivity indices are found to be related to the bond angle defined by the $cis$ carbonyls and the iron center.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0733-0741</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study deals with the decomposition of haloalkoxy radical (CH$_3$CFClO) formed from 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) in the atmosphere. The sudy is performed using $\textit{ab-initio}$ quantum mechanical methods. Out of the three plausible pathways of decomposition of the titled species, the one that involved the C–C bond scission and the other occurring via Cl-atom elimination have been considered for detailed study. The geometries of the reactant, products and transition states involved in the decomposition pathways are optimized and characterized at MP2 level of theory using 6-311G(d,p) basis set. Single point energy calculations have been performed at G2(MP2) level of theory. The path involving the Cl-elimination is found to be dominant and found to occur with a barrier height of 3.6 kcal mol$^{−1}$ whereas the C–C bond scission path proceeds with a barrier of 10.0 kcal mol$^{−1}$. The thermal rate constants for the above two decomposition pathways are evaluated using Canonical Transition State Theory (CTST) and these are found to be $2.9 \times 10^8 s^{−1}$ and $4.3 \times  10^5 s^{−1}$ for Cl-elimination and C–C bond scission respectively at 298 K and 1 atm. pressure. The existence of transition states on the corresponding potential energy surface is ascertained by the occurrence of only one imaginary frequency obtained during the frequency calculation. The Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) calculation has also been performed to confirm the smooth connection of the TS to the reactant and the products.</p>

				<title>A density functional study on the adsorption of hydrogen molecule onto small copper clusters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0743-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An all-electron scalar relativistic calculation on the adsorption of hydrogen molecule onto small copper clusters has been performed by using density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) at PW91 level. Our results reveal that after adsorption of H$_2$ molecule, the Cu–Cu interaction is strengthened and the H–H interaction is weakened, the reactivity enhancement of H$_2$ molecule is obvious. The VIPs, HLGs and VEAs of Cu$_n$H$_2$ clusters show an obvious odd–even oscillation. It is suggested that the H$_2$ molecule is more favourable to be adsorbed by the even-numbered small copper clusters. Meanwhile, the odd–even alteration of magnetic moments is also observed and may be served as the material with tunable code capacity of `0’ and `1' by adsorbing hydrogen molecule onto odd or even-numbered small copper clusters. Some discrepancies of dissociative adsorption between our work and previous works are found and may be understood in terms of the electron pairing effect and the scalar relativistic effect.</p>

				<title>Theoretical study of the reactivity trends in the Cl-abstraction reactions of CHCl$_3$ $+$ CHX$^{·−}$/CX$_2^{·−}$ (X = Cl, Br and I)</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0755-0763</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To better understand how and to what extent the halosubstituted carbene radical anions effect the chlorine abstraction of CHCl$_3$, a detailed theoretical investigation has been performed at the UMP2/6-311$++$G (d, p)/RECP level of theory. The model system CHCl$_3 + $CHX$^{·−}$/CX$^{·−}_2$ (X = Cl, Br, and I) has been chosen for the present study. According to the detailed discussions of geometries and energetics of the optimized stationary points, our theoretical findings suggest that the Cl-abstraction reactions by CHX$^{·−}$ are energetically favourable, indicating the less massive substitution X in CHX$^{·−}$ the easier abstraction reaction, as compared to those by CX$^{·−}_2$, which are energetically unfavourable and would be endothermic.</p>

				<title>Metal selective co-ordinative self-assembly of $\pi$-donors</title>
				<feature>Special issue to commemorate the International Year of Chemistry 2011</feature>
				<page>0773-0781</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metal selective co-ordinative nanostructures were constructed by the supramolecular co-assembly of pyridine appended TTF (${\bf TTF-Py}$) and pyrene (${\bf PYR-Py}$) derivatives in appropriate solvent composition mixtures with metal ions.Microscopic analyses show that ${\bf TTF-Py}$ shows distinctive morphology with either of these metal ions, forming I-D tapes with 1:1 Pb$^{2+}$ complex and 2-D sheets with 1:2 Zn$^{2+}$ complex. A rationale has been provided from molecular level packing for such hierarchical changes. In case of Cu$^{2+}$, we have observed an anomalous binding of metal ion to the core sulphur groups causing redox changes in the TTF core. ${\bf PYR-Py}$ on the other hand is shown to be a fluorescent sensor for Pb$^{2+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, Hg$^{2+}$ and Ag$^+$. With different fluorescent response for metal complexes, we essentially obtained similar 1-D assemblies suggesting similar binding modes for all of them. Supramolecular approach through which morphology of an electron donor moiety can be engineered by metal ions can be a new tool in nanoelectronics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the synthesis and characterization of some imidazole-based gold-selenolates are described. This study indicates that the nature of selenolate plays an important role in ligand exchange reactions in gold(I) selenolates. Furthermore, the reactivity of imidazole-based gold(I) selenolates toward nucleophiles such as selenols and phosphines is strikingly different from that of the $N,N$-dimethylaminobenzylamine-based gold(I) complexes. The presence of Se$\cdots$N non-bonded interactions in $N,N$-dimethylaminobenzylamine-based gold(I) complexes modulates the reactivity of Au(I) centre towards incoming nucleophiles.</p>

				<title>Ruthenium complexes of chelating amido-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbene ligands: Synthesis, structure and DFT studies</title>
				<feature>Special issue to commemorate the International Year of Chemistry 2011</feature>
				<page>0791-0798</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, structure and density functional theory (DFT) studies of a series of new ruthenium complexes, [1-(R)-3-$N$-(benzylacetamido)imidazol-2-ylidene]RuCl($p$-cymene) [R = Me (${\bf 1}$c), $i$-Pr (${\bf 2c}$), CH$_2$Ph (${\bf 3c}$); $p$-cymene = 4-$i$-propyltoluene] supported over $N/O$-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands are reported. In particular, the ruthenium (${\bf 1–3}$)${\bf c}$ complexes were synthesized from the respective silver complexes, [1-(R)-3-$N$-(benzylacetamido)imidazol-2-ylidene]$_2$Ag$^+$Cl− [R = Me (${\bf 1b}$), $i$-Pr (${\bf 2b}$), CH$_2$Ph (${\bf 3b}$)] by the treatment with [Ru($p$-cymene)Cl$_2$]$_2$ in 65–76&#37; yields. The molecular structures of (${\bf 1–3})${\bf c}$ revealed the chelation of the N-heterocylic carbene ligand through the carbene center and an amido sidearm of the ligand in all of the three complexes. The density functional theory studies on the ruthenium (${\bf 1–3})${\bf c}$ complexes indicated strong binding of the NHC ligand to the metal center as was observed from the deeply buried NHC-Ru $\sigma$-bonding molecular orbitals.</p>

				<title>A Rh$^{\text{III}}$–N-heterocyclic carbene complex from metal–metal singly bonded [Rh$^{\text{II}}$−Rh$^{\text{II}}$] precursor</title>
				<feature>Special issue to commemorate the International Year of Chemistry 2011</feature>
				<page>0799-0805</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metal–metal singly bonded [Rh$_2$(CO)$_4$(acac)$_2$][OTf]$_2$ (${\bf 1}$) has been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and analytical techniques. A density functional theory (DFT) optimized structure has been computed for the unbridged centro-symmetric structure. Reaction of ${\bf 1}$ with PIN.HBr results in the [Rh(PIN)$_2$(H$_2$O)Br][OTf]$_2$ (${\bf 2}$) in high yield. The reaction involves metal-oxidation from Rh$^{\text{II}}$ to Rh$^{\text{III}}$ accompanied by the metal–metal bond cleavage. The X-ray structure of ${\bf 2}$ has been determined which reveals the incorporation of two N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands to each rhodium. This work demonstrates the general utility of the metal–metal bonded compounds for the easy synthesis of metal-NHC compounds.</p>

				<page>0807-0818</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An equimolar mixture of Ni(NO$_3$)$_2$·6H$_2$O and pyridine-2-aldehyde with two equivalents of NaN$_3$ in methanol in the presence of NaOMe resulted in the formation of light green precipitate which upon crystallization from dimethylformamide (DMF) yielded light green single crystals [$\{$Ni$_2$Na$_2$(pic)$_4$(N$_3$)$_2$(H$_2$O)$_2$(MeOH)$\}$· MeOH·3H$_2$O]$_n$ (${\bf 1}$) and [$\{$Ni$_2$Na$_2$(pic)$_4$(N$_3$)$_2$(H$_2$O)$_4\} \cdot$2DMF$\cdot$H$_2$O]$_n$ (${\bf 2}$) (pic = pyridine-2-carboxylate) at room temperature and high temperature (100$^\circ$C), respectively. Variable temperature magnetic studies revealed the existence of overall ferromagnetic behaviour with $J  \approx +10$ cm$^{−1}$ and $D  \approx −2$ to −7 cm$^{−1}$ for ${\bf 1}$ and ${\bf 2}$, respectively. Negative $D$ values as well as variation of $D$ upon slight distortion of structure by varying reaction temperature were observed. The X-band Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra of both ${\bf 2}$ and ${\bf 3}$ were recorded below 50 K. The structural distortion was also implicated from the EPR spectra. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on both complexes were performed in two different ways to corroborate the magnetic results. Considering only Ni$^{\text{II}}_2$ dimeric unit, results were $J = +20.65$ cm$^{−1}$ and $D = −3.16$ cm$^{−1}$ for ${\bf 1}$, and $J =+24.56$ cm$^{−1}$ and $D =−4.67$ cm$^{−1}$ for ${\bf 2}$. However, considering Ni$^{\text{II}}_2$Na$^I_2$ cubane as magnetic core the results were $J =+16.35$ cm$^{−1}$ (${\bf 1}$), +19.54 cm$^{−1}$ (${\bf 2}$); $D =−3.05$ cm$^{−1}$ (${\bf 1}$), −4.25 cm$^{−1}$ (${\bf 2}$).</p>

				<title>Axial phenoxide coordination on di-iron(III) bisporphyrin: Insights from experimental and DFT studies</title>
				<feature>Special issue to commemorate the International Year of Chemistry 2011</feature>
				<page>0827-0837</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, structure and properties of new five-coordinate phenolate complexes of di-iron(III) bisporphyrin are reported here, in which phenol binds in $\eta^1$-fashion as an axial ligand. The solid and solution EPR at 120K and ${}^1$H NMR spectral pattern in solution provide unequivocal evidence for the high spin (S = 5/2) nature of the complex. Mulliken spin density calculation using DFT demonstrates the positive spin densities at the $meso$ carbons and negative spin densities at the methylene carbons and, as a result, the $meso$ and methylene protons are shifted in the upfield and down field regions, respectively in the ${}^1$H NMR spectra of the molecule. Also, the $ortho$- and $para$-protons of the phenolate ligands are observed to be shifted in the upfield region while $meta$-protons are shifted downfield. The alternating shift pattern, which is the opposite sign of the chemical shifts for $meta$-versus $ortho$- and $para$-protons, was also explained due to negative and positive spin densities, respectively on the carbons and indicative of $\pi$ spin delocalization on the phenolate ligand. Thus, the calculated spin density maps accounted for the essential ${}^1$H NMR spectroscopic features that are observed here for the phenolate complexes of di-iron(III) bisporphyrin. The temperature dependence of the signals follows the Curie law which is indicative of single spin state throughout the temperature range of −40 to +40$^\circ$C. The single crystal X-ray structure of the corresponding chloro derivative, $trans$ 1,2-$bis$(chloroiron(III) octaethyl porphyrinyl)ethene, has also been reported here which authenticates the high-spin nature of the complex.</p>

					<p>Two oximate bridged dinuclear complexes [Co$^{\text{II}}_2$ (HL)$_2$](ClO$_4$)$_2$ (${\bf 1}$) and [Fe^{text{II}}_2$ (HL)$_2$](ClO$_4$)$_2$ (${\bf 2}$), and a biomimetic iron(III)-catecholate complex [Fe$^{\text{III}}$(HL)(DBC)] (${\bf 3}$) of a dioxime ligand (H$_2$L = 4,4,9,9-tetramethyl-5,8-diazadodecane-2,11-dione dioxime and DBCH$_2$ = 3,5-di-$tert$-butylcatechol) were synthesized and characterized. X-ray single-crystal structures of both the dinuclear complexes exhibit an out-of-plane oximate bridge where the six-membered M$_2$(NO)$_2$ ring adopt a boat conformation with the metal ions in a fivecoordinate distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Complexes ${\bf 1}$ and ${\bf 2}$ react with dioxygen at ambient condition to form the corresponding hydroxo- or oxo-bridged dinuclear cobalt(III) or iron(III) complexes. On the other hand, the iron(III)-catecholate complex (${\bf 3}$) activate dioxygen to undergo oxidative C–C bond cleavage of catechol. The selective formation of extradiol catechol cleavage products in the reaction of ${\bf 3}$ with dioxygen mimics the functional aspect of extradiol-cleaving catechol dioxygenases. The flexibility of ligand backbone is proposed to control the dioxygen reactivity of metal complexes.</p>

					<p>Chemistry and reactivity of dimolybdathiaborane, [(Cp$^{\ast}$Mo)$_2$B$_4$SH$_6$], ${\bf 1}$, obtained from the reaction of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, [Cp$^{\ast}$MoCl$_4$] and [LiBH$_4$.thf], has been explored with dinuclear metal carbonyl [Fe$_2$(CO)$_9$]. As a result, reaction of ${\bf 1}$ with [Fe$_2$(CO)$_9$] yielded heterometallathiaborane, [(Cp$^{\ast}$Mo)$_2$B$_4$H$_6$SFe(CO)$_3$], ${\bf 2}$ in good yield. Both the new compounds have been characterized in solution by ${}^1$H, ${}^{11}$B and ${}^{13}$C NMR spectroscopy and the structural types were unequivocally established by X-ray crystallographic analysis of compound ${\bf 2}$. Cluster ${\bf 2}$ has a bicapped octahedral geometry with the $\{$Fe(CO)$_3\}$ fragment occupying one of the high-connectivity cluster vertexes rather than a capping position. Interestingly, cluster ${\bf 1}$ undergoes geometric changes (bicapped trigonal bipyramid $\to$ bicapped octahedron) on the addition of two-electron $\{$Fe(CO)$_3\}$ fragment to ${\bf 1}$.</p>

				<title>Identification and characterization of intermediates in the formation of the cyclobutadiene linked dimeric cobalt sandwich compound [($\eta^5$-RCp)Co($\eta^4$-C$_4$Ph$_3$)]$_2$ [R = H, CH$_3$C(O)O]</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The synthesis of novel cyclobutadiene linked dimers of [$\eta^5$-RCp]Co($\eta^4$-C$_4$Ph$_4$) was reported recently from a three-component reaction of 1,4-diphenylbutadiyne, diphenylacetylene and [$\eta^5$-RCp]Co(PPh$_3$)$_2$ [R = H or MeOC(O)]. The chiral $bis$ oxazoline derivative of this dimer was found to form cobalt oxazolinyl palladacycles which were excellent chiral catalysts for the Overman–Claisen rearrangement of trichloroacetimidates, similar to the well-known COP catalysts. In this paper, we report reactions carried out for identifying the intermediates in the formation of the dimeric sandwich compound $\{$[$\eta^5$-MeOC(O)Cp]Co($\eta^4$-C$_4$Ph$_3$)$\}_2$ (${\bf 1}$). On varying the stoichiometric ratio of the reactants of the three component reaction, two new cobalt sandwich compounds [$\eta^5$-MeOC(O)Cp]Co[$\eta^4$-C$_4$Ph$_3$(C$\equiv$CPh)] (${\bf 2}$) and [$\eta^5$-MeOC(O)Cp]Co[$\eta^4$-C$_4$-Ph$_2$(C$\equiv$CPh)$_2$] (${\bf 3}$) were found to form as viscous oily liquids. The identity of ${\bf 2}$ was ascertained by oxidizing its alkyne moiety to yield crystalline [$\eta^5$-MeOC(O)Cp]Co$\{\eta^4$-C$_4$Ph$_3$[C(O)-C(O)Ph]$\}$ (${\bf 4}$) which was structurally characterized. Further, the role of phenylethynyl derived monomeric sandwich compound ${\bf 2}$ as a precursor to the dimeric compound ${\bf 1}$ was established by reacting ${\bf 2}$ with diphenylacetylene and CpCo(COD) which yielded the first example of an unsymmetrical cyclobutadiene linked dimeric cobalt sandwich compound $\{\eta^5$-[MeOC(O)Cp]Co($\eta^4$-C$_4$Ph$_3$)$\}$[($\eta^5$-Cp)Co($\eta^4$-C$_4$Ph$_3$)] (${\bf 5}$) which was also structurally characterized.</p>

					<p>The reactions of cyclodiphosphazanes, $cis$-[(${}^t$BuN-$\mu$)$_2$(PNC$_4$H$_8$O)$_2$] (${\bf 1}$, R = NC$_4$H$_8$O; ${\bf 2}$, R = NC$_4$H$_8$NMe ) (${\bf 2}$) with [$\{$RhCl(COD)$\}_2$] and [$\{$RhCl(CO)$_2\}_2$] are described. The reactions of ${\bf 1}$ or ${\bf 2}$ with [$\{$RhCl(COD)$\}_2$] in 2:1 molar ratio yielded the mononuclear complexes [(COD)RhCl$\{$($\mu$-N$^t$BuP)$_2$(NC$_4$H$_8$X)$_2\}$] (${\bf 3}$, X = O; ${\bf 4}$, X = NMe) in good yield. Treatment of one equivalent of [$\{$RhCl(CO)$_2\}_2$] with four equivalents of ${\bf 1}$ or ${\bf 2}$ produced the $trans$-[(CO)RhCl$\{$($\mu$-N$^t$BuP)$_2$(NC$_4$H$_8$X)$_2\}_2$] (${\bf 5}$, X = O; ${\bf 6}$, X = NMe) complexes as pale yellow solids. On changing the molar ratio of [$\{$RhCl(CO)$_2\}_2$] and ${\ bf 1}$ or ${\bf 2}$ from 1:4 to 1:1 resulted in the formation of tetranuclear complexes [$\{$(CO)Rh($\mu$-Cl)($\mu$-N$^t$BuP)(NC$_4$H$_8$X)$\}_4$] (${\bf 7}$, X = O; ${\bf 8}$, X = NMe) under similar reaction conditions. The tetranuclear rhodium(I) complex ${\bf 8}$ upon stirring with wet acetonitrile or in the presence of four equivalents of water at room temperature afforded a novel hydroxo bridged zwitterionic dirhodium(I) complex [$\{$(ClRh(CO))$_2$($\mu$-OH)(MeNC$_4$H$_8$N)($\mu$-N$^t$BuP)$_2$(NC$_4$H$_8$NHMe)$\}$] (${\bf 9}$).

				<abstract>
					<p>Palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) of uniform size in the range of 3–5 nm are prepared in MeOH and MeCN:MeOH by solvent-assisted reduction of palladium acetate in the presence of a hexaazamacrocyclic ligand, ${\bf L1}$. For the mixed solvent system different ratio of the solvents was tried i.e., 1:1, 1:3 and 3:1. In all cases the concentration and ratio of Pd(II) to ${\bf L1}$ was maintained at 2mM:1mM. In another experiment NPs were prepared in MeOH by lowering the concentration of ${\bf L1}$ to 0.5mM, where chain-like assemblies of PdNPs was observed. Importantly, the solutions are found to be stable at RT for months.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A two-fold interpenetrated microporous bi-pillared-layer framework of Fe(II), $\{$[Fe(2,6-napdc)(4,4'-bipy)](EtOH)(H$_2$O)$\}_n$ (${\bf 1}$) (2,6-napdc =2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate; 4,4'-bipy=4,4'-bipyridine) composed of mixed ligand system has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The 2,6-napdc linkers form a 2D corrugated sheet of $\{$Fe(2,6-napdc)$\}_n$ by linking the secondary building unit of Fe$_2$(CO$_2$)$_2$ in the $ac$ plane, which are further connected by double 4,4'-bipy pillars resulting in a bi-pillared-layer type 3D framework. The 3D framework is two-fold interpenetrated and exhibits a 3D channel structure ($4.0 \times 3.5, 1.5 \times  0.5$ and $2.2  \times  2.1$ &#197;$^2$) occupied by the guest water and ethanol molecules. Framework ${\bf 1}$ shows high thermal stability, and the desolvated framework (${\bf 1'}$) renders permanent porosity realized by N$_2$ adsorption profile at 77K (BET surface area of $\tilde 52$ m$^2$ g$^{−1}$). Moreover, the framework ${\bf 1'}$ also uptakes different solvent vapours (water, methanol and ethanol) and their type-I profile suggest strong interaction with pore surfaces and overall hydrophilic nature of the framework. Temperature dependent magnetic measurements suggest overall antiferromagnetic behaviour in compound ${\bf 1}$.</p>

				<title>$\piu$-Stacking interactions between G-quartets and circulenes: A computational study</title>
				<feature>Special issue to commemorate the International Year of Chemistry 2011</feature>
				<page>0891-0900</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Structures of planar and bowl-shaped circulenes as well as their stacks with G-quartet (G4) have been investigated through dispersion-corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT-D). The binding energies are substantial $\tilde ∼$10 kcal/mol with d $\tilde$3.5 &#197; between the stacking rings. The calculations show that G4 binds much more effectively to planar circulenes as compared to bowl shaped molecules. The strength of binding between a G-quartet and a non-planar circulene molecule depends on the orientation of the circulene (concave or convex) with respect to G-quartet. An AIM analysis of the M05-2X wave-functions has also been performed to confirm the presence of weak intermolecular interactions between guanine quartets and circulenes. Apart from $\pi$-stacking interactions, the concave bowl-shaped circulenes also interact with G4 through C-H$\cdots \pi$ interactions. The charge transport properties between the two moieties have also been analysed through effective transport integral. The calculations provide an understanding for the basis of molecular recognition by G4 for non-planar systems.</p>

				<title>Silica nanodisks as platforms for fluorescence lifetime-based sensing of pH</title>
				<feature>Special issue to commemorate the International Year of Chemistry 2011</feature>
				<page>0901-0907</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Core–shell conjugates of silica nanodisks and fluorescent dyes have been prepared. Rhodamine B, the reference, has been attached to the core, by surface functionalization of the pristine SNDs. Then, a layer of silica has been deposited on the composite nanodisks. Finally, the surface has been functionalized with fluorescein in one case and protoporphyrin IX in the other. These dyes exhibit pH-dependent fluorescence properties. The nanoconjugates are found to sense the pH of the medium, through systematic variation of the fluorescence intensity ratios of the reporter dye at the surface and the reference dye at the core. Moreover, the fluorescence lifetimes and corresponding amplitudes of the reporter dyes have been found to be reliable parameters for assessing the pH of the medium, even though the variation in lifetimes of fluorescein is rather small. In case of protoporphyrin, however, this variation is significantly large. Besides, the change in amplitudes is prominent in acidic as well as alkaline solutions. The temporal parameters can thus be used to ascertain the pH of the medium, when used in conjunction with each other.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Peripheral functionalization of PAMAM dendrimers with naphthalene units leads to significant ground state aggregation in the system above the critical aggregation concentrations (CAC). Upon photoexcitation of the ground state aggregates, static type excimer formation of naphthalene moiety is observed. Significant red-shifted emission from naphthalene excimers is achieved through generating the static type excimers in polar solvents such as methanol and acetonitrile-water mixtures. Control experiments suggest that the presence of dendritic scaffold in the system play a pivotal role in generating intense static excimer emission in naphthalene modified PAMAM dendrimers, in solution phase at room temperature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An intramolecular, alkyne Prins type cyclization of vinylogous carbonates derived from $o$-alkynyl phenols is developed for the stereoselective construction of $trans$-2,3-disubstituted dihydrobenzofuran derivatives. Strong Lewis acids like TMSOTf catalyse this reaction efficiently. The presence of mildly electron donating groups on aryl rings increases the efficiency of the reaction.</p>

				<title>Comparative self-assembly studies and self-sorting of two structurally isomeric naphthalene-diimide (NDI)-gelators</title>
				<feature>Special issue to commemorate the International Year of Chemistry 2011</feature>
				<page>0963-0973</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have reported here a comparative self-assembly and gelation studies of two isomeric bis-amide functionalized NDI-derivatives. In one case ($\textbf{NDI-1}$) the two amide groups were placed symmetrically on either side of the chromophore while for the other system ($\textbf{NDI-2}$) they were located on same side. In non-polar solvent both isomers formed self-assembled structures by synergistic effect of $\pi$-stacking and hydrogen-bonding. The propensity for self-assembly of $\textbf{NDI-1}$ was greater due to symmetrical placement of two amide groups on either arms of this chromophore which allowed $\pi$-stacking in tandem with hydrogen-bonding, while $\textbf{NDI-2}$ formed thermally more stable self-assembled fibres possibly due to location of two amide groups in close proximity along single arm of this chromophore. The structural difference in these two isomers lead to distinctly different morphology of their respective self-assembled structures which was further reflected on their gelation properties. Morphology of the self-assembled array of $\textbf{NDI-1}$ showed organized and regular entangled bundles of nanorods which imparted better gelation ability to this chromophore while the self-assembled fibres of $\textbf{NDI-2}$ showed less ordered and irregular fibres. We also probed self- assembly of these two chromophores in their mixture which revealed orthogonal assembly of the individual chromophores and no molecular mixing was noticed.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0013-0019</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The quantum dynamics of intramolecular H-atom transfer in malonaldehyde is investigated with a model two-dimensional Hamiltonian constructed with the help of available $\textit{ab initio}$ theoretical data on the relevant portion of the potential energy surface. At zero temperature, the H-atom transfer takes place by tunnelling leading to $\textit{cis-cis}$ isomerization while the $\textit{cis-trans}$ channel remains closed. Local excitation of the $\textit{cis-trans}$ mode by an external field is predicted to quench $\textit{cis-cis}$ tunnelling isomerization while excitation of the $\textit{cis-cis}$ mode is found to enhance the isomerization by tunnelling.</p>

					<p>A Brownian particle in a confined space with varying cross-section, experiences an effective entropic potential in reduced dimension. We modulate the shape of the confinement and examine the nature of dynamical transition between two distinct thermalized entropic states corresponding to different shapes of the enclosure, using Jarzynski relation on the basis of work-distribution over non-equilibrium paths. Our analysis reveals that modulating the shape of the boundaries of the enclosure makes the resident Brownian particles feel an entropic phase transition.</p>

					<p>The chemical reactivity descriptors, such as electronegativity, hardness and electrophilicity of major oxides computed from density functional theory are reported in this paper. These parameters are plotted within a fitness landscape diagram, showing that the principles of minimum electrophilicity (MEP) and maximum hardness (MHP) act as guides towards the region of higher stability. The diagrams indicate the trends and the parameters that control the evolution of natural rocks. Application of the principle S-bearing copper compounds shows the possible and preferred combinations of elements, that give rise to compounds observed during ore formation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Application of quantum chemical calculations is vital in understanding hydrogen bonding observed in formamide clusters, a prototype model for motifs found in protein secondary structure. DFT calculations have been performed on four arrangements of formamide clusters [HCONH$_2$]$_n$, ($n = 1 − 10$) linear, circular, helical and stacked forms. These studies reveal the maximum cooperativity in the stacked arrangement followed by the circular, helical and linear arrangements and is based on interaction energy per monomer. In all these arrangements as we increase cluster size, an increasing trend in cooperativity of hydrogen bonding is observed. Atoms-in-molecule analysis establishes the nature of bonding between the formamide monomers on the basis of electron density values obtained at the bond critical point (BCP).</p>

				<title>Use of an intense microwave laser to dissociate a diatomic molecule: Theoretical prediction of dissociation dynamics</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0043-0050</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By employing an intense microwave laser of wavelength 116.65 $\mu$m with intensities $1 \times 10^{13}$ and $5 \times  10^{18}$Wcm$^{−2}$, respectively, the conclusion is reached theoretically and computationally that it is possible to dissociate the CO molecule, modelled as a Morse oscillator. It is predicted that for above-threshold dissociation (ATD), the molecule should absorb 1044 photons of the given wavelength in order to reach the lowest edge of the vibrational continuum. A consistent analysis of the predicted dissociation process is provided though the time-dependent probability density, dissociation probability, norm, potential function, HHG and ATD spectra, obtained by numerically solving the time-dependent vibrational Schödinger equation.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0051-0058</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have performed a nuclear dynamics simulation to calculate photoelectron spectra and population profiles of benzene radical cation (C$_6$H$^+_6$) employing the parallelized Time Dependent Discrete Variable Representation (TDDVR) approach. For this purpose, we have considered $\textit{two}$ multi-state multi-mode model Hamiltonians of C$_6$H$^+_6$ with degeneracy among the electronic states: (a) One consists of three states and eight modes, which in turn leads to a $\textit{five state thirteen mode Hamiltonian}$ ($X^2$E$_{1g}$-$B^2$E$_{2g}$-$C^2$A$_{2u}$) due to the degeneracy; and (b) The other is constituted of three states and thirteen modes which is basically a $\textit{five state twenty mode Hamiltonian}$ ($B^2$E$_{2g}$-$D^2$E$_{1u}$-$E^2$B$_{2u}$) for the same reason. Since these electronic states are interconnected by several conical intersections in the vicinity of the Franck Condon region, it will be $\textit{challenging}$ to pursue such large dynamical calculation in the presence of nonadiabaticity among the electronic states. The spectral as well as population profiles calculated with the advent of TDDVR approach show reasonably good agreement with the results obtained by the Multi Configuration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) methodology.</p>

					<p>Tyrosine is an important amino acid residue that plays a key role in several biochemical transformations such as, abstraction/donation of proton from/by its sidechain. We present here a density functional study on the proton affinity of tyrosine sidechain suspended inside the core of a single walled carbon nanotube that mimics the environment of protein structural pores and molecular channels. Tyrosine is found to exhibit a lower reactivity on confinement and unlike several other polar amino acid sidechains, its reactivity does not respond to hydrogen bonding with neighbouring hydroxyl groups.</p>

				<title>Dynamics of atomic clusters in intense optical fields of ultrashort duration</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0075-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Intense laser pulses have been generated that last for only 10 fs, long enough to accommodate only 3 optical cycles of 800 nm light. Upon focussing such pulses, intensities in the 10$^{15}$ W cm$^{−2}$ range are readily generated. At such intensities, the magnitude of the optical field begins to match intra-atomic Coulombic fields. Consequently, exposure of atoms and molecules to such intense pulses inevitably leads to single and multiple ionization. We report here results of experiments that we have conducted that involve irradiation of gas-phase Ar15,000 clusters by such intense, few-cycle laser pulses. The clusters become multiply ionized and undergo Coulomb explosion, giving rise to ejection of fast Ar-ions. Results show that the strong-field dynamics in the few-cycle domain differ significantly from those that occur in the longer pulse (&gt; 30 fs) regime. Manifestations of these differences are presented in the form of angle-dependent ion energy and ion yield functions.</p>

				<title>$\textit{Bhageerath}$—Targeting the near impossible: Pushing the frontiers of atomic models for protein tertiary structure prediction</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0083-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein folding, considered to be the holy grail of molecular biology, remains intractable even after six decades since the report of the first crystal structure. Over 70,000 X-ray and NMR structures are now available in protein structural repositories and no physico-chemical solution is in sight. Molecular simulation methodologies have evolved to a stage to provide a computational solution to the tertiary structures of small proteins. Knowledge base driven methodologies are maturing in predicting the tertiary structures of query sequences which share high similarities with sequences of known structures in the databases. The void region thus seems to be medium (&gt; 100 amino acid residues) to large proteins with no sequence homologs in the databases and hence which has become a fertile ground for the genesis of hybrid models which exploit local similarities together with $\textit{ab initio}$ models to arrive at reasonable predictions.We describe here the development of $\textit{Bhageerath}$ an $\textit{ab initio}$ model and $\textit{Bhageerath}$-H a hybrid model and present a critique on the current status of prediction of protein tertiary structures.</p>

					<p>Quantum dynamics of superelastic collisions involving vibrational levels of MgH$^+$(X$^1$$\sum^+$) ions in cold traps, interacting with ${}^4$He(${}^1$S) as a buffer gas at relative temperatures down to millikelvins, is discussed using an ab initio computed potential energy surface. The relative efficiency of collisional cooling with respect to collisional quenching of the internal vibrations is examined from the results of the relative sizes of the relevant cross sections in relation to predicting actual behaviour in cold traps. The present study indicates the feasibility of cooling vibrationally `hot’, trapped ions with the buffer gas.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Pericyclic reactions in the electronic ground state may be initiated by down-chirped pump-dump sub-pulses of an optimal laser pulse, in the ultraviolet (UV) frequency and sub-10 femtosecond (fs) time domain. This is demonstrated by means of a quantum dynamics model simulation of the Cope rearrangement of Semibullvalene. The laser pulse is designed by means of optimal control theory, with detailed analysis of the mechanism. The theoretical results support the recent experimental initiation of a pericyclic reaction. The present approach provides an important step towards monitoring asynchronous electronic fluxes during synchronous nuclear pericyclic reaction dynamics, with femto-to-attosecond time resolution, as motivated by the recent prediction of our group.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Laser-induced fluorescence spectra of a 2:1 complex between 7-azaindole and water, known as `non-reactive dimer’ of the molecule, have been measured in a supersonic jet expansion. The dispersed fluorescence spectrum of the electronic origin band of the complex shows a very large number of low-frequency vibrational features corresponding to different intermolecular modes of the complex in the ground electronic state. Geometries of several possible isomeric structures of the complex and their vibrational frequencies at harmonic approximation were calculated by electronic structure theory method at MP2/6-31G$^{\ast\ast}$ level. An excellent agreement is observed between the measured and calculated intermolecular vibrational mode frequencies for the energetically most favoured structure of the complex, where the water molecule is inserted within one of the two N$\cdots$H–N hydrogen bonds of the 7AI dimer.</p>

					<p>Vibrational excitation cross-sections $\sigma_{v_f \leftarrow v_i}$($E$) in resonant e-F$_2$ and HCl scattering are calculated from transition matrix elements $T_{ν_f \leftarrow v_i}$($E$) obtained using Fourier transform of the cross correlation function $\langle \phi_{v_f} (R) | \Phi_{v_i} (R, t) \rangle$. where $\Psi_{v_i} (R,t) \approx e^{i \hbar H_{AB^-}(R)t} \phi_{v_i} (R)$. Time evolution under the influence of the resonance anionic Hamiltonian H$_{AB^-}$ (AB=F$_2$/HCl) is effected using Lanczos reduction technique followed by fast Fourier transform and the target (AB) vibrational eigenfunctions $\phi_{ν_i}$ ($R$) and $\phi_{v_f}$ ($R$) are calculated using Fourier grid Hamiltonian method applied to potential energy (PE) curve of the neutral target. The resulting vibrational excitation cross-sections provide reasonable agreement with experimental and other theoretical results.</p>

				<title>Tailoring approach for obtaining molecular orbitals of large systems</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0149-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular orbitals (MO’s) within Hartree-Fock (HF) theory are of vital importance as they provide preliminary information of bonding and features such as electron localization and chemical reactivity. The contemporary literature treats the Kohn–Sham orbitals within density functional theory (DFT) equivalently to the MO's obtained within HF framework. The high scaling order of $\textit{ab initio}$ methods is the main hurdle in obtaining the MO's for large molecular systems. With this view, an attempt is made in the present work to employ molecular tailoring approach (MTA) for obtaining the complete set of MO's including occupied and virtual orbitals, for large molecules at HF and B3LYP levels of theory. The energies of highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, and hence the band gaps, are accurately estimated by MTA for most of the test cases benchmarked in this study, which include $\pi$-conjugated molecules. Typically, the root mean square errors of valence MO's are in range of 0.001 to 0.010 a.u. for all the test cases examined. MTA shows a time advantage factor of 2 to 3 over the corresponding actual calculation, for many of the systems reported.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0167-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Imidozirconocene complex is known for its bifunctional reactivity and catalytic ability and this complex mediates ring cleavage of epoxides. Cyclooctene oxide (${\bf 1}$) Norbornene oxide (${\bf 2}$) and 2,5-dimethyl cyclohexene oxide (${\bf 3}$) undergo ring cleavage in the presence of imidozirconocene complex. Epoxide ${\bf 1}$ has accessible $\beta$-hydrogens (type I) while epoxide ${\bf 2}$ and ${\bf 3}$ do not have them (type II). Normally type I epoxides undergo elimination while type II epoxides prefer insertion. All the insertion reactions lead to five-membered metallacycle formation and elimination results in thermodynamically stable allyl-alkoxy product. The insertion is a two-step process following either diradical or zwitterionic pathway, while elimination is a one-step concerted reaction. DFT (density functional theory) modelling of these reactions at B3LYP/LANL2DZ level show that epoxide ${\bf 1}$ undergoes elimination in agreement with experiment. However, calculations indicate that epoxide (${\bf 2}$) proceeds through diradical intermediate in contrast to experimental observations. Surprisingly, epoxide (${\bf 3}$) that has both the $\beta$ positions blocked by methyl groups undergoes elimination rather than insertion. AIM and EDA analyses offer further insights on the reaction mechanism and bifunctional reactivity of imidozirconozene complex.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0177-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>When a light beam passes through any medium, the effects of interaction of light with the material depend on the field intensity. At low light intensities the response of materials remain linear to the amplitude of the applied electromagnetic field. But for sufficiently high intensities, the optical properties of materials are no longer linear to the amplitude of applied electromagnetic field. In such cases, the interaction of light waves with matter can result in the generation of new frequencies due to nonlinear processes such as higher harmonic generation and mixing of incident fields. One such nonlinear process, namely, the third order nonlinear spectroscopy has become a popular tool to study molecular structure. Thus, the spectroscopy based on the third order optical nonlinearity called stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SRS) is a tool to extract the structural and dynamical information about a molecular system. Ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopy (URLS) is analogous to SRS but is more sensitive than SRS. In this paper, we present the theoretical basis of SRS (URLS) techniques which have been developed in our laboratory.</p>

					<p>The simple connection between the Slater orbitals, venerable in quantum chemistry, and the Coulomb Sturmian orbitals, more recently employed in atomic and molecular physics, is pointed out explicitly in view of the renewed interest in both as basis sets in applied quantum mechanics. Research in Slater orbitals mainly concerns multicentre, many-body integrals, whereas that on Sturmians exploits their orthonormality and completeness with no need of continuum states. An account of recent progress is outlined, also with reference to relationships between the two basis sets, and with the momentum space and hyperspherical harmonics representations.</p>

				<title>The role of C–H$\ldots \pi$ interaction in the stabilization of benzene and adamantane clusters</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0193-0202</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this investigation, a systematic attempt has been made to understand the interaction between adamantane and benzene using both ab initio and density functional theory methods. C–H$\ldots \pi$ type of interaction between C–H groups of adamantane and $\pi$ cloud of benzene is found as the important attraction for complex formation. The study also reveals that the methylene (-CH$_2$) and methine (-CH) groups of adamantane interact with benzene resulting in different geometrical structures. And it is found that the former complex is stronger than the later. The diamondoid structure of adamantane enables it to interact with a maximum of four benzene molecules, each one along the four faces. The stability of the complex increases with increase in the number of benzene molecules. The energy decomposition analysis of adamantane-benzene complexes using DMA approach shows that the origin of the stability primarily arises from the dispersive interaction. The theory of atoms in molecules (AIM) supports the existence of weak interaction between the two systems. The electrostatic topography features provide clues for the mode of interaction of adamantane with benzene.</p>

				<title>Density functional studies of endosulphan and its interaction with glycine and GABA</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0203-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theoretic (DFT) methods are employed to study the interactions between endosulphan and two amino acids, namely glycine and $\gamma$ -aminobutyric acid (GABA). Two conformers of each isomer $\alpha$- and $\beta$-endosulphan are considered in the study. The DFT methods B3LYP, M05, M05–2X, M06 and M06–2X in conjunction with the basis set 6–31++G$^{\ast\ast}$ are used. The complexes of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-endosulphan with amino acids are stabilized by a strong hydrogen bond. In addition, there are several weak C–H$\ldots$O interactions present between the two moieties. Among the DFT methods used, M06–2X method shows the highest stabilization energy for all the complexes. The M06–2X/6–31++G$^{\ast\ast}$ method predicts that among the four conformers of endosulphan, the $\alpha$ conformer in which the S=O points up, forms the most stable complex with both glycine and GABA, with stabilization energies −15.24 kcal/mol and −14.39 kcal/mol, respectively. The $\beta$ conformer in which the S=O points down, forms the least stable complex with both amino acids with stabilization energies −7.14 and −7.85 kcal/mol, respectively.</p>

				<title>Variation of kinetic isotope effect in multiple proton transfer reactions</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0209-0214</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recently, we had suggested that the motion along the promoter mode in the first part of the IRC of proton transfer reaction enhances the delocalization of $n_\sigma$ electrons on the acceptor atom into the $\sigma^\ast$ orbital of the donor-hydrogen covalent bond, and as a consequence weakens it. This leads to a reduction of the barrier to the proton transfer as well as the stretching frequency of donor-hydrogen bond. An extension of this to the concerted multiple proton transfer reactions implies that the kinetic isotope effect in such reaction depends exponentially on the number of protons that are being transferred. Computational evidence on three systems, (HF)$_3$, formic acid dimer, and (H$_2$O)$_n$ clusters is provided to support this assertion.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0215-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present an $\textit{ab initio}$ molecular dynamics study of vibrational spectral diffusion and hydrogen bond dynamics in aqueous solution of acetone at room temperature. It is found that the frequencies of OD bonds in the acetone hydration shell have a higher stretch frequency than those in the bulk water. Also, on average, the frequencies of hydration shell OD modes are found to increase with increase in the acetone–water hydrogen bond distance. The vibrational spectral diffusion of the hydration shell water molecules reveals three time scales: A short-time relaxation ($\tilde$80 fs) corresponding to the dynamics of intact acetone–water hydrogen bonds, a slower relaxation ($\tilde$1.3 ps) corresponding to the lifetime of acetone–water hydrogen bonds and another longer time constant ($\tilde$12 ps) corresponding to the escape dynamics of water from the solute hydration shell. The present first principles results are compared with those of available experiments and classical simulations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Dipole moment calculations of SF and ClO radicals have been carried out using the recently developed partial triples correction to Fock-space multi-reference coupled cluster method. Theoretical calculation of the doublet SF and ClO radicals is useful due to their importance in atmospheric chemistry. The dipole moments of these radicals are extremely sensitive to correlation effects. A brief insight to the way the triples correction has been implemented is presented. We compare the results obtained from our analytic response treatment with that of restricted open Hartree-Fock (ROHF) calculations. Results are presented for both relaxed and non-relaxed approach in the ROHF method. Results suggest the importance of triples corrections. The effects of orbital relaxation are also analysed from the results.</p>

				<title>Excitation energy transfer from dye molecules to doped graphene</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0233-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recently, we have reported theoretical studies on the rate of energy transfer from an electronically excited molecule to graphene. It was found that graphene is a very efficient quencher of the electronically excited states and that the rate $\alpha z^{−4}$. The process was found to be effective up to 30 $nm$ which is well beyond the traditional FRET limit. In this report, we study the transfer of an amount of energy $\hbar \Omega$ from a dye molecule to doped graphene. We find a crossover of the distance dependence of the rate from $z^{−4}$ to exponential as the Fermi level is increasingly shifted into the conduction band, with the crossover occurring at a shift of the Fermi level by an amount $\hbar \Omega/2$.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using dimensional analyses, the scaling properties of the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship as well as the various information theoretical uncertainty-like relationships are derived for the bound states corresponding to the superposition of the power potential of the form $V(r) = Zr^n + \sum_i Z_ir^{n_i}$, where $Z$, $Zi$, $n$, $n_i$ are parameters, in the free state as well as in the additional presence of a spherical penetrable boundary wall located at radius $R$ The uncertainty product and all other net information measures are shown here to depend only on the parameters [$s_i$] defined by the ratios $Z_i/Z^{(n_i+2)/(n+2)}$. Introduction of a finite potential, $V_c$ at the radial distance $r \geq R$ results in a complete set of scaling parameters given by [$s_i$, $t_1$, $t_2$], where $t_1$ is given by $RZ^{1/(n+2)}$ and $t_2 = V_c/(Z)^{2/(n+2)}$.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0247-0253</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The first three photoelectron bands of 2-phenylethyl-$\textit{N,N}$-dimethylamine (PENNA) are investigated theoretically, paying particular attention to the vibrational structure and to possible nonadiabatic coupling effects. A substantial vibronic interaction is established between the first and second excited cationic states (corresponding to the second and third photoelectron bands). Their coupling to the cationic ground state is found to be rather weak. This is tentatively attributed to the well-known fact that the latter carries a hole at the amine site, while the former two have the electron removed from benzene-type orbitals. The interaction between the two excited cationic states is characterized by a `hidden’ or local symmetry at the phenyl moiety. Preliminary dynamic calculations with two interacting electronic states and four vibrational modes are reported. The computed spectra are compared to experimental results of Weinkauf $\textit{et al}$.</p>

				<page>0255-0260</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Theoretical studies on hydrogen adsorption properties of silicon-lithium binary clusters are carried out. We have considered three different clusters viz., Si$_5$Li$^{−5}$, Si$_5$Li$^{6}$ and Si$_5$Li$^+_7$ and for each cluster, the geometries of different possible isomers are optimized. In all the minimum energy isomers of the three clusters considered, two of the lithium atoms are found to be situated in the axial positions and the remaining lithium atoms are in the equatorial position in the Si$_5$ plane. The lithium atoms which are in Si$_5$ plane are bonded to the Si-Si edge through a bridged bond instead of a corner in the Si5 ring. From the calculated atomic charges, it is found that there is a charge transfer from lithium to silicon leaving a partial positive charge on the Li atoms and the axial lithium atoms are more charged as compared to the remaining lithium atoms. In the case of Si$_5$Li$_6$ and Si$_5$Li$^+_7$, the Li sites can trap a total of 14 and 17 H$_2$ molecules, respectively, with each bridge bonded Li site adsorbing three H$_2$ molecules and each axial Li adsorbing one H$_2$ molecule which corresponds to a gravimetric density of 13.33 wt&#37; and 15.25 wt&#37;, respectively.</p>

				<title>Structure and transport properties of LiF–BeF$_2$ mixtures: Comparison of rigid and polarizable ion potentials</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0261-0269</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the structure and dynamics of the LiF–BeF$_2$ system over a range of compositions using the transferable rigid-ion model (TRIM). The densities obtained with the TRIM potential are approximately 17–20&#37; lower than the experimental values while polarizable ion models (PIM) give densities within 5&#37; of the experimental value. The TRIM and PIM potentials give essentially identical radial distribution functions (RDFs) for Li–F and Be–F ion pairs though the Be–Be pair correlations differ significantly and reflect the corresponding density differences. The variation in the radial distribution functions with concentration, particularly the anion–anion pair correlation function, reflects the reorganization of the fluoride ions as the addition of BeF$_2$ in the mixture promotes the formation of the tetrahedral fluoroberyllate network. Along the 67 mol&#37; LiF isopleth, diffusivities and Nernst–Einstein ionic conductivities from simulations using the PIM and TRIM potentials are in good agreement for temperatures up to 925 K. The viscosity data using the PIM model is also found to be in good agreement with the TRIM results presented here along the 873K isotherm for compositions ranging from 0 to 50 mol&#37; BeF$_2$. The main conclusion from this study is that the non-polarizable, TRIM provides reasonable results for the structural correlations and transport properties of the LiF–BeF$_2$ system in comparison with first-principles-based, PIM.</p>

While the highest energy hydride ions formed by DEA show angular distributions characteristic to the A$_1$ symmetry, those formed with low-kinetic energy show considerably different angular distributions indicating changes in the orientation of the dissociating bond due to bending mode vibrations. Our observations are quite different from the recently reported measurements, but consistent with the fully quantum calculations.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0281-0289</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two-photon microscopy depends extensively on the two-photon absorption cross-sections of biologically relevant chromophores. High repetition rate (HRR) lasers are essential in multiphoton microscopy for generating satisfactory signal to noise at low average powers. However, HRR lasers generate thermal distortions in samples even with the slightest single photon absorption. We use an optical chopper with HRR lasers to intermittently `blank’ irradiation and effectively minimize thermal effects to result in a femtosecond z-scan setup that precisely measures the two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections of chromophores. Though several experimental factors impact such TPA measurements, a systematic effort to modulate and influence TPA characteristics is yet to evolve. Here, we present the effect of several control parameters on the TPA process that are independent of chromophore characteristics for femtosecond laser pulse based measurements; and demonstrate how the femtosecond laser pulse repetition rate, chromophore environment and incident laser polarization can become effective control parameters for such nonlinear optical properties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work an analysis of the highly vibrationally excited states of thiophosgene (SCCl$_2$) is made in order to gain insights into some of the experimental observations and spectral features. The states analysed here lie in a spectrally complex region where strong mode mixings are expected due to the overlap of several strong anharmonic Fermi resonances. Two recent techniques, a semiclassical angle space representation of the eigenstates and the parametric variation of the eigenvalues (level-velocities) are used to identify eigenstate sequences exhibiting common localization characteristics. Preliminary results on the influence of highly excited out-of-plane bending modes on the nature of the eigenstates suggest a possible bifurcation in the system.</p>

				<title>Adsorption of croconate dyes on TiO$_2$ anatase (101) surface: A periodic DFT study to understand the binding of diketo groups</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0301-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The adsorption of model croconate dyes on the stoichiometric TiO$_2$ anatase (101) surface has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations to understand the adsorption of the diketo (-COCO-) groups. Past experimental and theoretical results have shown the strong binding ability of the acid group (-COOH) to the TiO$_2$ surface but here the theoretical studies predicts the binding strength of the diketo group to be also significant and comparable with that of the -COOH group. This may cause a competitive binding between the keto groups and the acid groups on the TiO$_2$ surface in the case of croconate dyes and cause a reduction in the efficiency of the DSSC.</p>

				<title>Quantum dynamics of the Cl+H$_2$ reaction at ultracold temperatures</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0311-0316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum calculations are reported for the reaction between vibrationally excited H$_2$ molecules and Cl atoms at energies ranging from the ultracold to thermal regimes. It is found that chemical reaction leading to vibrationally excited HCl molecules dominates over non-reactive vibrational quenching. The product HCl molecule is found to be formed predominantly in the $v = 1$ vibrational level with appreciable rotational excitation. A spin-orbit uncorrected value of $1.86  \times  10^{−12}$ cm$^3$ molecule$^{−1}$ s$^{−1}$ is predicted for the rate coefficient in the zero-temperature limit, which is about two orders of magnitude larger than the thermal rate coefficient of the Cl+H$_2$ reaction at 300 K.</p>

				<title>Hydration dynamics of protein molecules in aqueous solution: Unity among diversity</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0317-0325</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dielectric dispersion and NMRD experiments have revealed that a significant fraction of water molecules in the hydration shell of various proteins do not exhibit any slowing down of dynamics. This is usually attributed to the presence of the hydrophobic residues (HBR) on the surface, although HBRs alone cannot account for the large amplitude of the fast component. Solvation dynamics experiments and also computer simulation studies, on the other hand, repeatedly observed the presence of a non-negligible slow component. Here we show, by considering three well-known proteins ($\textit{lysozyme, myoglobin}$ and $\textit{adelynate}$ kinase), that the fast component arises $\textit{partly}$ from the response of those water molecules that are hydrogen bonded with the backbone oxygen (BBO) atoms. These are structurally and energetically less stable than those with the side chain oxygen (SCO) atoms. In addition, the electrostatic interaction energy distribution (EIED) of individual water molecules (hydrogen bonded to SCO) with side chain oxygen atoms shows a $\textit{surprising}$ two $\textit{peak character}$ with the lower energy peak almost $\textit{coincident}$ with the energy distribution of water hydrogen bonded to backbone oxygen atoms (BBO). This two peak contribution appears to be quite general as we find it for lysozyme, myoglobin and adenylate kinase (ADK). $\textit{The sharp peak of EIED at small energy (at less than} 2 k_{B}T) \textit{for the BBO atoms, together with the first peak of EIED of SCO and the HBRs on the protein surface, explain why a large fraction (∼ 80&#37;) of water in the protein hydration layer remains almost as mobile as bulk water}$. Significant slowness arises only from the hydrogen bonds that populate the second peak of EIED at larger energy (at about 4 k$_B$T). Thus, if we consider hydrogen bond interaction alone, only 15–20&#37; of water molecules in the protein hydration layer can exhibit slow dynamics, resulting in an average relaxation time of about 5–10 ps. The latter estimate assumes a time constant of 20–100 ps for the slow component. Interestingly, relaxation of water molecules hydrogen bonded to back bone oxygen exhibit an initial component faster than the bulk, suggesting that hydrogen bonding of these water molecules remains frustrated. This explanation of the heterogeneous and non-exponential dynamics of water in the hydration layer is quantitatively consistent with all the available experimental results, and provides unification among diverse features.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Structure, Reactivity and Dynamics</feature>
				<page>0327-0332</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Constrained molecular dynamics is used to calculate the potentials of mean force for the $\textit{exo}$ and $\textit{endo}$ dissociation of 2-norbornyl chlorides in two solvents, namely water and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). The gas phase potential energy curves for the 2-norbornyl chlorides are computed by $\textit{ab initio}$ methods and these curves are fitted into a 12–6–1 potential for use in classical molecular dynamics simulations. The gas phase potential energy curves indicate a greater barrier for the dissociation of the $\textit{endo}$ 2-norbornyl chloride (than the $\textit{exo}$). The potentials of mean force (PMF) in DMSO and water indicate the locations and the magnitudes of the activation barriers in these solutions and are sensitive functions of the fitted gas phase potentials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have evolved to be an important family and a corner stone for research in the area of inorganic chemistry. The progress made since 2000 has attracted researchers from other disciplines to actively engage themselves in this area. This cooperative synergy of different scientific believes have provided important edge and spread to the chemistry of metal-organic frameworks. The ease of synthesis coupled with the observation of properties in the areas of catalysis, sorption, separation, luminescence, bioactivity, magnetism, etc., are a proof of this synergism. In this article, we present the recent developments in this area.</p>

				<title>Excited state intramolecular charge transfer reaction in non-aqueous reverse micelles: Effects of solvent confinement and electrolyte concentration</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0355-0373</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Steady state and time resolved fluorescence emission spectroscopy have been employed to investigate the effects of solvent confinement and electrolyte concentration on excited state intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) reaction in 4-(1-pyrrolidinyl) benzonitrile (P5C), 4-(1-piperidinyl) benzonitrile (P6C), and 4-(1-morpholenyl) benzonitrile (M6C) in AOT/n-heptane/acetonitrile and AOT/n-heptane/methanol reverse micelles. Dramatic confinement effects have been revealed via a huge reduction (factor ranging between 100 and 20) over bulk values of both equilibrium and reaction rate constants. A strong dependence on the size of the confinement ($W_s$) of these quantities has also been observed. $W_s$ dependent average static dielectric constant, viscosity and solvation time-scale have been determined. Estimated dielectric constants for confined methanol and acetonitrile show a decrease from the respective bulk values by a factor of 3–5 and viscosities increased by a factor of 2 at the highest $W_s$ considered. Addition of electrolyte at $W_s = 5$ for acetonitrile is found to produce a linear increase of confined solvent viscosity but leads to a non-monotonic electrolyte concentration dependence of average solvation time. Reaction rate constant is found to decrease linearly with electrolyte concentration for P5C and P6C but non-monotonically for M6C, the highest decrease for all the molecules being $\tilde$ 20&#37; over the value in the absence of added electrolyte in the solvent pool. The observed huge reduction in reaction rate constant is attributed to the effects of decreased solution polarity, enhanced viscosity and slowed-down solvent reorganization of the solvent under confinement in these non-aqueous reverse micelles.</p>

				<title>Formation of fractals by the self-assembly of interpolymer adducts of polymethacrylic acid with complementary polymers in aqueous solution</title>

				<page>0375-0383</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Interpolymer adducts of poly(methacrylic acid), (PMAA), with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) in presence of sodium chloride or potassium chloride form highly ordered fractal patterns in films on glass surface on drying at ambient temperature. The structure, morphology and the conditions under which the formation of fractal patterns occurs were investigated by SEM, EDX and confocal microscopic techniques. Self-organization of PMAA with complementary polymers such as poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is well-known and in the presence of sodium chloride formation of the fractals in films of the adducts is a novel observation. Fractal formation occurs due to the aggregation of interpolymer adducts. The composition of the fractals in the film is studied by EDX and confocal microscopic images of the fluorophores covalently bound to PMAA. In presence of salts, sodium chloride or potassium chloride, micellar like entities of 80 nm size were formed which further aggregate to form fractal patterns. It is suggested that the fractals result from the interpolymer adduct by Diffusion Limited Aggregation mechanism.</p>

					<p>Transition metal oxide (TiO$_2$, Fe$_2$O$_3$, CoO) loaded MCM-41 and MCM-48 were synthesized by a two-step surfactant-based process. Nanoporous, high surface area compounds were obtained after calcination of the compounds. The catalysts were characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, UV-vis and BET surface area analysis. The catalysts showed high activity for the photocatalytic degradation of both anionic and cationic dyes. The degradation of the dyes was described using Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics and the associated rate parameters were determined.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0403-0410</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, crystal structure, thermal characterization, FTIR and Raman measurements are given for a new mixed compound cesium–ammonium tellurate. X-ray study showed that the [Cs$_{0.92}$(NH$_4$)$_{0.08}$]$_2$TeCl$_4$Br$_2$ compound crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4/mnc, with a = 7.452 (1) &#197;, c = 10.544 (3) &#197; and Z = 2. The refinement converged at room temperature to $R_p = 0.093$ and $R_{wp} = 0.076$. The structure is considered as isolated octahedral TeCl$_4$Br$^{2−}_2$. These anions show a 4$^\circ$ rotation around the fourfold axis against the cubic arrangement of the K$_2$PtCI$_6$ type structure. The monovalent cations (Cs$^+$/NH$^+_4$) are located between the octahedra ensuring the stability of the structure by ionic and hydrogen bonding contacts: Cs$\ldots$Cl/Br and N-H$\ldots\ldots$Cl/Br. A DTA/TGA experiment at high temperature reveals one endothermic peak at 780K for this compound. At low temperature a transition from phase I to phase II was detected at 213K by DSC. This transition, confirmed by Raman analysis, can be attributed to an order–disorder phase transition.</p>

				<title>Mechanistic aspects of Os(VIII) catalysed oxidation of loop diuretic drug furosemide by Ag(III) periodate complex in aqueous alkaline medium</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0421-0430</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of oxidation of a loop diuretic drug furosemide (Fur) by diperiodatoargentate(III) (DPA) has been investigated in the presence of osmium(VIII) (Os(VIII)) used as homogeneous catalyst in alkaline medium at a constant ionic strength of 0.20mol dm$^{−3}$ spectrophotometrically attached with HI-TECH SFA-12 stopped flow accessory. The stoichiometry was 1:2 (Fur:DPA). The order of the reaction with respect to [DPA] was unity while the order with respect to [Fur] was less than unity over the concentration range studied. The rate increased with an increase in [OH−] and decreased with an increase in [IO$^−_4$]. The order with respect to [Os(VIII)] was unity. The oxidation products were identified as 2-(4-carboxy-2-oxo-but-3-enylamino)-4-chloro-5-sulfamoyl-benzoic acid and Ag(I). A suitable mechanism was proposed. The reaction constants involved in the different steps of the reaction mechanism were calculated. Kinetic experiments suggest that [Ag(H$_2$IO$_6$)(H$_2$O)$_2$] is the reactive silver(III) species and [OsO$_4$(OH)$_2$]$^{2−}$ is the reactive Os(VIII) species.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0437-0449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of novel ammonium derivatives were synthesized and examined for their antimicrobial efficacy. Comparison of antimicrobial spectrum revealed that compounds ${\bf 9}$, ${\bf 11}$, ${\bf 16}$ and ${\bf 23}$ had strong potential against pathogens $\textit{in vitro}. Cytotoxicity results showed compound ${\bf 9}$ to be least toxic, it is non-toxic to A549 and U87 cells in MTT assay and exhibits marginal toxicity (15–20&#37;) to human erythrocytes at a concentration of 1000 $\mu$g/ml as compared to 100&#37; lysis of cells by 31.25 $\mu$g/ml of the standard drug amphotericin B. This compound has MIC values in the range of 1.95–31.25 $\mu$g/disc in DDA against different pathogens and may considered to be an important lead antimicrobial molecule for further exploration.</p>
