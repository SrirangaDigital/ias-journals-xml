				<title>Cobalt(III), nickel(II) and ruthenium(II) complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline family of ligands: DNA binding and photocleavage studies</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>DNA binding and photocleavage characteristics of a series of mixedligand complexes of the type [M(phen)2LL]$^{n+}$ (where M = Co(III), Ni(II) or Ru(II), LL = 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), phenanthroline-dione (phen-dione) or dipyridophenazine (dppz) and  $n = 3$ or 2) have been investigated in detail. Various physico-chemical and biochemical techniques including UV/Visible, fluorescence and viscometric titration, thermal denaturation, and differential pulse voltammetry have been employed to probe the details of DNA binding by these complexes; intrinsic binding constants (Kb) have been estimated under a similar set of experimental conditions. Analysis of the results suggests that intercalative ability of the coordinated ligands varies as dppz $&gt;$ phen $&lt;$ phen-dione in this series of complexes. While the Co(II) and Ru(II) complexes investigated in this study effect photocleavage of the supercoiled pBR 322 DNA, the corresponding Ni(II) complexes are found to be inactive under similar experimental conditions. Results of detailed investigations carried out inquiring into the mechanistic aspects of DNA photocleavage by [Co(phen)2 (dppz)]$^{3+}$ have also been reported. </p>

				<title>Improved technology for manufacture of carbon electrodes</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0019-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Current industrial carbon electrodes are typically manufactured by blending petroleum coke particles (the filler) with molten coal tar pitch (the binder) and extruding the resultant mix to form the `green electrode’. This is then baked under controlled conditions. In case of usage as anodes in steel electric furnaces (or as other carbon and graphite products), the electrodes could undergo further processing like pitch impregnation or graphitization. During heat treatment, some of the organics are destructively distilled, vaporized or decomposed, resulting in carbon deposition in the electrode. As the vaporized materials exit the body of the electrode they cause porosity in the walls, which results in reduction in density, current carrying capacity and flexural strength.</p>
					<p>The paper presents investigations to improve some physico-chemical characteristics of these electrodes (such as coefficient of thermal expansion, mechanical strengths, density, pore volume, porosity etc.), obtained in different manufacture steps, by addition of varieties of coal tar pitch. These include attempts to improve the chemical compatibility of the coke-pitch system in the mixture and establish the method and the point of introduction of additive, the concentration required and appropriate analytical control during the entire manufacture. Methods of analysis used include thermogravimetry and porosimetry. The microstructure of the electrodes is investigated through a wide range and the data obtained include pore size and pore volume distribution, surface area, porosity, particle size distribution and type of pores. The overall results clearly indicate better characteristics and performance for electrodes with additives as against electrodes without them, such as lower porosity, lower thermal expansion coefficients and greater mechanical strength. These data are analyzed with respect to the process step and electrode type.</p>

				<title>Characteristic polynomials of linear polyacenes and their subspectrality</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0027-0033</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coefficients of characteristic polynomials (CP) of linear polyacenes (LP) have been shown to be obtainable from Pascal’s triangle by using a graph factorisation and squaring technique. Strong subspectrality existing among the members of the linear polyacene series has been shown from the derivation of the CP’s. Thus it has been shown that the entire eigenspectrum of an $n$-ring LP is included in that of $(2n + 1)$-ring LP. Correspondence between the eigenspectra of linear chains and LP’s is brought out by a recently developed vertex-alternation and squaring algorithm.</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0035-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theory was applied to the calculation of molecular structures of N-methyl formamide (NMF), N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), and N,Ndimethyl acetamide (DMA). DFT calculations on NMF, DMF, and DMA were performed  using a combination of the local functional of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN) with the  nonlocal exchange functional of Becke and the nonlocal correlational functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr (BLYP). The adiabatic connection method (ACM) of Becke has also been used, for the first time, for the calculation of molecular structures of NMF, DMF, and DMA. The calculated molecular structures are in excellent agreement with the experimental geometries of NMF and DMA derived from gas-phase electron-diffraction studies. Sparse experimental data on the gas-phase geometry of DMF reported in the literature compares well with the DFT results on DMF. DFT emerges as a powerful method to calculate molecular structures.</p>

					<p>The interaction of 10-(3’-N-morpholinopropyl)phenoxazine [MPP], 10-(4’-N-morpholinobutyl)phenoxazine [MBP], 10-(3’-N-morpholinopropyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine [MPCP], 10-(3’-N-piperidinopropyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine [PPCP] or 10-(3’-N-morpholinopropyl)-2-trifluoromethylphenoxazine [MPTP] with bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been studied by gel filtration and equilibrium dialysis methods. The binding of these modulators, based on dialysis experiments, has been characterized using the following parameters: percentage of bound drug ($\beta$), the association constant ($K_1$), the apparent binding constant ($k$) and the free energy change ($\Delta F^\circ$). The binding of phenoxazine derivatives to serum transporter protein, BSA, is correlated with their octanol-water partition coefficient, $\log_{10}~ P$. In addition, effect of the displacing activities of hydroxyzine and acetylsalicylic acid on the binding of phenoxazine derivatives to albumin has been studied. Results of the displacement experiments show that phenoxazine benzene rings and tertiary amines attached to the side chain of the phenoxazine moiety are bound to a hydrophobic area on the albumin molecule.</p>

				<title>Pulsed laser excitation of phosphate stabilised silver nanoparticles</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0063-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser flash photolysis studies were carried out on two types of silver nanoparticles prepared by  $\gamma$-radiolysis of $Ag^+$ solutions in the presence of polyphosphate as the stabiliser. Type I silver nanoparticles displayed a surface plasmon band at 390 nm. Type II silver nanoparticles showed a 390 nm surface plasmon band with a shoulder at 550 nm. On photoexcitation in the surface plasmon band region, using 35 picosecond laser pulses at 355 nm and 532 nm, the type II solutions showed transient bleaching and absorption signals in the 450–900 nm region, which did not decay appreciably up to 5 nanoseconds. These transient changes were found to get annealed in the interval  $t$ where $5 \text{ ns } &lt; t &lt; 100$ ns. Extended photolysis of the nanoparticle solutions with repetitive laser pulses resulted in a decrease in the values of the average particle size which were measured by employing the dynamic light scattering technique.</p>

				<page>0073-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of formic and oxalic acids by quinolinium fluorochromate (QFC) have been studied in dimethylsulphoxide. The main product of oxidation is carbon dioxide. The reaction is first-order with respect to QFC. Michaelis–Menten type of kinetics were observed with respect to the reductants. The reaction is acid-catalysed and the acid dependence has the form: $k_{\text obs} = a + b[H^+]$. The oxidation of $\alpha$-deuterioformic acid exhibits a substantial primary kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 6⋅01$ at 303 K). The reaction has been studied in nineteen different organic solvents and the solvent effect has been analysed using Taft’s and Swain’s multiparametric equations. The temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect indicates the presence of a symmetrical cyclic transition state in the rate-determining step. Suitable mechanisms have been proposed</p>

				<page>0083-0095</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The design and fabrication of a Smalley-type cluster source in combination with a reflectron based time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer are reported. The generation of clusters is based on supersonic jet expansion of the sampling plume. Sample cells for both liquid and solid targets developed for this purpose are described. Two pulsed Nd-YAG lasers are used in tandem, one (532 nm) for target vapourization and the other (355 nm) for cluster ionization. Methanol clusters of nuclearity up to 14 (mass 500 amu) were produced from liquid methanol as the test sample. The clusters were detected with a mass resolution of ~ 2500 in the R-TOF geometry. Carbon clusters up to a nuclearity of 28 were obtained using a polyimide target. The utility of the instrument is demonstrated by carrying out experiments to generate mixed clusters from alcohol mixtures.</p>

					<p>The semiempirical AM1 SCF-MO method is used to study the benzyne mechanism for aromatic nucleophilic substitution of various  $m$-substituted chlorobenzenes and 3-chloropyridine. The calculations predict that most of the fixed substituents studied here would induce the formation of 2,3-arynes through their electron-withdrawing resonance or inductive effects. The geometry and electronic structure of the 2,3- and 3,4-arynes investigated here, confirm the generally accepted $o$-benzyne structure postulated for arynes. The sites of nucleophilic addition to arynes as predicted here are in fair agreement with expectation and experimental findings.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of cadmium sulphide in pure and mixed Langmuir–Blodgett films of $n$-octadecylsuccinic acid</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0109-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanoparticles were grown by the reaction of sodium sulphide (Na$_2$S) with Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of cadmium salts of $n$-octadecylsuccinic acid (ODSU) and with LB films of ODSU in mixtures of octadecylamine and octadecyl alcohol. The results indicate that heterogeneous nucleation and aggregation in the pure ODSU LB films due to processes like Ostwald ripening are destabilized by the presence of the long-chain amine and alcohol in mixed systems. CdS nanoparticles in the LB films were monitored by UV-visible absorption spectra, which allow an estimation of the size of the particles. The morphology, size and nature of the nanocrystallites formed depend on whether the sulphidation was done on the pure film or in the mixed films. It is seen that particles of size around 1⋅6 nm were formed in ODSU/octadecylalcohol and ODSU/octadecylamine mixed LB films while in pure ODSU films the size was about 2⋅7 nm. These films showed typical needle-shaped structures, as observed by the optical microscopic technique. Mean size and morphology were confirmed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, while selective area electron diffraction patterns showed six-fold symmetry and indicated that the CdS crystals grow epitaxially with respect to the monolayer. Further, the crystallisation enhanced in the mixed LB films showed a characteristic zinc oxide (Wurtzite) structure compared with the pure ODSU matrix. </p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The influence of 3-methyl-2,6-diphenyl piperidin-4-one (MDPO) and 2-phenyl decahydroquinoline-4-one (PDQO) synthesised in the laboratory on hydrogen permeation and corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 1N H$_2$SO$_4$ has been studied using weight loss and various electrochemical AC and DC corrosion-monitoring techniques. Both the compounds inhibit the corrosion of mild steel in H$_2$SO$_4$ Potentiodynamic polarisation studies clearly reveal that they behave predominantly as cathodic inhibitors. The extent of decrease in hydrogen permeation current through steel surfaces has been studied by the hydrogen electropermeation technique. Double layer capacitance ($C_{dl}$) and charge transfer resistance ($R_t$) values are derived from Nyquist plots obtained from AC impedance studies. The adsorption of these compounds on mild steel surfaces from H$_2$SO$_4$ obeys Temkin’s adsorption isotherm.</p>

Using this index antitubercular activities of N-2,4-difluorophenyl quinolones are subjected to quantitative structure–activity relationship analysis. The potential of Sz related to the Wiener index (W) is critically discussed. In addition, Huckel molecular orbital energies: $E_{\text HOMO}$, $E_{\text LUMO}$ and $E_{\text total}$ were also used for comparing and modelling antitubercular activities of the quinolones.

				<abstract>
					<p>In a reaction sequence of amide addition followed by halogen oxidation the triazasulphite S(NR)$^{2 −}_3$ and the tetrazasulphate S(NR)$^{2 −}_4$ are readily accessible from sulphur diimide S(NR)$_2$ via sulphur triimide S(NR)$_3$. Addition of lithium organics to sulphur triimide provides a general route to triazasulphonates RS(NR)$^{2−}_3$. All these anions resemble potential tripodal coordination behaviour because of their nitrogen donor centres. Furthermore, the sulphur polyimido ligands are capable of responding to the various requirements of different metals (even in mixed metal species) by charge (de)localization. This paper deals with the synthetic routes of the sulphur nitrogen anions and their coordination behaviour. Their reactivity, mainly towards main group metal synthons, is also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Platinum group metal chalcogenides find extensive applications in catalysis and in the electronic industry. To develop an efficient low temperature clean preparation of these materials, molecular routes have been explored. Thus the chemistry of mononuclear organochalcogenolates of the type [M(ER $1/4$)$_2$(PR$_3$)$_2$], binuclear benzylselenolates, [M$_2$Cl$_2$($\sim$-SeBz)$_2$(PR$_3$)$_2$], allylpalladium complexes [Pd$_2$($\sim$-ER)$_2$($y^3-C$_4$H$_7$)$_2$] and palladium/platinum sulphido/selenido-bridged  complexes, [M$_2$($\sim$-E)$_2$L$_4$] (M = Pd or Pt; E = S, Se or Te; L = tertiary phosphine ligand) has been investigated. All the complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, NMR ({}^1 H, {}^{31}P, {}^{77}Se, {}^{195}Pt) spectroscopy and in some cases by X-ray diffraction. The thermal behaviour of these complexes has been studied by TGA. The pyrolysis of allylpalladium complexes in refluxing xylene yields Pd$_4$E as established by analysis and XRD patterns.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>\textit{De novo} design of artificial proteins is an essential approach to elucidate the principles of protein architecture and to understand specific functions of natural proteins and also to yield novel molecules for medical and industrial aims. We have designed artificial sequences of 153 amino acids to fit the main-chain framework of the sperm whale myoglobin structure based on the knowledge-based energy functions  to evaluate the compatibility between protein tertiary structures and amino acid sequences. The synthesized artificial globins bind a single heme per protein molecule  as designed, which show well-defined electrochemical and spectroscopic features characteristic of proteins with a low-spin heme. Redox and ligand binding reactions of the artificial heme proteins were investigated and these heme-related functions were found to vary with their structural uniqueness. Relationships between the structural and functional properties are discussed.</p>

				<title>Models for the active site in galactose oxidase: Structure, spectra and redox of copper(II) complexes of certain phenolate ligands</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0223-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Galactose oxidase (GOase) is a fungal enzyme which is unusual among metalloenzymes in appearing to catalyse the two electron oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes and H$_2$O$_2$. The crystal structure of the enzyme reveals that the coordination geometry of mononuclear copper(II) ion is square pyramidal, with two histidine imidazoles, a tyrosinate, and either H$_2$O ($p$H 7 0) or acetate (from buffer, $p$H 4 5) in the equatorial sites and a tyrosinate ligand weakly bound in the axial position. This paper summarizes the results of our studies on the structure, spectral and redox properties of certain novel models for the active site of the inactive form of GOase. The monophenolato Cu(II) complexes of the type [Cu(L1)X][H(L1) = 2-(\textit{bis}(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)aminomethyl)-4-nitrophenol and X$^-$= Cl$^-${\bf 1}, NCS$^-${\bf 2}, CH$_3$COO$^-${\bf 3}, ClO$_4^-${\bf 4}] reveal a distorted square pyramidal geometry around Cu(II) with an unusual axial coordination of phenolate moiety. The coordination geometry of {\bf 3} is reminiscent of the active site of GOase with an axial phenolate and equatorial CH$_3$COO$^-$ ligands. All the present complexes exhibit several electronic and EPR spectral features which are also similar to the enzyme. Further, to establish the structural and spectroscopic consequences of the coordination of two tyrosinates in GOase enzyme, we studied the monomeric copper(II) complexes containing two phenolates and imidazole/pyridine donors as closer structural models for GOase. N,Ndimethylethylenediamine and N,N -dimethylethylenediamine have been used as starting materials to obtain a variety of 2,4-disubstituted phenolate ligands. The X-ray crystal structures of the complexes [Cu(L5)(py)], ({\bf 8}) [H$_2$ (L5) = N,N-dimethyl-N ,N -\textit{bis}(2-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzyl) ethylenediamine, py = pyridine] and [Cu(L8)(H$_2$O)] ({\bf 11}), [H$_2$(L8) = N,N -dimethyl-N,N -\textit{bis}(2-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzyl)ethylenediamine] reveal distorted square pyramidal geometries around Cu(II) with the axial tertiary amine nitrogen and water coordination respectively. Interestingly, for the latter complex there are two different molecules present in the same unit cell containing the methyl groups of the ethylenediamine fragment cis to each other in one molecule and trans to each other in the other. The ligand field and EPR spectra of the model complexes reveal square-based geometries even in solution. The electrochemical and chemical means of generating novel radical species of the model complexes, analogous to the active form of the enzyme is presently under investigation.</p>

					<p>Recent developments in the area of hybrid structures are overviewed with special emphasis on iron phosphate–oxalate materials. The structure of the iron phosphate–oxalates consists of iron phosphate chains or layers that are connected by oxalate moieties completing the architecture. The compounds exhibit interesting magnetic properties originating from the super-exchange interactions that are predominantly anti-ferromagnetic, involving the iron phosphates and the oxalate moieties. One of the materials, {\bf IV}, also exhibits interesting adsorptive properties reminiscent of aluminosilicate zeolites. The aluminum phosphate–oxalate,  {\bf VII},  indicates that hybrid structures can be formed with zeolite architecture.</p>

				<title>Extended metal–organic solids based on benzenepolycarboxylic and aminobenzoic acids</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0273-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes the recent results obtained in our laboratory on the interaction of polyfunctional ligands with divalent alkaline earth metal ions and a few  divalent transition metal ions. Treatment of MCl$_2$ $n$H$_2$O (M = Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba)with 2-amino benzoic acid leads to the formation of complexes [Mg(2-aba)$_2$] ({\bf 1}), [Ca(2-aba)$_2$(OH$_2$)$_3$] ({\bf 2}), [{Sr(2-aba)$_2$(OH$_2$)$_2$}$_2$ H$_2$O)] ({\bf 3}), [Ba(2-aba)$_2$(OH$_2$)] ({\bf 4}), respectively. While the calcium ions in {\bf 2} are hepta-coordinated, the strontium and barium ions in {\bf 3} and {\bf 4} reveal a coordination number of nine apart from additional metal–metal interactions. Apart from the carboxylate functionality, the amino group also binds to the metal centres in the case of strontium and barium complexes {\bf 3} and {\bf 4}. Complexes [{Mg(H$_2$O)_$6$}(4-aba)$_2$ 2H$_2$O] ({\bf 5}), [Ca(4-aba)$_2$(H_$2$O)$_2$] ({\bf 6}) prepared from 4-aminobenzoic acid reveal more open or layered structures. Interaction of 2-mercaptobenzoic acid with $MCl$_2$\cdot6H$_2$O (M = Mg, Ca), however, leads to the.oxidation of the thiol group resulting in the disulphide 2,2 -dithio\textit{bis}(benzoic acid). New metal–organic framework based hydrogen-bonded porous solids [{M(btec)(OH$_2$)4}$_n$ $n$(C$_4$H$_{12}$N$_2) 4$n$H_$2$O] (btec = 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylate) (M = Co {\bf 9}; Ni {\bf 10}; Zn {\bf 11}) have been synthesized from 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylic acid in the presence of piperazine. These compounds are made up of extensively hydrogenbonded alternating layers of anionic M-btec co-ordination polymer and piperazinium cations. Compounds {\bf 2–11} described herein form polymeric networks in the solid–state with the aid of different coordinating capabilities of the carboxylate anions hydrogen bonding interactions.</p>

				<title>Macrocyclic effects upon isomeric Cu$^{II}M$^{II}$ and M$^{II}$Cu$^{II}$ cores. Formation with unsymmetric phenol-based macrocyclic ligands</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0291-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper discusses coordination-position isomeric M$^{II}$Cu$^{II}$ and Cu$^{II}$M$^{II}$ complexes, using unsymmetric dinucleating macrocycles (L$^{m;n}$)$^{2-}$ ((L^{2;2})$^{2-$}$, (L$^{2;3})$^{2–}$ and (L^{2;4})$^{2–}$) that comprise two 2-(N-methyl)-aminomethyl-6-iminomethyl-4-bromophenonate entities, combined through the ethylene chain ($m = 2$) between the two amine nitrogens and through the ethylene, trimethylene or tetramethylene chain ($n = 2$, 3 or 4) between the two imine nitrogens. The macrocycles have dissimilar N(amine)$_2$O$_2$  and N(imine)$_2$O$_2$ metal-binding sites sharing the phenolic oxygens. The reaction of the mononuclear Cu$^{II}$ precursors, [Cu(L$^{2;2}$)], [Cu(L$^{2;2}$)] and [Cu(L$^{2;2}$)], with a M$^{II}$ perchlorate and a M$^{II}$ acetate salt formed (acetato)M$^{II}$ Cu$^{II}$ complexes:[CoCu(L^{2;2})(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 0 5H$_2$O] ({\bf 1}), [NiCu(L$^{2;2}$) (AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 2}), [ZnCu(L$^{2;2}$((AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 3}), [CoCu(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 0 5H$_2$O ({\bf 4}), [NiCu(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 5}), [ZnCu(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 0 5H$_2$O ({\bf 6}), [CoCu(L$^{2;4}$)(AcO)(DMF)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 7}), [NiCu(L$^{2;4}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 2DMF ({\bf 8}) and [ZnCu(L$^{2;4}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 9}) (the formulation [M$_a$M$_b$ (L$^{m;n}$)]$^{2+}$ means that M$_a$ resides in the aminic site and M$_b$ in the iminic site). The site selectivity of the metal ions is demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic studies for {\bf 2} MeOH, {\bf 3}, {\bf 5}, {\bf 7}, and {\bf 9}. An (acetato)Cu$^{II}$Zn$^{II}$ complex, [CuZn(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$^4$ ({\bf 10}), was obtained by the reaction of [PbCu(L$^{2;3}$)]-(ClO$_4$)$_2$ with ZnSO$_4$ 4H$_2$O, in the presence of sodium acetate. Other complexes of the Cu$^{II}$M$^{II}$ type were thermodynamically unstable to cause a scrambling of metal ions. The Cu migration from the iminic site to the aminic site in the synthesis of {\bf 10} is explained by the `kinetic macrocyclic effect’. The coordination-position isomers, {\bf 6} and {\bf 10}, are differentiated by physicochemical properties.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0311-0322</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have developed a new method for measuring in-situ the growth of the nanometre-size silica particles which lead to the formation of sol–gel glasses. This technique is based on the decay of fluorescence polarisation anisotropy due to Brownian rotation of dye molecules bound to the particles. Results to date give near ångstrom resolution and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach both for providing industrial quality control and helping fundamental research. Our approach has several key advantages over traditional techniques for nanometre metrology, such as small angle X-ray and neutron scattering and electron microscopy. In this paper we present silica particle growth dynamics in a hydrogel as detected by two near-infrared dyes, the effect of adding D$_2$O on the hydrodynamic radius and the effect of salt addition.</p>

				<title>Stereochemical trends of metal derivatives of some heterocyclic-2-thiones and thiosemicarbazones</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0323-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of heterocyclic thiones/thiosemicarbazones with metals has been the subject of several investigations as these ligands contain chemically active groups, –N(H)–C(=S)– –N=C(–SH)– ,and are useful model compounds for sulphur-containing analogues of purine and pyrimidine bases. Heterocylic-2-thiones  bind to metals in several ways and lead to the formation of monomeric or polymeric complexes. For example, the simplest prototype of heterocylic-2-thiones, namely, pyridine-2-thione has several ways of binding, notably, terminal S-bonding and S-bridging (in neutral form), while in anionic form the modes are terminal S-bonding, S-bridging, N,S-chelation, N,S-bridging, N,S-chelation-cum-S-bridging and N,S-bridging-cum-S-bridging. Similarly, thiosemicarbazones bind to metals as S-bonded unidentates or N,S-chelates. In this paper, the chemistry of pyridine-2-thione, its N-oxide, 2-(benzylthio)pyridine-1-oxide thione with metals like iron(II), ruthenium(II), nickel(II), palladium(II), platinum(II), copper(I), copper(II), silver(I) and mercury(II) is briefly described. As regards thiosemicarbazones, focus is only on two compounds, namely organomercury(II) and organothallium(III). A variety of new molecules, well characterised by NMR and X-ray crystallography, is introduced.</p>

				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0439-0448</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Isomorphously substituted molecular sieves, MAPO-31, NAPO-31 and ZAPO-31, were prepared under mild hydrothermal conditions from gels containing sources of aluminium, phosphorus, appropriate metal and dipropylamine (DPA), presumably acting as a structure-directing template. They were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TGA, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), ESR, Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) and diffusion reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) techniques. In the XRD, the peak at 2 = 16 7° of the metal substituted AlPO-31 is more intense than that of pure AlPO-31 suggesting preferential occupation of the plane corresponding to it as compared to other planes. The O-H stretch in the IR spectra of the metal-substituted molecular sieves is blue-shifted with respect to the parent AlPO-31 molecular sieves possibly due to metal substitution. The g values obtained from the ESR spectra of MAPO-31 and NAPO-31 also substantiate framework substitution. Ethylation of toluene was carried out between 300 and 450°C over the above catalysts as a model test reaction. The high toluene conversion over metal-substituted  molecular sieves proves the isomorphic substitution of metal ions in the AlPO-31 framework.</p>
