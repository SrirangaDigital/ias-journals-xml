				<title>Cobalt(III), nickel(II) and ruthenium(II) complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline family of ligands: DNA binding and photocleavage studies</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>DNA binding and photocleavage characteristics of a series of mixedligand complexes of the type [M(phen)2LL]$^{n+}$ (where M = Co(III), Ni(II) or Ru(II), LL = 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), phenanthroline-dione (phen-dione) or dipyridophenazine (dppz) and  $n = 3$ or 2) have been investigated in detail. Various physico-chemical and biochemical techniques including UV/Visible, fluorescence and viscometric titration, thermal denaturation, and differential pulse voltammetry have been employed to probe the details of DNA binding by these complexes; intrinsic binding constants (Kb) have been estimated under a similar set of experimental conditions. Analysis of the results suggests that intercalative ability of the coordinated ligands varies as dppz $&gt;$ phen $&lt;$ phen-dione in this series of complexes. While the Co(II) and Ru(II) complexes investigated in this study effect photocleavage of the supercoiled pBR 322 DNA, the corresponding Ni(II) complexes are found to be inactive under similar experimental conditions. Results of detailed investigations carried out inquiring into the mechanistic aspects of DNA photocleavage by [Co(phen)2 (dppz)]$^{3+}$ have also been reported. </p>

				<title>Improved technology for manufacture of carbon electrodes</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0019-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Current industrial carbon electrodes are typically manufactured by blending petroleum coke particles (the filler) with molten coal tar pitch (the binder) and extruding the resultant mix to form the `green electrode’. This is then baked under controlled conditions. In case of usage as anodes in steel electric furnaces (or as other carbon and graphite products), the electrodes could undergo further processing like pitch impregnation or graphitization. During heat treatment, some of the organics are destructively distilled, vaporized or decomposed, resulting in carbon deposition in the electrode. As the vaporized materials exit the body of the electrode they cause porosity in the walls, which results in reduction in density, current carrying capacity and flexural strength.</p>
					<p>The paper presents investigations to improve some physico-chemical characteristics of these electrodes (such as coefficient of thermal expansion, mechanical strengths, density, pore volume, porosity etc.), obtained in different manufacture steps, by addition of varieties of coal tar pitch. These include attempts to improve the chemical compatibility of the coke-pitch system in the mixture and establish the method and the point of introduction of additive, the concentration required and appropriate analytical control during the entire manufacture. Methods of analysis used include thermogravimetry and porosimetry. The microstructure of the electrodes is investigated through a wide range and the data obtained include pore size and pore volume distribution, surface area, porosity, particle size distribution and type of pores. The overall results clearly indicate better characteristics and performance for electrodes with additives as against electrodes without them, such as lower porosity, lower thermal expansion coefficients and greater mechanical strength. These data are analyzed with respect to the process step and electrode type.</p>

				<title>Characteristic polynomials of linear polyacenes and their subspectrality</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0027-0033</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coefficients of characteristic polynomials (CP) of linear polyacenes (LP) have been shown to be obtainable from Pascal’s triangle by using a graph factorisation and squaring technique. Strong subspectrality existing among the members of the linear polyacene series has been shown from the derivation of the CP’s. Thus it has been shown that the entire eigenspectrum of an $n$-ring LP is included in that of $(2n + 1)$-ring LP. Correspondence between the eigenspectra of linear chains and LP’s is brought out by a recently developed vertex-alternation and squaring algorithm.</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0035-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theory was applied to the calculation of molecular structures of N-methyl formamide (NMF), N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), and N,Ndimethyl acetamide (DMA). DFT calculations on NMF, DMF, and DMA were performed  using a combination of the local functional of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN) with the  nonlocal exchange functional of Becke and the nonlocal correlational functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr (BLYP). The adiabatic connection method (ACM) of Becke has also been used, for the first time, for the calculation of molecular structures of NMF, DMF, and DMA. The calculated molecular structures are in excellent agreement with the experimental geometries of NMF and DMA derived from gas-phase electron-diffraction studies. Sparse experimental data on the gas-phase geometry of DMF reported in the literature compares well with the DFT results on DMF. DFT emerges as a powerful method to calculate molecular structures.</p>

					<p>The interaction of 10-(3’-N-morpholinopropyl)phenoxazine [MPP], 10-(4’-N-morpholinobutyl)phenoxazine [MBP], 10-(3’-N-morpholinopropyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine [MPCP], 10-(3’-N-piperidinopropyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine [PPCP] or 10-(3’-N-morpholinopropyl)-2-trifluoromethylphenoxazine [MPTP] with bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been studied by gel filtration and equilibrium dialysis methods. The binding of these modulators, based on dialysis experiments, has been characterized using the following parameters: percentage of bound drug ($\beta$), the association constant ($K_1$), the apparent binding constant ($k$) and the free energy change ($\Delta F^\circ$). The binding of phenoxazine derivatives to serum transporter protein, BSA, is correlated with their octanol-water partition coefficient, $\log_{10}~ P$. In addition, effect of the displacing activities of hydroxyzine and acetylsalicylic acid on the binding of phenoxazine derivatives to albumin has been studied. Results of the displacement experiments show that phenoxazine benzene rings and tertiary amines attached to the side chain of the phenoxazine moiety are bound to a hydrophobic area on the albumin molecule.</p>

				<title>Pulsed laser excitation of phosphate stabilised silver nanoparticles</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0063-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser flash photolysis studies were carried out on two types of silver nanoparticles prepared by  $\gamma$-radiolysis of $Ag^+$ solutions in the presence of polyphosphate as the stabiliser. Type I silver nanoparticles displayed a surface plasmon band at 390 nm. Type II silver nanoparticles showed a 390 nm surface plasmon band with a shoulder at 550 nm. On photoexcitation in the surface plasmon band region, using 35 picosecond laser pulses at 355 nm and 532 nm, the type II solutions showed transient bleaching and absorption signals in the 450–900 nm region, which did not decay appreciably up to 5 nanoseconds. These transient changes were found to get annealed in the interval  $t$ where $5 \text{ ns } &lt; t &lt; 100$ ns. Extended photolysis of the nanoparticle solutions with repetitive laser pulses resulted in a decrease in the values of the average particle size which were measured by employing the dynamic light scattering technique.</p>

				<page>0073-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of formic and oxalic acids by quinolinium fluorochromate (QFC) have been studied in dimethylsulphoxide. The main product of oxidation is carbon dioxide. The reaction is first-order with respect to QFC. Michaelis–Menten type of kinetics were observed with respect to the reductants. The reaction is acid-catalysed and the acid dependence has the form: $k_{\text obs} = a + b[H^+]$. The oxidation of $\alpha$-deuterioformic acid exhibits a substantial primary kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 6⋅01$ at 303 K). The reaction has been studied in nineteen different organic solvents and the solvent effect has been analysed using Taft’s and Swain’s multiparametric equations. The temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect indicates the presence of a symmetrical cyclic transition state in the rate-determining step. Suitable mechanisms have been proposed</p>

				<page>0083-0095</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The design and fabrication of a Smalley-type cluster source in combination with a reflectron based time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer are reported. The generation of clusters is based on supersonic jet expansion of the sampling plume. Sample cells for both liquid and solid targets developed for this purpose are described. Two pulsed Nd-YAG lasers are used in tandem, one (532 nm) for target vapourization and the other (355 nm) for cluster ionization. Methanol clusters of nuclearity up to 14 (mass 500 amu) were produced from liquid methanol as the test sample. The clusters were detected with a mass resolution of ~ 2500 in the R-TOF geometry. Carbon clusters up to a nuclearity of 28 were obtained using a polyimide target. The utility of the instrument is demonstrated by carrying out experiments to generate mixed clusters from alcohol mixtures.</p>

					<p>The semiempirical AM1 SCF-MO method is used to study the benzyne mechanism for aromatic nucleophilic substitution of various  $m$-substituted chlorobenzenes and 3-chloropyridine. The calculations predict that most of the fixed substituents studied here would induce the formation of 2,3-arynes through their electron-withdrawing resonance or inductive effects. The geometry and electronic structure of the 2,3- and 3,4-arynes investigated here, confirm the generally accepted $o$-benzyne structure postulated for arynes. The sites of nucleophilic addition to arynes as predicted here are in fair agreement with expectation and experimental findings.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of cadmium sulphide in pure and mixed Langmuir–Blodgett films of $n$-octadecylsuccinic acid</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0109-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanoparticles were grown by the reaction of sodium sulphide (Na$_2$S) with Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of cadmium salts of $n$-octadecylsuccinic acid (ODSU) and with LB films of ODSU in mixtures of octadecylamine and octadecyl alcohol. The results indicate that heterogeneous nucleation and aggregation in the pure ODSU LB films due to processes like Ostwald ripening are destabilized by the presence of the long-chain amine and alcohol in mixed systems. CdS nanoparticles in the LB films were monitored by UV-visible absorption spectra, which allow an estimation of the size of the particles. The morphology, size and nature of the nanocrystallites formed depend on whether the sulphidation was done on the pure film or in the mixed films. It is seen that particles of size around 1⋅6 nm were formed in ODSU/octadecylalcohol and ODSU/octadecylamine mixed LB films while in pure ODSU films the size was about 2⋅7 nm. These films showed typical needle-shaped structures, as observed by the optical microscopic technique. Mean size and morphology were confirmed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, while selective area electron diffraction patterns showed six-fold symmetry and indicated that the CdS crystals grow epitaxially with respect to the monolayer. Further, the crystallisation enhanced in the mixed LB films showed a characteristic zinc oxide (Wurtzite) structure compared with the pure ODSU matrix. </p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The influence of 3-methyl-2,6-diphenyl piperidin-4-one (MDPO) and 2-phenyl decahydroquinoline-4-one (PDQO) synthesised in the laboratory on hydrogen permeation and corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 1N H$_2$SO$_4$ has been studied using weight loss and various electrochemical AC and DC corrosion-monitoring techniques. Both the compounds inhibit the corrosion of mild steel in H$_2$SO$_4$ Potentiodynamic polarisation studies clearly reveal that they behave predominantly as cathodic inhibitors. The extent of decrease in hydrogen permeation current through steel surfaces has been studied by the hydrogen electropermeation technique. Double layer capacitance ($C_{dl}$) and charge transfer resistance ($R_t$) values are derived from Nyquist plots obtained from AC impedance studies. The adsorption of these compounds on mild steel surfaces from H$_2$SO$_4$ obeys Temkin’s adsorption isotherm.</p>

Using this index antitubercular activities of N-2,4-difluorophenyl quinolones are subjected to quantitative structure–activity relationship analysis. The potential of Sz related to the Wiener index (W) is critically discussed. In addition, Huckel molecular orbital energies: $E_{\text HOMO}$, $E_{\text LUMO}$ and $E_{\text total}$ were also used for comparing and modelling antitubercular activities of the quinolones.

				<abstract>
					<p>In a reaction sequence of amide addition followed by halogen oxidation the triazasulphite S(NR)$^{2 −}_3$ and the tetrazasulphate S(NR)$^{2 −}_4$ are readily accessible from sulphur diimide S(NR)$_2$ via sulphur triimide S(NR)$_3$. Addition of lithium organics to sulphur triimide provides a general route to triazasulphonates RS(NR)$^{2−}_3$. All these anions resemble potential tripodal coordination behaviour because of their nitrogen donor centres. Furthermore, the sulphur polyimido ligands are capable of responding to the various requirements of different metals (even in mixed metal species) by charge (de)localization. This paper deals with the synthetic routes of the sulphur nitrogen anions and their coordination behaviour. Their reactivity, mainly towards main group metal synthons, is also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Platinum group metal chalcogenides find extensive applications in catalysis and in the electronic industry. To develop an efficient low temperature clean preparation of these materials, molecular routes have been explored. Thus the chemistry of mononuclear organochalcogenolates of the type [M(ER $1/4$)$_2$(PR$_3$)$_2$], binuclear benzylselenolates, [M$_2$Cl$_2$($\sim$-SeBz)$_2$(PR$_3$)$_2$], allylpalladium complexes [Pd$_2$($\sim$-ER)$_2$($y^3-C$_4$H$_7$)$_2$] and palladium/platinum sulphido/selenido-bridged  complexes, [M$_2$($\sim$-E)$_2$L$_4$] (M = Pd or Pt; E = S, Se or Te; L = tertiary phosphine ligand) has been investigated. All the complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, NMR ({}^1 H, {}^{31}P, {}^{77}Se, {}^{195}Pt) spectroscopy and in some cases by X-ray diffraction. The thermal behaviour of these complexes has been studied by TGA. The pyrolysis of allylpalladium complexes in refluxing xylene yields Pd$_4$E as established by analysis and XRD patterns.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>\textit{De novo} design of artificial proteins is an essential approach to elucidate the principles of protein architecture and to understand specific functions of natural proteins and also to yield novel molecules for medical and industrial aims. We have designed artificial sequences of 153 amino acids to fit the main-chain framework of the sperm whale myoglobin structure based on the knowledge-based energy functions  to evaluate the compatibility between protein tertiary structures and amino acid sequences. The synthesized artificial globins bind a single heme per protein molecule  as designed, which show well-defined electrochemical and spectroscopic features characteristic of proteins with a low-spin heme. Redox and ligand binding reactions of the artificial heme proteins were investigated and these heme-related functions were found to vary with their structural uniqueness. Relationships between the structural and functional properties are discussed.</p>

				<title>Models for the active site in galactose oxidase: Structure, spectra and redox of copper(II) complexes of certain phenolate ligands</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0223-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Galactose oxidase (GOase) is a fungal enzyme which is unusual among metalloenzymes in appearing to catalyse the two electron oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes and H$_2$O$_2$. The crystal structure of the enzyme reveals that the coordination geometry of mononuclear copper(II) ion is square pyramidal, with two histidine imidazoles, a tyrosinate, and either H$_2$O ($p$H 7 0) or acetate (from buffer, $p$H 4 5) in the equatorial sites and a tyrosinate ligand weakly bound in the axial position. This paper summarizes the results of our studies on the structure, spectral and redox properties of certain novel models for the active site of the inactive form of GOase. The monophenolato Cu(II) complexes of the type [Cu(L1)X][H(L1) = 2-(\textit{bis}(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)aminomethyl)-4-nitrophenol and X$^-$= Cl$^-${\bf 1}, NCS$^-${\bf 2}, CH$_3$COO$^-${\bf 3}, ClO$_4^-${\bf 4}] reveal a distorted square pyramidal geometry around Cu(II) with an unusual axial coordination of phenolate moiety. The coordination geometry of {\bf 3} is reminiscent of the active site of GOase with an axial phenolate and equatorial CH$_3$COO$^-$ ligands. All the present complexes exhibit several electronic and EPR spectral features which are also similar to the enzyme. Further, to establish the structural and spectroscopic consequences of the coordination of two tyrosinates in GOase enzyme, we studied the monomeric copper(II) complexes containing two phenolates and imidazole/pyridine donors as closer structural models for GOase. N,Ndimethylethylenediamine and N,N -dimethylethylenediamine have been used as starting materials to obtain a variety of 2,4-disubstituted phenolate ligands. The X-ray crystal structures of the complexes [Cu(L5)(py)], ({\bf 8}) [H$_2$ (L5) = N,N-dimethyl-N ,N -\textit{bis}(2-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzyl) ethylenediamine, py = pyridine] and [Cu(L8)(H$_2$O)] ({\bf 11}), [H$_2$(L8) = N,N -dimethyl-N,N -\textit{bis}(2-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzyl)ethylenediamine] reveal distorted square pyramidal geometries around Cu(II) with the axial tertiary amine nitrogen and water coordination respectively. Interestingly, for the latter complex there are two different molecules present in the same unit cell containing the methyl groups of the ethylenediamine fragment cis to each other in one molecule and trans to each other in the other. The ligand field and EPR spectra of the model complexes reveal square-based geometries even in solution. The electrochemical and chemical means of generating novel radical species of the model complexes, analogous to the active form of the enzyme is presently under investigation.</p>

					<p>Recent developments in the area of hybrid structures are overviewed with special emphasis on iron phosphate–oxalate materials. The structure of the iron phosphate–oxalates consists of iron phosphate chains or layers that are connected by oxalate moieties completing the architecture. The compounds exhibit interesting magnetic properties originating from the super-exchange interactions that are predominantly anti-ferromagnetic, involving the iron phosphates and the oxalate moieties. One of the materials, {\bf IV}, also exhibits interesting adsorptive properties reminiscent of aluminosilicate zeolites. The aluminum phosphate–oxalate,  {\bf VII},  indicates that hybrid structures can be formed with zeolite architecture.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0273-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes the recent results obtained in our laboratory on the interaction of polyfunctional ligands with divalent alkaline earth metal ions and a few  divalent transition metal ions. Treatment of MCl$_2$ $n$H$_2$O (M = Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba)with 2-amino benzoic acid leads to the formation of complexes [Mg(2-aba)$_2$] ({\bf 1}), [Ca(2-aba)$_2$(OH$_2$)$_3$] ({\bf 2}), [{Sr(2-aba)$_2$(OH$_2$)$_2$}$_2$ H$_2$O)] ({\bf 3}), [Ba(2-aba)$_2$(OH$_2$)] ({\bf 4}), respectively. While the calcium ions in {\bf 2} are hepta-coordinated, the strontium and barium ions in {\bf 3} and {\bf 4} reveal a coordination number of nine apart from additional metal–metal interactions. Apart from the carboxylate functionality, the amino group also binds to the metal centres in the case of strontium and barium complexes {\bf 3} and {\bf 4}. Complexes [{Mg(H$_2$O)_$6$}(4-aba)$_2$ 2H$_2$O] ({\bf 5}), [Ca(4-aba)$_2$(H_$2$O)$_2$] ({\bf 6}) prepared from 4-aminobenzoic acid reveal more open or layered structures. Interaction of 2-mercaptobenzoic acid with $MCl$_2$\cdot6H$_2$O (M = Mg, Ca), however, leads to the.oxidation of the thiol group resulting in the disulphide 2,2 -dithio\textit{bis}(benzoic acid). New metal–organic framework based hydrogen-bonded porous solids [{M(btec)(OH$_2$)4}$_n$ $n$(C$_4$H$_{12}$N$_2) 4$n$H_$2$O] (btec = 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylate) (M = Co {\bf 9}; Ni {\bf 10}; Zn {\bf 11}) have been synthesized from 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylic acid in the presence of piperazine. These compounds are made up of extensively hydrogenbonded alternating layers of anionic M-btec co-ordination polymer and piperazinium cations. Compounds {\bf 2–11} described herein form polymeric networks in the solid–state with the aid of different coordinating capabilities of the carboxylate anions hydrogen bonding interactions.</p>

				<title>Macrocyclic effects upon isomeric Cu$^{II}M$^{II}$ and M$^{II}$Cu$^{II}$ cores. Formation with unsymmetric phenol-based macrocyclic ligands</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0291-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper discusses coordination-position isomeric M$^{II}$Cu$^{II}$ and Cu$^{II}$M$^{II}$ complexes, using unsymmetric dinucleating macrocycles (L$^{m;n}$)$^{2-}$ ((L^{2;2})$^{2-$}$, (L$^{2;3})$^{2–}$ and (L^{2;4})$^{2–}$) that comprise two 2-(N-methyl)-aminomethyl-6-iminomethyl-4-bromophenonate entities, combined through the ethylene chain ($m = 2$) between the two amine nitrogens and through the ethylene, trimethylene or tetramethylene chain ($n = 2$, 3 or 4) between the two imine nitrogens. The macrocycles have dissimilar N(amine)$_2$O$_2$  and N(imine)$_2$O$_2$ metal-binding sites sharing the phenolic oxygens. The reaction of the mononuclear Cu$^{II}$ precursors, [Cu(L$^{2;2}$)], [Cu(L$^{2;2}$)] and [Cu(L$^{2;2}$)], with a M$^{II}$ perchlorate and a M$^{II}$ acetate salt formed (acetato)M$^{II}$ Cu$^{II}$ complexes:[CoCu(L^{2;2})(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 0 5H$_2$O] ({\bf 1}), [NiCu(L$^{2;2}$) (AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 2}), [ZnCu(L$^{2;2}$((AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 3}), [CoCu(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 0 5H$_2$O ({\bf 4}), [NiCu(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 5}), [ZnCu(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 0 5H$_2$O ({\bf 6}), [CoCu(L$^{2;4}$)(AcO)(DMF)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 7}), [NiCu(L$^{2;4}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ 2DMF ({\bf 8}) and [ZnCu(L$^{2;4}$)(AcO)]ClO$_4$ ({\bf 9}) (the formulation [M$_a$M$_b$ (L$^{m;n}$)]$^{2+}$ means that M$_a$ resides in the aminic site and M$_b$ in the iminic site). The site selectivity of the metal ions is demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic studies for {\bf 2} MeOH, {\bf 3}, {\bf 5}, {\bf 7}, and {\bf 9}. An (acetato)Cu$^{II}$Zn$^{II}$ complex, [CuZn(L$^{2;3}$)(AcO)]ClO$^4$ ({\bf 10}), was obtained by the reaction of [PbCu(L$^{2;3}$)]-(ClO$_4$)$_2$ with ZnSO$_4$ 4H$_2$O, in the presence of sodium acetate. Other complexes of the Cu$^{II}$M$^{II}$ type were thermodynamically unstable to cause a scrambling of metal ions. The Cu migration from the iminic site to the aminic site in the synthesis of {\bf 10} is explained by the `kinetic macrocyclic effect’. The coordination-position isomers, {\bf 6} and {\bf 10}, are differentiated by physicochemical properties.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0311-0322</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have developed a new method for measuring in-situ the growth of the nanometre-size silica particles which lead to the formation of sol–gel glasses. This technique is based on the decay of fluorescence polarisation anisotropy due to Brownian rotation of dye molecules bound to the particles. Results to date give near ångstrom resolution and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach both for providing industrial quality control and helping fundamental research. Our approach has several key advantages over traditional techniques for nanometre metrology, such as small angle X-ray and neutron scattering and electron microscopy. In this paper we present silica particle growth dynamics in a hydrogel as detected by two near-infrared dyes, the effect of adding D$_2$O on the hydrodynamic radius and the effect of salt addition.</p>

				<title>Stereochemical trends of metal derivatives of some heterocyclic-2-thiones and thiosemicarbazones</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0323-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of heterocyclic thiones/thiosemicarbazones with metals has been the subject of several investigations as these ligands contain chemically active groups, –N(H)–C(=S)– –N=C(–SH)– ,and are useful model compounds for sulphur-containing analogues of purine and pyrimidine bases. Heterocylic-2-thiones  bind to metals in several ways and lead to the formation of monomeric or polymeric complexes. For example, the simplest prototype of heterocylic-2-thiones, namely, pyridine-2-thione has several ways of binding, notably, terminal S-bonding and S-bridging (in neutral form), while in anionic form the modes are terminal S-bonding, S-bridging, N,S-chelation, N,S-bridging, N,S-chelation-cum-S-bridging and N,S-bridging-cum-S-bridging. Similarly, thiosemicarbazones bind to metals as S-bonded unidentates or N,S-chelates. In this paper, the chemistry of pyridine-2-thione, its N-oxide, 2-(benzylthio)pyridine-1-oxide thione with metals like iron(II), ruthenium(II), nickel(II), palladium(II), platinum(II), copper(I), copper(II), silver(I) and mercury(II) is briefly described. As regards thiosemicarbazones, focus is only on two compounds, namely organomercury(II) and organothallium(III). A variety of new molecules, well characterised by NMR and X-ray crystallography, is introduced.</p>

				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0439-0448</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Isomorphously substituted molecular sieves, MAPO-31, NAPO-31 and ZAPO-31, were prepared under mild hydrothermal conditions from gels containing sources of aluminium, phosphorus, appropriate metal and dipropylamine (DPA), presumably acting as a structure-directing template. They were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TGA, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), ESR, Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) and diffusion reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) techniques. In the XRD, the peak at 2 = 16 7° of the metal substituted AlPO-31 is more intense than that of pure AlPO-31 suggesting preferential occupation of the plane corresponding to it as compared to other planes. The O-H stretch in the IR spectra of the metal-substituted molecular sieves is blue-shifted with respect to the parent AlPO-31 molecular sieves possibly due to metal substitution. The g values obtained from the ESR spectra of MAPO-31 and NAPO-31 also substantiate framework substitution. Ethylation of toluene was carried out between 300 and 450°C over the above catalysts as a model test reaction. The high toluene conversion over metal-substituted  molecular sieves proves the isomorphic substitution of metal ions in the AlPO-31 framework.</p>

				<page>00-00</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article illustrates the application of a 2$&#37;$ ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate–cross-linked polystyrene support (EGDMA–PS) in manual solid phase peptide synthesis. This copolymer has been characterised and optimised for peptide synthesis by performing the synthesis of a few model peptides and two biologically important peptides. EGDMA–cross-linked polystyrene support was prepared by the suspension polymerisation of the monomers EGDMA and styrene. EGDMA–PS resin undergoes facile swelling in a variety of solvents, both polar and nonpolar, used in peptide synthesis. The polymer was functionalised by Friedel–Crafts chloromethylation reaction. Peptides were assembled on a 2$&#37;$ cross-linked chloromethyl polymer support of capacity 1 63 mmol Cl/g. The biological peptides synthesised are an 11-residue peptide ATP binding site of the CDC2 kinase and a difficult sequence-a nineresidue peptide  34-42 corresponding to a portion of the hydrophobic terminus of the-amyloid protein  1-42. After synthesis, the peptides were cleaved from the support by treating with neat TFA. Purity of the peptides obtained in good yield was checked by TLC and HPLC methods and found to be fairly high.</p>

					<p>The changes in the electronic absorption spectra of ferrocene in the halocarbon solvents chloroform and carbontetrachloride have been investigated under photoexcitation in nitrogen atmosphere. Photoexcitations have been made with monochromatic light (using an Xe-source and a monochromator), at intervals of a few nanometers in the spectral range 220–750 nm. Analysing the spectra  by a modified method the position of the charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) band has been located for both the solvents. The position of the CTTS band in the case of carbontetrachloride solution located (320 nm) by the present study is different from the previously reported value (307 nm), while from the previous studies the position of the CTTS band in the case of the spectra of ferrocene in chloroform was not clear. From the present investigation, the changes in spectra after photoexcitation studied as a function, the concentration of ferrocene in the solution and the time (duration) of photoexcitations, have been observed to be systematic. Using the position of the new band (320 nm) for the CTTS transition in the case of carbontetrachloride, ionization potential of ferrocene has been estimated and the estimated value has shown excellent agreement with the experimental value indicating the exactness of the newly located CTTS band position.</p>

				<page>0487-0496</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pulse radiolysis technique has been employed to investigate the reaction of DNA-minor-groove ligand  \textit{bis}benzimidazole Hoechst 33258 with pyrimidine and purine nucleotide-derived radicals. Formation of an N-centred Hoechst-33258 radical is observed. Bimolecular rate constants and the yields of Hoechst-33258 radical have been evaluated. While the rate constant for the reaction of pyrimidine-derived radicals with Hoechst-33258 remained the same (1–2) $\times$ $10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, the yields of the Hoechst-33258 radical varied from 25$&#37;$ (5 -cytidine monophosphate) to 75$&#37;$ (5 -guanosine monophosphate) under anoxic conditions. The rate constant values for the reaction of purine-derived radicals with Hoechst-33258, under oxic and anoxic conditions, remained the same whereas with pyrimidine-derived radicals, the rate constant value under oxic conditions was about two orders of magnitude lower than under anoxic conditions. The difference in the yields of Hoechst-33258 radical with various nucleotide-derived radicals suggest the formation of different types of radicals and that the reaction mainly occurs by electron transfer from Hoechst-33258 to the nucleotide radicals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of induced decomposition of potassium peroxomonosulphate (PMS) by the phase transfer catalysts (PTC), viz. tetrabutylammonium chloride [TBAC] and tetrabutylphosphonium chloride [TBPC] have been investigated. The effect of [PMS], [PTC], ionic strength of the medium and temperature on the rate of decomposition of PMS was studied. The rate of decomposition of PMS was monitored under pseudo-first-order condition at a constant temperature (50 $\pm$ 0 1$^\circ$C). The rate of decomposition was first order with respect to PMS for TBAC and half order for TBPC. The order with respect of PTC was found to be unity for TBAC and half order for TBPC. A suitable kinetic scheme has been proposed to account for the experimental data and its significance is discussed.</p>

					<p>The kinetics of the oxidation of nickel (II) hexaaza and nickel (II) pentaaza macrocycles by the peroxydisulphate anion, S$_2$O$_8^{2-}$, were studied in aqueous media. Effect of $p$H on reaction rate was also studied. The rate increases with increase of S$_2$O$_8^{2-}$ concentration. Rates are almost independent of acid between  $p$H 4 and 2, giving overall a relatively simple second-order rate law followed by oxidation within the ion pair solvent shell. Using rate = +1/2 d[Ni(L)$^{3+}$]/dt = k[Ni(L)$^{2+}$][S_2O$_8^{2-}$], oxidation rate constants were determined.</p>

					<p>2-(Arylazo)pyrimidines (aapm) are N,N -chelating ligands and synthesise orange-red complexes of composition [Pd(aapm)Cl$_2$],  {\bf 1}, with Pd(MeCN)$_2$Cl$_2$ in MeCN. The complex has  \textit{cis}-PdCl$_2$ configuration [(Pd−Cl): 340, 360 cm$^{-1}$]. The treatment of Tollen’s reagent (`AgOH’) leads to chelatative hydroxylation in the pendant aryl ring, affording a green phenolato complex, Pd(aapmO)Cl, {\bf 5} (aapmO is deprotonated 2-((8-hydroxo)arylazo)pyrimidine). The reaction is also carried out by controlled addition of dilute sodium hydroxide in air or by the addition of PhIO/$m$-chloroperbenzoic acid to a MeCN suspension of the complex. A single Pd–Cl stretch at 360 cm$^{-1}$ supports the composition of phenolato complex. Unlike Pd(aapm)Cl$_2$ the hydroxylated product, Pd(aapmO)Cl, has a structured intense absorption in the visible region near 670 nm. The Pd–Cl bond in Pd(aapmO)Cl is highly sensitive to nucleophilic substitution and slowly hydrolyses in aqueous medium.</p>

The hydrothermal treatments result in the activation of the perovskite oxides by increasing their surface area very markedly.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A search for non-cyanide plating baths for copper resulted in the development of alkaline copper complex baths containing trisodium citrate [TSC] and triethanolamine [TEA]. Voltammetric studies were carried out on platinum to understand the electrochemical behaviour of these complexes. In TSC solutions, the deposition of copper involves the slow formation of a monovalent species. Adsorption of this species obeys Langmuir isotherm. In TEA solutions the deposition involves the formation of monovalent ions obeying the non-activated Temkin isotherm. Conversion of divalent to monovalent copper is also slow. In TEA and TSC alkaline copper solutions, the predominant species that undergo stepwise reduction contain only TEA ligands</p>

				<title>Oxidation of caffeine by phosphate radical anion in aqueous solution under anoxic conditions</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0551-0557</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The photooxidation of caffeine in presence of peroxydiphosphate (PDP) in aqueous solution at natural $p$H ($\sim$7 5) has been carried out in a quantum yield reactor using a high-pressure mercury lamp. The reactions  were followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of caffeine at {}_${\max}$ (272 nm). The rates of reaction were calculated under different experimental conditions. The quantum yields were calculated from the rates of oxidation of caffeine and the intensity of light at 254 nm which was measured by using peroxydisulphate solution as a standard chemical actinometer. The reaction rates of oxidation of caffeine by PDP increase with increase in [PDP] as well as with increase in light intensity, while they are independent of [caffeine]. The quantum yields of oxidation of caffeine by PDP are independent of [PDP] as well as light intensity. However, quantum yields of oxidation of caffeine by PDP increase with increase in caffeine concentration. On the basis of these experimental results and product analysis, a probable mechanism has been suggested in which PDP is activated to phosphate radical anions (PO$_4^{.2-}$) by direct photolysis of PDP and also by the sensitizing effect of caffeine. The phosphate radical anions thus produced react with caffeine by electron transfer reaction, resulting in the formation of caffeine radical cation, which deprotonates in a fast step to produce C8OH adduct radicals. These radicals might react with PDP to give final product 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid and PO$_4^{.2-}$ radicals, the latter propagates the chain reaction.</p>

					<p>The reactions were sensitive between seven rare earth (RE) metals Nd(III), La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), Sm(III), Eu(III) and Gd(III) and dibromo-$p$-methylmethylsulfonazo (DBMMSA) in acidic solution. The spectral correction method has been applied in the determination of properties of RE complexes instead of ordinary spectrophotometry. Composition ratios, real molar absorptivities ( ) and stepwise stability constants ($K$) of each of the RE complexes were determined easily because the method eliminated the absorption influence of excess of ligand on complex. Results showed that the cumulative  $K$ values of the complexes were between 3 91 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ and 2 34 $\times$ 10$^{28}$ and the real (not apparent) absorptivity between 8 85 $\times$ 10$^4$ and 2 12 $\times$ 10$^5$ l mol$^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 640 nm.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and equilibria of the axial ligation of alkyl(aquo)cobaloximes by imidazole and cyanide have been measured spectrophotometrically in aqueous solutions of ionic strength 1⋅0 M at 25$\circ$C as a function of $p$H. Comparison of $K_{\text{IMD}}$ and $K_{\text{CN}}$– of CH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$ and BrCH$_2$ cobaloximes indicates that their stability is in the order BrCH$_2$ $&gt;$ CH$_3$ $&gt;$ C$_2$H$_5$. As the electron-withdrawing capacity of the alkyl group \textit{trans} to water increases, the electron density of the cobalt(III) decreases and thus it becomes a stronger Lewis acid and binds more strongly to imidazole and cyanide. The association and dissociation rate constants are better correlated to the relative softness of the ligand showing that cyanide binds 30 times faster than imidazole. These complexes are isolated and are characterized by IR and ${}^1$H NMR spectra.</p>

				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0001-0009</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metalloderivatives of anionic tetrasulphonated tetraphenylporphyrin (MTPPS, M = Mn(III), Fe(III) and Co(III)) were synthesized and immobilized on cationically functionalised divinylbenzene(DVB)–crosslinked polystyrene(PS). These supported catalysts (PS-MTPPS) were found to exhibit peroxidase-like activity. The co-oxidation of 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol by H$_2$O$_2$ was attempted with these catalysts to mimic this enzyme function. The catalytic efficiency of all these immobilized MTPPS was found to be superior to the corresponding unsupported MTPPS in solution. The effect of the central metal ion of the porphyrin, $p$H of the reaction medium and also the temperature effect are investigated. The ideal  $p$H was seen to be in the 8 0–8 5 range, with maximum effect at 8 2. The efficiency order for the various PS-MTPPS was seen to be Co$&gt;$Mn$&gt;$Fe, with CoTPPS showing efficiency comparable to that of horseradish peroxidase. The catalytic efficiency was found to be increasing with temperature for all the catalysts. The re-usability of these PS-MTPPS systems for peroxidase-like activity was also studied and it was found that they exhibited a very high degree of recyclability without much poisoning.</p>

					<p>Synthesis, spectral and solution studies on 2-ethyl imidazolate-bridged (2-EtIm) homo-binuclear copper(II)–copper(II) and hetero-binuclear copper(II)–zinc(II) homologue are described. Magnetic moment values of homo-binuclear complexes indicate that the imidazolate group can mediate antiferromagnetic interactions. Optical spectra of hetero-binuclear complex at varying $p$H values suggest that the imidazolate-bridged complex is stable over the $p$H-range 7 15–10 0.</p>

				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0035-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc finger domains consist of sequences of amino acids containing cysteine and histidine residues tetrahedrally coordinated to a zinc ion. The role of zinc in a DNA binding finger was considered purely structural due to the absence of redox chemistry in zinc. However, whether other metals e.g. Co(II) or Cd(II) can substitute Zn(II) is not settled. For an answer the detailed interaction of Co(II) and Cd(II) with cysteine methylester and histidine methylester has been investigated as a model for the zinc  core in zinc fingers. The study was extended to different temperatures to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters associated with these interactions. The results suggest that zinc has a unique role.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of oxidation of five vicinal and four non-vicinal diols, and two of their monoethers by benzyltrimethylammonium tribromide (BTMAB) have been studied in 3:7 ($v/v$) acetic acid–water mixture. The vicinal diols yield the carbonyl compounds arising out of the glycol bond fission while the other diols give the hydroxycarbonyl compounds. The reaction is first-order with respect to BTMAB. Michaelis–Menten type kinetics is observed with respect to diol. Addition of benzyltrimethylammonium chloride does not affect the rate. Tribromide ion is postulated to be the reactive oxidizing species. Oxidation of [1,1,2,2-$^2$H$_4$] ethanediol shows the absence of a kinetic isotope effect. The reaction exhibits substantial solvent isotope effect. A mechanism involving a glycol-bond fission has been proposed for the oxidation of the vicinal diols. The other diols are oxidized by a hydride ion transfer to the oxidant, as are the monohydric alcohols.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements of D$_2$O solutions (0 1 M) of sodium cholate (NaC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) were carried out at $T$ = 298 K. Under compositions very much above the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the bile salt micelle size growths were monitored by adopting Hayter–Penfold type analysis of the scattering data. NaC and NaDC solutions show presence of correlation peaks at $Q$ = 0 12 and 0 1 Å$^{-1}$ respectively. Monodisperse ellipsoids of the micelles produce best fits. For NaC and NaDC systems, aggregation number (9 0, 16 0), fraction of the free counterions per micelle (0 79, 0 62), semi-minor (8 0 Å) and semi-major axes (18 4, 31 7 Å) values for the micelles were deduced. Extent of micellar growth was studied using ESR correlation time measurements on a suitable probe incorporating NaC and NaDC micelles. The growth parameter (axial ratio) values were found to be 2 3 and 4 0 for NaC and NaDC systems respectively. The values agree with those of SANS.</p>

					<p>Cupronickels offer enhanced corrosion protection in marine environments by the formation of passive films on the surface. Cyclic voltammetric studies were carried on cupronickels in chloride solutions at  $p$H 6 3 to understand the role of chloride ions in passive film formation. Increase in nickel content of the alloy and of chloride ions in solution decreases film resistance. Chloride ions take part in reduction of the passive film to copper.

				<page>0119-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spreading behaviour of the dimeric surfactant polyethyleneglycoldistearate (PEGDS) monolayer at air/water interface has been studied using surface pressure–area ( –$A$) isotherms as a function of temperature. The isotherms show a plateau suggesting a transition between a liquid expanded (LE) and a condensed state. The condensed state possibly arises due to nucleation and growth of multilayers from the monolayer. Isobaric measurements of both  $A–T$ and  $–T$ at constant area show transitions at $T = 295$ K. These plots suggest a melting followed by formation of condensed microcrystallites. Structure optimization carried out using various angles of orientation of the alkyl tails with respect to the backbone in PEGDS reveals tilt transitions of the tails in different states which can be related to the packing behaviour seen in the isotherms. Optical microscopy has been used to confirm the structures in these states.</p>

					<p>Multiphoton dissociation/ionization has been studied for CH$_3$SCH$_3$ at 355 and 532 nm using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The major ion signals observed at 355 nm are C$^+$, CH$_3^+$, HCS$^+$, CH$_2$S$^+$, CH$_3$S$^+^ and CH$_3$SCH$_3^+$. Power dependence studies at 355 nm show a  $(2 + 1)$ REMPI process for the formation of parent ion. Peaks at  $m/e = 46$, 47 and 61 show two-photon laser power dependence whereas $m/e = 15$ and 45 peaks show four-photon dependence. However, in 532 nm photoionisation, no parent ion signal is observed. A peak at $m/e = 35$ corresponding to SH$_3^+$ has been observed. SH$_3^+$ has been suggested to originate from CH$_3$SCH$_2^+$ via a cyclic transition state. Photoionisation results of CH$_3$SCH$_3$ have been compared with those of CH$_3$SSCH$_3$, at these two wavelengths.</p>

					<p>Oxidation of nine primary aliphatic alcohols by tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) in aqueous acetic acid leads to the formation of the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction is first order with respect to TBATB. Michaelis–Menten type kinetics is observed with respect to alcohols. The reaction failed to induce the polymerization of acrylonitrile. Tetrabutylammonium chloride has no effect on the reaction rate. The proposed reactive oxidizing species is the tribromide ion. The oxidation of [1,1-$^2$H$_2$]ethanol exhibits a substantial kinetic isotope effect. The effect of solvent composition indicates that the rate increases with increase in the polarity of the solvent. The reaction is susceptible to both polar and steric effects of substituents.

Brewster angle microscopic studies on monolayers of  {\bf I} and  {\bf II} at air/water interface showed formation of needle-like domains which seem to cluster faster in  {\bf I} than in {\bf II}. Atomic force microscopy  (AFM) studies also showed fairly uniform sized clusters in {\bf II} whereas in the case of {\bf I} they seem to show varying sizes. From the results it is concluded that  -elongation in the polar head groups leads to controlled cluster sizes in compound {\bf II} as compared to those in compound {\bf I}.</p>

				<title>TRANES analysis of the fluorescence of nile red in organized molecular assemblies confirms emission from two species</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0157-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-resolved area normalized emission spectroscopy (TRANES) is a new method for the analysis of fluorescence of dyes in complex chemical and biological systems (A S R Koti, M M G Krishna and N Periasamy, 2001,  \textit{J. Phys. Chem.} {\bf 105}, 1767). The model-free method extends the power of time-resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) analysis and removes the ambiguity in the interpretation when the emission spectrum is time-dependent. Observation of an isoemissive point in TRANES analysis of fluorescence is an unambiguous indication for the presence of two emissive species in the sample. The isoemissive point occurs at a wavelength where the ratio of the radiative rates of the two species is equal to the ratio of their total radiative rates. The polarity-sensitive nile red dye shows timedependent emission spectra in the organized bilayer assemblies of TX micelle and bilayer egg-phosphotidylcholine (egg-PC) membrane. Time-dependent spectra in complex systems support many important models (solvation model and heterogeneity in the ground and/or excited state). TRANES analysis shows that the fluorescence emission of nile red in TX micelle and egg-PC membrane is due to two emissive species solubilized in different sites.</p>

The complexes have been isolated as their perchlorate salts. The N,N chelators are 1-alkyl-2-(phenylazo)imidazoles (PaiX, X = Me, Et, CH$_2$Ph); 2-(arylazo)pyridines, (Raap,  $p$-R-C$_6$H$_4$–N=N–C$_5$H$_4$N; R = H, Me, Cl); 2-(arylazo)pyrimidines (Raapm,  $p$-R–C$_6$H$_4$–N=N–C$_3$N$_2$H$_2$; R = H, Me, Cl); 2,2 -bipyridine (bpy) and 1,10-phenanthroline ($o$-phen). Unsymmetrical N,N chelators may give two isomers and this is indeed observed. The ${}^1$H NMR spectral data refer to the presence of two isomers in the mixture in different proportions. With consideration of coordination pairs in the order of PPh$_3$, PPh$_3$; N,N (N refers to N(immidazole)) and N ,N (N refers to N(azo)), the complexes have been characterised as  \textit{trans-cis-cis}  and \textit{trans-trans-trans} configuration; the former predominates in the mixture. Electrochemical studies exhibit high potential Ru(III)/Ru(II) couple and quasireversible N=N reduction. Electronic spectra show high intensity ( 10$^4$) MLCT transition in the visible region (520 $\pm$ 10) nm alongwith a shoulder ( 10$^3$) in the longer wavelength region.</p>

					<p>Neutral tetradentate N$_2$O$_2$ type complexes of Cu(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), Zn(II) and VO(II) have been synthesised using a Schiff base formed by the condensation of $o$-phenylenediamine with acetoacetanilide in alcohol medium. All the  complexes were characterised on the basis of their microanalytical data, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, IR, UV–Vis ${}^1$H NMR and ESR spectra. IR and UV–Vis spectral data suggest that all the complexes are square-planar except the Mn(II) and VO(II) chelates, which are of octahedral and square pyramidal geometry respectively. The monomeric and neutral nature of the complexes was confirmed by their magnetic susceptibility data and low conductance values. The ESR spectra of copper and vanadyl complexes in DMSO solution at 300 K and 77 K were recorded and their salient features are reported.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Excess molar volumes ($V^E_m$) and viscosities ( ) of the binary mixtures of 1,2-diethoxyethane with di-, tri- and tetrachloromethane have been measured at 298 15 K and atmospheric pressure over the entire mole fraction range. The deviations in viscosities ( ln ) and excess energies of activation ( $G^{*E}$) for viscous flow have been calculated from the experimental data. The Prigogine–Flory–Patterson (PFP) model has been used to calculate $V^E_m$, and the results have been compared with experimental data. The Bloomfield and Dewan model has been used to calculate viscosity coefficients and these have also been compared with experimental data for the three mixtures. The results have been discussed in terms of dipole–dipole interactions between 1,2-diethoxyethane and chloroalkanes and their magnitudes decreasing with the dipole character of the molecules. A short comparative study with results for mixtures with polyethers and chloroalkanes is also described.</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0235-0244</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser-induced fluorescence excitation and IR–UV double resonance spectroscopy have been used to determine the hydrogen-bonded structure of benzyl alcohol–ammonia (1:1) cluster in a jet-cooled molecular beam. In addition, $ab$ \textit{initio} quantum chemical calculations have been performed at HF/6-31G and HF/6-31G(d, p) levels for different ground state equilibrium structures of the cluster to correlate the calculated OH and NH frequencies and their intensities with experimental results. The broad red-shifted OH-stretching mode in the IR–UV double resonance spectrum suggests strong hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl hydrogen and the lone pair of the ammonia nitrogen. The position and intensity distribution of the calculated NH and OH modes for the minimum-energy gauche form at HF/6-31$G$ level have better correlation with the experimental results compared to other calculated ground state equilibrium conformers. These results lead to the conclusion that the minimum energy gauche form of the cluster is populated in the jet-cooled condition.</p>

					<p>Preparation of the ligands HL$^1$= 2,6-[(N-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-$p$-ethylphenol; HL$^2$ = 2,6-[(N-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-$p$-methoxyphenol and HL$^3$ = 2,6-[(N-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-$p$-nitrophenol are described together with their Cu(II) complexes with different bridging units.

Both the ligands and complexes were characterized by spectral studies. Cyclic voltammetric investigation of these complexes revealed that the reaction process involves two successive quasireversible one-electron steps at different potentials. The first reduction potential is sensitive to electronic effects of the substituents at the aromatic ring of the ligand system, shifting to positive potentials when the substituents are replaced by more electrophilic groups. EPR studies indicate very weak interaction between the two copper atoms. Various covalency parameters have been calculated.</p>

				<title>Theoretical study of the mechanism of proton transfer in tautomeric systems: Alloxan</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0297-0306</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Semiempirical SCF-MO studies of tautomerism in alloxan preclude the possibility of direct proton transfer in the gas phase due to the strain in the four-centred transition state, in which the proton being transferred is forced to come close to the positively charged carbon atom at the opposite corner of the four-membered ring. However, in aqueous solution, the activation barrier reduces appreciably, not only due to reduction in strain, but also due to charge separation in the transition state, which is stabilized due to ionic resonance. The N–H bond is almost broken, while the O–H bond is only partially formed in the transition state. The other stabilizing effect in aqueous solution is due to bulk solvent dielectric effects, which stabilize the transition state to a greater extent due to its higher dipole moment. Although the transition states for proton transfer to the neighbouring oxygen atoms on either side have comparable energies, as the mechanisms of proton transfer leading to the formation of the 2-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy tautomers are similar, bulk solvent effects are larger in the latter due to the higher dipole moment of the transition state. The reason is the almost complete separation of the two entities, i.e. the alloxan anion and the hydronium ion in the latter case, indicating that in this case a dissociative mechanism of the kind encountered in acid–base equilibria is operating.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Detailed X-ray crystallographic investigation of the reactive - and the unreactive -polymorphs of  $o$-ethoxy cinnamic acid has been carried out along with that of the photodimer,  -truxillic acid. The molecule is quite planar in the -form, but in the  -form, the side groups deviate significantly from the plane of the benzene ring.  The carboxylic groups form normal cyclic hydrogen bonds in the  -form and near-symmetric hydrogen bonds in the  -form. The infrared spectrum of the  -form shows the characteristic features of the cyclic dimer, but that of the  -form is entirely different, marked by the absence of the O–H stretching band in the 3000 cm$^{-1}$ region. Charge density analysis throws some light on the structure and reactivity of the molecule in the two forms. The near-symmetric hydrogen bond in the  -form is ionic and appears to restrict conjugation by way of distorting the molecule. This unusual feature keeps the cinnamoyl double bonds away from each other, rendering it photochemically unreactive. In the  -form, however, the double bonds have a closer approach. The cyclobutyl ring of the photodimer consists of weak single bonds, with the new pair being slightly longer</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of oxidation of acidic amino acids (glutamic acid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp)) by sodium N-bromobenzenesulphonamide (bromamine-B or BAB) has been carried out in aqueous HClO$_4$ medium at 30$^\circ$C. The rate shows firstorder dependence each on [BAB]$_o$ and [amino acid]$_o$ and inverse first-order on [H$^+$]. At [H$^+$] $&gt;$ 0 60 mol dm$^{-3}$, the rate levelled off indicating zero-order dependence on [H$^+$] and, under these conditions, the rate has fractional order dependence on [amino acid]. Succinic and malonic acids have been identified as the products. Variation of ionic strength and addition of the reaction product benzenesulphonamide or halide ions had no significant effect on the reaction rate. There is positive effect of dielectric constant of the solvent. Proton inventory studies in H$_2$O–D$_2$O mixtures showed the involvement of a single exchangeable proton of the OH$^-$ ion in the transition state. Kinetic investigations have revealed that the order of reactivity is Asp $&gt;$ Glu. The rate laws proposed and derived in agreement with experimental results are discussed.</p>

				<title>Basic building units, self-assembly and crystallization in the formation of complex inorganic open architectures</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0363-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Careful investigations of open-framework metal phosphates reveal that the formation of these complex architectures is likely to involve a process wherein one-dimensional ladders or chains, and possibly zero-dimens ional  monomers, transform to higher dimensional structures. The one-dimensional ladder appears to be the primary building unit of these structures. At one stage of the building-up process, spontaneous self-assembly of a low-dimensional structure such as the ladder seems to occur, followed by crys tallization of a two- or  three-dimensional structure.  Accordingly, many of the higher dimensional structures retain the structural features of the 1D structure, indicating the occurrence of self-assembly. These findings mark the beginnings of our understan ding of complex supramolecular inorganic materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis and characterization of nanotubes and nanowires constitute an important part of nanoscience  since these materials are essential bui lding units for several devices. We have prepared aligned  carbon nanotube bundles and Y-junction nanotubes by the pyrolysis of appropriate organic precursors. The aligned bundles are useful for field  emission display while the Y-junction nanotubes are likely to be useful as nanochips since they exhibit diode properties at the junction. By making use of carbon nanotubes, nanowires of metals, metal oxides and GaN have be en obt a ined. Both the oxide and GaN nanowires are single crystalline. Gold nanowires exhibit plasmon bands varying markedly with the aspect ratio. GaN nanowires show excellent photoluminescence characteristics. It has been possible to synthesise nanotubes and nanowires of metal chalcogenides by employing different strategies.</p>

				<title>Relaxation in binary mixtures: Non-ideality, heterogeneity and re-entrance</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0393-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Binary mixtures show many kinds of fascinating dynamical behaviour which has eluded microscopic description till very recently. In this work we show that much of the anomalous behaviour can be explained by building suitable models and  carrying out theoretical and simulation studies. Specifically, three well-known problems have been addressed here. (a) Non-ideality in composition dependence of viscosity, (b) re-entrant behaviour of orientational relaxation, and (c) heterogeneity in supercooled binary mixtures. The physical origin of the dynamical behaviour of binary mixtures can be understood in terms of composition fluctuation, a study of which has also been presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Electron–electron interactions in the chemical bond: ``1/3” Effect in the bond length of hydrogen molecule</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0415-0425</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The  prominent  ``1/3”  effect  observed in the Hall effect plateaus of twodimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems has been postulated to indicating 1/3 fractional charge quasiparticle excitations arising from electron–electron interactions. Tunneling shot-noise experiments on 2DEF exhibiting fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) shows evidence for tunnelling of particles with $e$ and  $e/3$ charges for a constant band mass. A "1/3” effect in the hydrogen molecule is seen in as much as its internuclear distance, $d_{H-H} = D^- + D^+,$ with $|D^+/D^-| = 1/3$. This is examined in terms of electron–electron interactions involving electron- and hole quasiparticles, ($e^-$) and ($h^+$), equivalent to those observed in FQHE shot-noise experiments. The ($e/m$) ratio of the ($e^-$) and ($h^+$) quasiparticles is kept at 1: –3. Instead of a 2DEG, these particles are treated as being in flat Bohr orbits. A treatment in the language of charge-flux tube composites for the hydrogen atom as well as the hydrogen molecule is attempted. Such  treatment  gives important insights into changes in chemical potential and bond energy on crossing a phase boundary during the atom-bond transition as well as on models for FQHE itself.</p>

					<p>Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a unique method to obtain epitaxial multi-component oxide films. Highly stoichiometric, nearly single crystal-like materials in the form of films can be made by PLD. Oxides which are synthesized at  high oxygen pressure  can be made into films at low oxygen partial pressure. Epitaxial thin films of high  $T_c$ cuprates, metallic, ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, dielectric oxides, super conduc tor–metal–superconductor Josephson junctions and oxide superlattices have been made by PLD. In this article, an overview of preparation, characterization and properties of epitaxial oxide films and their applications are presented. Future prospects of the method for fabricating epitaxial films of transition metal nitrides, chalcogenides, carbides and borides are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>One of the fascinating fields of study in magnetism in recent years has been the study of quantum phenomena in nanosystems. While semiconductor structures have provided paradigms of nanosystems from the stand point of electronic phenomena,  the synthesis of high nuclearity transition metal complexes have provided examples of nano magnets. The range and diversity of the properties exhibited by these systems rivals its electronic counterparts. Qualitative understanding of these phenomena requires only a knowledge of basic physics, but quantitative study throws up many challenges that are similar to those encountered in the study of correlated electronic systems. In this article, a brief overview of the current trends in this area are highlighted and some of the efforts of our group in developing a quantitative understanding of this field are outlined.</p>

				<page>0487-0496</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this mini-review, I discuss some recent work on the stereochemistry and bonding of lone pairs of electrons in divalent compounds of the heavier carbon group elements  (Sn$^{II}$, Pb$^{II}$) and in trivalent compounds of the heavier nitrogen group elements (Bi$^{III}$). Recently developed methods that permit the real-space visualization of bonding patterns on the basis of density functional calculations of electronic  structure, reveal details of the nature of selectron lone pairs in compounds of the heavier main group elements – their stereochemistry and their inertness (or lack thereof). An examination of  tetragonal $P4/nmm$ SnO, $\alpha$-PbO  and BiOF, and cubic  $Fm3m$ PbS provides a segue into perovskite phases of technological significance, including ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ and antiferroelectric/piezoelectric PbZrO$_3$, in both of which the lone  pairs on Pb atoms play a pivotal rôle.</p>

					<p>Structures of NASICON glasses of the general formula AB$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$, where A = Li, Na or K and B = Fe, Ga, Ti, V or Nb, have been investigated using vibrational (IR and Raman) spectroscopies. Phosphate species appear to establish an equilibrium via a disproportionation reaction involving a dynamical bond-switching mechanism where both charge and bonds are conserved. B ions in the system acquire different coordinations to oxygens. Alkali ions cause absorptions due to cage vibrations. All the observed spectroscopic features are consistent with speciation involving disproportionation reactions.</p>

				<title>Hydrocarbon chain conformation in an intercalated surfactant monolayer and bilayer</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0539-0558</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cetyl trimethyl ammonium (CTA) ions have been confined within galleries of layered CdPS$_3$ at two different grafting densities. Low grafting densities are obtained on direct intercalation of CTA ions into CdPS$_3$ to give Cd$_{0 \cdot 93}$PS$_3$(CTA)$_{0 \cdot 14}$. Intercalation occurs with a lattice expansion of $4\codt 8$ Å with the interlamellar surfactant ion lying flat forming a monolayer. Intercalation at higher grafting densities was effected by a two-step ion-exchange process to give Cd$_{0 \cdot 83}$PS$_3$(CTA)$_{0 \cdot 34}$, with a lattice expansion of $26 \cdot 5$ Å. At higher grafting densities the interlamellar surfactant ions adopt a tilted bilayer structure. ${}^{13}$C NMR and orientation-dependent IR vibrational spectroscopy on single crystals have been used to probe the conformation and orientation of the methylene ‘tail’ of the intercalated surfactant in the two phases. In the monolayer phase, the confined methylene chain adopts an essentially all-trans conformation with most of the trans chain aligned parallel to the gallery walls. On lowering the temperature, molecular plane aligns parallel, so that the methylene chain lies flat, rigid and aligned to the confining surface. In the bilayer phase, most bonds in the methylene chain are in trans conformation. It is possible to identify specific conformational sequences containing a gauche bond, in the interior and termini of the intercalated methylene. These high energy conformers disappear on cooling leaving all fifteen methylene units of the intercalated cetyl trimethyl ammonium ion in trans conformational registry at 40 K.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Diffusion of monatomic guest species within confined media has been understood to a good degree due to investigations carried out during the past decade and a half. Most guest species that are of industrial relevance are actually polyatomics such as, for example, hydrocarbons in zeolites. We attempt to investigate the influence of non-spherical nature of guest species on diffusion. Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of motion of methane in NaCaA and NaY, benzene in NaY and one-dimensional channels AlPO$_4$-5, VPI-5 and carbon nanotube indicate interesting insights into the influence of the host on rotational degrees of freedom and rientational properties. It is shown that benzene in one-dimensional channels where the levitation parameter is near unity exhibits translational motion opposite to what is expected on the basis of molecular anisotropy. Rotational motion of benzene also possesses rotational diffusivities around C$_6$ and $C_2$ axes opposite to what is expected on the basis of molecular geometry. Methane shows orientational preference for $2 +2$ or $1 + 3$ depending on the magnitude of the levitation parameter.</p>

				<title>Computer simulation study of water using a fluctuating charge model</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0579-0590</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogen bonding in small water clusters is studied through computer simulation methods using a sophisticated, empirical model of interaction developed by Rick \textit{et al} (S W Rick, S J Stuart and B J Berne 1994 \textit{J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 101} 6141) and others. The model allows for the charges on the interacting sites to fluctuate as a function of time, depending on their local environment. The charge flow is driven by the difference in the electronegativity of the atoms within the water molecule, thus effectively mimicking the effects of polarization of the charge density. The potential model is thus transferable across all phases of water. Using this model, we have obtained the minimum energy structures of water clusters up to a size of ten. The cluster structures agree well with experimental data. In addition, we are able to distinctly identify the hydrogens that form hydrogen bonds based on their charges alone, a feature that is not possible in simulations using fixed charge models. We have also studied the structure of liquid water at ambient conditions using this fluctuating charge model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water at 298 and 258 K to investigate the effects of hydrogen-bond environment on various single-particle and pair dynamical properties of water molecules at ambient and supercooled conditions. The water molecules are modelled by the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model. We first calculate the distribution of hydrogen-bond environment in liquid water at both temperatures and then investigate how the selfdiffusion and orientational relaxation of a single water molecule and also the relative diffusion and relaxation of the hydrogen-bond of a water pair depend on the nature of the hydrogen-bond environment of the tagged molecules. We find that the various dynamical quantities depend significantly on the hydrogen-bond environment, especially at the supercooled temperature. The present study provides a molecular-level insight into the dynamics of liquid water under ambient and supercooled conditions.</p>

					<p>MgNb$_{2–x}$Ta$_x$O$_6$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2$) phases can be obtained as the major phase (75 to 90$&#37;$) by solid state reactions starting from oxides. These oxides crystallize in the orthorhombic columbite structure till $x = 1 \cdot 75$ and the tetragonal trirutile structure for MgTa$_2$O$_6$ ($x = 2 \cdot 0$). For all the compositions there exist secondary phases like Nb$_2$O$_5$ or Ta$_2$O$_5$ in addition to the major AB$_2$O$_6$ phase. Sintered disks (1200$\circ$C) show dielectric constants varying between 14$\cdot$8 and 16$\cdot$0 for the entire range of composition at a frequency of 500 kHz. The dielectric loss is nearly constant around 0$\cdot$025 to 0$\cdot$03 between $0 \leq x \leq 1$ but increases to 0$\cdot$17 for the MgTa$_2$O$_6$ phase ($x = 2\cdot 0$). Scanning electron micrographs reveal a gradual decrease in grain size with increase in Ta concentration with a size of 3 micron for the $x=0$ composition (sintered at 1200$^\circ$C) while the $x = 2$ phase shows a grain size of approximately 0$\cdot$5 microns. The microwave dielectric constant at $\sim$14 GHz is found to be 20$\cdot$9 for the $x = 0$ composition and $17 \cdot 7$ for the $x = 2$ composition.</p>

The thiolates adopt an unusual bilayered lamellar structure, whose thickness is governed by the length of the alkyl chain.

					<p>Molybdenum disilicide is a high temperature structural ceramic with many attractive properties for engineering applications. Foremost amongst these is its stability in corrosive atmospheres up to about 1600$^\circ$C. However, there are a few undesirable properties that need to be addressed before it can become a viable material in high temperature applications. Since MoSi$_2$ forms thermodynamically stable composites with both metals and ceramics, many reinforcing materials are incorporated into the matrix to improve the fracture toughness and creep properties. The low temperature oxidation can be controlled by making high density ($&gt;$ 95&#37; of theoretical density) compacts. This article summarizes the important attempts that are made in improving the properties of molybdenum disilicide-based ceramics by the reinforcement with other materials.</p>

					<p>A series of ceria-incorporated zirconia (Ce$_{1-x}$Zr$_x$O$_2$, $x = 0$ to 1) solid solutions were prepared by employing the solution combustion synthesis route. The products were characterized by XRD and UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The materials are crystalline in nature and the lattice parameters of the solid solution series follow Vegard’s law. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the solid solutions in the UV region show two intense bands at 250 and 297 nm which are assigned respectively to Ce$^{3+} \leftarrow$ O$^{2-}$ and Ce$^{4+} \leftarrow $ O$^{2-}$ charge transfer transitions. The two vibrational bands in 6960 cm$^{-1}$ and 5168 cm$^{-1}$ in the NIR region indicate the presence of surface hydroxyl groups on these materials.</p>

				<title>Applications of self-assembled monolayers in materials chemistry</title>
				<feature>Solid State and Materials Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0659-0670</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Self-assembly provides a simple route to organise suitable organic molecules on noble metal and selected nanocluster surfaces by using monolayers of long chain organic molecules with various functionalities like –SH, –COOH, –NH$_2$, silanes etc. These surfaces can be effectively used to build-up interesting nano level architectures. Flexibility with respect to the terminal functionalities of the organic molecules allows the control of the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of metal surface, while the selection of length scale can be used to tune the distant-dependent electron transfer behaviour. Organo-inorganic materials tailored in this fashion are extremely important in nanotechnology to construct nanoelctronic devices, sensor arrays, supercapacitors, catalysts, rechargeable power sources etc. by virtue of their size and shape-dependent electrical, optical or magnetic properties. The interesting applications of monolayers and monolayer-protected clusters in materials chemistry are discussed using recent examples of size and shape control of the properties of several metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles. The potential benefits of using these nanostructured systems for molecular electronic components are illustrated using Au and Ag nanoclusters with suitable bifunctional SAMs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Together with hydrotalcite-like layered double hydroxides, bivalent and trivalent metal hydroxides and their hydroxy salts are actually anionic clays consisting of positively charged hydroxide layers with anions intercalated in the interlayer region. The anionic clays exhibit anion sorption, anion diffusion and exchange properties together with surface basicity making them materials of importance for many modern applications. In this article, we discuss many different ways of making anionic clays and compare and contrast the rich diversity of this class of materials with the better-known cationic clays.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Equilibria of the axial ligation of benzyl(aquo)cobaloximes by imidazole, 1-methyl imidazole, histidine, histamine, glycine, ethyl glycine ester, thiourea and urea have been spectrophotometrically measured in aqueous solutions of ionic strength $1\cdot 0$ M (KCl) at 25$^\circ$C as a function of $p$H. The equilibrium constants are in the order CN$^- &gt;$ 1-methyl imidazole $&gt;$ imidazole $&gt;$ histidine $&gt;$ histamine $&gt;$glycine $&gt;$ethyl glycine ester $&gt;$ thiourea $&gt;$ urea. The order of stability of benzyl(ligand)cobaloxime is explained based on the basicity of the ligand, Co(III) $\rightarrow L d\pi–p\pi$ back bonding and soft–soft and soft–hard interaction. Imidazole, substituted imidazoles, histidine and histamine form more stable complexes than glycine, ethyl glycine ester in contrast to the basicity of the ligands. Benzyl(ligand)cobaloximes were isolated and characterized by elemental analysis, IR and ${}^1$H NMR spectra.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Equilibria and kinetics of the reaction of bromomethyl(aquo) cobaloxime with histamine, histidine, glycine and ethyl glycine ester and iodomethyl(aquo) cobaloxime with cyanide, imidazole and substituted imidazoles were studied as a function of $p$H at 25$\circ$C, $1 \cdot 0$ M ionic strength (KCl) by spectrophotometry technique. The rate of substitution of H$_2$O varies with the $pKa$ of the incoming ligand, thus establishing the existence of nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. Dissociation kinetic reactions were also studied as a function of $p$H. Binding and kinetic data were interpreted based on the basicity, steric crowd of the entering ligand and HSAB principle. To compare the rate constants of the entering ligands $p$H independent second-order rate constants were calculated.</p>

				<title>Dipicolinate complexes of main group metals with hydraziniumcation</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical </feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Some new coordination complexes of hydrazinium main group metal dipicolinate hydrates of formulae (N$_2$H$_5$)2M(dip)$_2.n$H$_2$O (where, M = Ca, Sr, Ba or Pb and $n = 0, 2, 4$ and 3 respectively and dip = dipicolinate), N$_2$H$_5$Bi(dip)$_2.3$H$_2$O and (N$_2$H$_5$)$_3$Bi(dip)$_3.4$H$_2$O have been prepared and characterized by physico-chemical techniques. The infrared spectra of the complexes reveal the presence of tridentate dipicolinate dianions and non-coordinating hydrazinium cations. Conductance measurements show that the mono, di and trihydrazinium complexes behave as 1 : 1, 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 electrolytes respectively, in aqueous solution. Thermal decomposition studies show that these compounds lose water followed by endothermic decomposition of hydrazine to give respective metal hydrogendipicolinate intermediates, which further decompose exothermically to the final product of either metal carbonates (Ca, Sr, Ba and Pb) or metal oxycarbonates (Bi). The coordination numbers around the metal ions differ from compound to compound. The various coordination numbers exhibited by these metals are six (Ca), seven (Ba), eight (Sr) and nine (Pb and Bi). In all the complexes the above coordination number is attained by tridentate dipicolinate dianions and water molecules. The X-ray diffraction patterns of these compounds differ from one another suggesting that they are not isomorphous.</p>

				<title>Lifetimes of $\alpha$-halo and $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations in aqueous solution</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0047-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The title cations were produced in aqueous solution by chemical initiation (solvolysis) of benzyl-\textit{gem}-dihalides and benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides. The solvolysis reactions of benzyl-\textit{gem}-dihalides and benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides in water proceed by a stepwise mechanism through $\alpha$-halobenzyl carbocation and $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocation intermediates, which are captured by water to give the corresponding carbonyl compounds as the sole detectable products. Rate constant ratio $k_x/k_s (M${-1}$) for partitioning of the carbocation between reaction with halide/azide ion and reaction with water is determined by analysis of halide/azide common ion inhibition of the solvolysis reaction. The rate constants k$_s$(s^{-1}$) for the reaction of the cation with solvent water were determined from the experimental values of $k_x/k_s$ and $k_{solv}$, for the solvolysis of the benzyl-\textit{gem}-dihalides and benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides respectively, using $k_x = 5 \tiems 10^9$ M$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ for diffusion-limited reaction of halide/azide ion with $\alpha$-substituted benzyl carbocations. The values of 1$/k_s$ are thus the lifetimes of the $\alpha$-halobenzyl carbocations and $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations respectively.</p>

				<title>Partitioning of methyl internal rotational barrier energy of thioacetaldehyde</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0061-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nature of methyl internal rotational barrier in thioacetaldehyde has been investigated by relaxation effect, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and Pauling exchange interactions. The true experimental barrier can be obtained by considering fully relaxed rotation. Nuclear-electron attraction term is a barrier forming term in the fully relaxed rotation, but it appears as an antibarrier for rigid rotation. It is seen that during methyl rotation, the torsional mode is coupled with the aldehydic hydrogen out-of-plane wagging motion. Natural bond orbital analysis shows that the principal barrier forming term originates from the C–C bond. The lengthening of the C–C bond is explained by considering charge transfer interaction between several bonding and antibonding orbitals in the C–C bond region, which leads to higher bonding overlap for the eclipsed conformer compared to the staggered conformer. S–C($\sigma$)/C$_{\text{me}}$–H$_{\text{ip}}$ and C–H$_{\text{ald}}$/C$_{\text{me}}–H$_{\text{op}}$ interactions appear to be the main barrier-forming Pauling exchange terms but have less contribution to make to the barrier compared to the C–C bond interaction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photoisomerization of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in a polymer–surfactant aggregate is studied using picosecond time resolved emission spectroscopy. The aggregate consists of the polymer, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and the surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). With increase in the concentration of SDS in an aqueous solution of MC540 containing PVP, the emission quantum yield and lifetime of MC540 increase markedly. This indicates marked retardation in the nonradiative photoisomerization process of MC540, when it binds to the polymersurfactant aggregate. The critical association concentration of SDS for binding to PVP has been found to be 0$\cdot$5 mM. This is about 16 times lower than the CMC of SDS in pure water (8 mM).</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0137-0148</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of 34 organic sulphides by $2,2'$-bipyridinium chlorochromate (BPCC) resulted in the formation of the corresponding sulphoxides. The reaction is first order with respect to both BPCC and the sulphide, and is catalysed by hydrogen ions. The hydrogen-ion dependence has the form: $k_{\text{obs}} = a+b$[H$^{+}$]. The oxidation was studied in 19 different organic solvents. An analysis of the solvent effect by Swain’s equation showed that the both cation- and anion-solvating powers of the solvents play important roles. The rates of oxidation meta- and $p$-substituted phenyl methyl sulphides were correlated with Charton’s LDR equation. The rates of the $o$-compounds showed excellent correlation with the LDRS equation. Oxidation of the $p$-compounds is more susceptible to the delocalization effect. Oxidation of the $m$-compounds exhibited a greater dependence on the field effect. In the oxidation of the $o$-compounds, the contribution of delocalized effect is slightly more than that of the field effect. The oxidation of alkyl phenyl sulphides is subject to both polar and steric effects of the alkyl groups. Polar reaction constants are negative, indicating an electron-deficient sulphur centre in the rate-determining step. A mechanism involving formation of a sulphurane intermediate in the slow step has been proposed.</p>

Different rate laws are operative under these three conditions though HOBr is the effective oxidizing species in all the cases. A mechanism involving an intermediate four-membered cyclic transition state between DMSO and HOBr (formation constant $K$), which decomposes in a slow step with a rate constant ($k$) has been proposed. Thermodynamic parameters for the adduct formation step and activation parameters for the first-order decomposition of the adduct step have been evaluated in the temperature range 308–323 K. Activation parameters have also been determined while the orders in [DMSO] are unity and zero. The reaction product has been identified as dimethyl sulphone (DMSO$_2$).</p>

				<title>Effects of preparation temperature on the conductivity of polypyrrole conducting polymer</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0155-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An attempt has been made to investigate the effect of temperature on the conductivity of polypyrrole conducting polymer films prepared by an electrochemical method in an aqueous medium using camphor sulfonate as the dopant. The polymer was grown from aqueous solutions employing a range of temperatures (1–60$^\circ$C). It was found that with increase in temperature the conductivity decreased and the optimum temperature was found to be between 10 and 30$^\circ$C. The results show that the polymer formed at low temperature has higher conductivity and is stronger than that formed at higher temperatures. Characterization by X-ray scattering shows that interlayer distance, $d_{\text{Bragg}}$ (Å), increases with increasing temperature. The morphology of the films formed was studied by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The changes in conductivity and physical appearance were interpreted as being due to compactness in the molecular packing and formation of $\alpha \beta$ linkages in the film.</p>

					<p>Equilibrium study of the mixed ligand complex formation of Fe$^{\text{III}}$ with boric acid in the absence and in the presence of $2,2'$-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, diethylenetriamine and triethylenetetramine (L) in different molar ratios provides evidence of formation of Fe(OH)$^{2+}$, Fe(OH)$^+_2$, Fe(L)$^{3+}$, Fe(H$_2$BO$_4$), Fe(OH)(H$_2$BO$_4$)$^-$, Fe(OH)$_2$(H$_2$BO$_4$)$^{2-}$, Fe(L)(H$_2$BO$_4$) and Fe$_2$(L)$_2$(BO$_4$)$^+$ complexes.

				<page>0203-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The alkylation of ethylbenzene with $t$-butyl alcohol was studied over Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al = 50 and 90) and Al, Mg-MCM-41 (Si/(Al $+$ Mg) =50) in the vapour phase from 200 to 400$^\circ$C. The products were $p-t$-butylethylbenzene ($p-t$-BEB), $p-t$-butylvinylbenzene ($p-t$-BVB) and $m-t$-butylethylbenzene ($m-t$-BEB). Ethylbenzene conversion decreased with increase in temperature and increase in the ethylbenzene content of the feed. The reaction between the freely diffusing ethylbenzene in the channel and the $t$-butyl cations remaining as charge compensating ions yielded $p-t$-BEB. $p-t$-BVB, an unexpected product in this investigation, was produced by dehydrogenation of $p-t$-BEB over alumina particles present in the channels of the molecular sieves. Adsorption of ethylbenzene on Brønsted acid sites and its subsequent reaction with very closely adsorbed $t$-butyl cations proved to be necessary to obtain $m-t$-BEB. Though $m-t$-BEB was obtained, the corresponding $m-t$-butylvinylbenzene was not observed in this study. Study of time durations indicated rapid and slow catalyst deactivation at lower and higher streams respectively.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0233-0246</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The diphosphazane ligands of the type, (C$_{20}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)PN(R)P(E)Y$_2$ (R = CHMe$_2$ or ($S$)-$^\ast$CHMePh; E = lone pair or S; Y$_2$ = O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$ or Y = OC$_6$H$_5$ or OC$_6$H$_4$Me-4 or OC$_6$H$_4$OMe-4 or OC$_6$H$_4$Bu$^t$-4 or C$_6$H$_5$) bearing axially chiral $1,1'$-binaphthyl-$2,2'$-dioxy moiety have been synthesised. The structure and absolute configuration of a diastereomeric palladium complex, [PdCl$_2\{\eta^2$-((O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$)PN(($S$)-$^\ast$CHMePh)PPh$_2 \}$] has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The reactions of [CpRu(PPh$_3$)$_2$Cl] with various symmetrical and unsymmetrical diphosphazanes of the type, X$_2$PN(R)PYY' (R = CHMe$_2$ or ($S$)-$^\ast$CHMePh; X = C$_6$H$_5$ or X$_2$ = O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$; Y = Y' = C$_6$H$_5$ or Y = C$_6$H$_5$, Y' = OC$_6$H$_4$Me-4 or OC$_6$H$_3$Me$_2$-3,5 or N$_2$C$_3$HMe$_2$-3,5) yield several diastereomeric neutral or cationic half-sandwich ruthenium complexes which contain a stereogenic metal center. In one case, the absolute configuration of a trichiral ruthenium complex, viz. [Cp$^\ast$Ru$\{\eta^2$-Ph$_2$PN(($S$)-$^\ast$CHMePh)$^\ast$PPh (N$_2$C$_3$HMe$_2$-3,5)}Cl] is established by X-ray diffraction. The reactions of Ru$_3$(CO)$_{12}$ with the diphosphazanes (C$_{20}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)PN(R)PY$_2$ (R = CHMe$_2$ or Me; Y$_2$=O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$ or Y = OC$_6$H$_5$ or OC$_6$H$_4$Me-4 or OC6H4OMe-4 or OC$_6$H$_4$Bu$^t$-4 or C$_6$H$_5$) yield the triruthenium clusters [Ru$_3$(CO)$_{10}\{\eta-(O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$)PN(R)PY$_2\}$], in which the diphosphazane ligand bridges two metal centres. Palladium allyl chemistry of some of these chiral ligands has been investigated. The structures of isomeric $\eta^3$-allyl palladium complexes, [Pd($\eta^3$-1,3-R'$_2$-C$_3$H$_3$)$\{\eta^2-($rac$)-(O$_2$C$_{20}$H$_{12}$)PN(CHMe$_2$)PY$_2\}$](PF$_6$) (R' = Me or Ph; Y = C$_6$H$_5$ or OC$_6$H$_5$) have been elucidated by high field twodimensional NMR spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic studies.</p>

				<title>Bending crystals. Solid state photomechanical properties of transition metal complexes containing semiquinonate ligands</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0247-0254</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The properties of transition metal complexes containing catecholate and radical semiquinonate ligands have often been found to be unusual and unexpected. Crystals of Rh(CO)$_2$(3,6-DBSQ), containing the 3,6-di-\textit{tert}-butyl-1,2-semiquinonate ligand, form as long thin needles that are observed to bend reversibly upon irradiation with NIR light. Crystallographic characterization reveals a stacked solid state lattice with planar molecules aligned with metal atoms atop one another. Electronic spectra recorded in the solid state and in solution show an intense band at 1600 nm that maps the energy dependence of crystal bend angle. The transition is a property of the stacked assembly, rather than of an individual complex molecule, and appears associated with an MLCT process that transfers charge from an antibonding band formed by interacting Rh $d_z^2$ orbitals to the vacant quinone $\pi^\ast$ orbital. Related observations have been made on the [Co($\mu$-pyz)(3,6-DBSQ)(3,6-DBCat)]$_n$ polymer. Photomechanical properties appear associated with electronic transitions that lead to a physical change in axial length of a linear polymer, coupled with a soft solid state lattice that permits axial contraction/expansion without crystal fracture.</p>

				<title>Thiosemicarbazone complexes of the platinum metals. A story of variable coordination modes</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (H2saltsc) reacts with [M(PPh$_3$)$_3$X$_2$] (M = Ru, Os; X = Cl, Br) to afford complexes of type [M(PPh$_3$)$_2$(Hsaltsc)$_2$], in which the salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone ligand is coordinated to the metal as a bidentate N,S-donor forming a four-membered chelate ring. Reaction of benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazones (Hbztsc-R) with [M(PPh$_3$)$_3$X$_2$] also affords complexes of similar type, viz. [M(PPh$_3$)$_2$(bztsc-R)$_2$], in which the benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazones have also been found to coordinate the metal as a bidentate N,S-donor forming a fourmembered chelate ring as before. Reaction of the Hbztsc-R ligands has also been carried out with [M(bpy)$_2$X$_2$] (M = Ru, Os; X = Cl, Br), which has afforded complexes of type [M(bpy)$_2$(bztsc-R)]$^+$, which have been isolated as perchlorate salts. Coordination mode of bztsc-R has been found to be the same as before. Structure of the Hbztsc-OMe ligand has been determined and some molecular modelling studies have been carried out determine the reason for the observed mode of coordination. Reaction of acetone thiosemicarbazone (Hactsc) has then been carried out with [M(bpy)$_2$X$_2$] to afford the [M(bpy)$_2$(actsc)]ClO$_4$ complexes, in which the actsc ligand coordinates the metal as a bidentate N,S-donor forming a five-membered chelate ring. Reaction of H$_2$saltsc has been carried out with [Ru(bpy)$_2$Cl$_2$] to prepare the [Ru(bpy)$_2$(Hsaltsc)]ClO$_4$ complex, which has then been reacted with one equivalent of nickel perchlorate to afford an octanuclear complex of type [$\{$Ru(bpy)$_2$(saltsc-H)$\}_4$Ni$_4$](ClO$_4$)$_4$.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>This article presents a brief overview of the reactions of 2,4,6-\textit{tris}(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tptz) in presence of rhodium(III), ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) under various experimental conditions. Under certain experimental conditions tptz exhibits metal-assisted hydrolysis/hydroxylation at the triazine ring. However, synthetic methods have also been developed to prepare complexes with intact tptz. Molecular structures of some of the complexes, especially stereoisomers of the hydroxylated products, are established by single crystal X-ray studies. A critical analysis of all data suggests that the electron-withdrawing effect of the metal ion (L$\rightarrow$M $\sigma$donation) is the predominant factor, rather than angular strain, that is responsible for metal-promoted reactivities. Electrochemical properties of all of these complexes have been investigated, Rh(III) complexes are excellent catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO$_2$, and dinuclear Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes exhibit strong electronic communication between the metal centres.</p>

				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0291-0309</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phenomenon of ‘non-innocence’, first articulated by Jørgensen in 1966, is briefly reviewed. Spectroelectrochemical studies of a range of dinuclear complexes of the type [$\{Mo(NO)Tp$^\ast$Cl$\}_2$(bridge)] (bridge = dipyridyls) and [$\{Mo(O)Tp$^\ast$Cl$\}_2$(bridge)] (bridge = diphenolates) which are redox active, show that oxidised or reduced forms of these species exhibit `non-innocence’. The spectral behaviour is associated with metal-to-ligand or ligand-to-metal charge transfer phenomena, probably the first time that monodentate bridging ligands have been implicated in `non-innocent’ behaviour. These bridging ligands also determine the nature and extent of magnetic interaction between the unpaired spins in [$\{Mo(NO)Tp$^\ast$Cl$\}_2$(bridge)] and [$\{$Mo(O)Tp$^\ast$Cl\}_2$(bridge)], the dominant mechanism of spin-exchange relying on the extent of $&eth;$-delocalisation within the bridging ligands. The unusual optical behaviour of these dinuclear complexes when oxidised (oxomolybdenum diphenolates) or reduced (nitrosyl molybdenum dipyridyls) has led to the exploration of electrochromism as a means to develop variable optical attenuators operating in the near-infrared region.</p>

				<title>Inverted porphyrins and expanded porphyrins: An overview</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0311-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Porphyrins and metallopophyrins have attracted the attention of chemists for the past 100 years or more owing to their widespread involvement in biology. More recently, synthetic porphyrins and porphyrin-like macrocycles have attracted the attention of researchers due to their diverse applications as sensitizers for photodynamic therapy, MRI contrasting agents, and complexing agents for larger metal ions and also for their anion binding abilities. The number of $\pi$-electrons in the porphyrin ring can be increased either by increasing the number of conjugated double bonds between the pyrrole rings or by increasing the number of heterocyclic rings. Thus, 22$\pi$ sapphyrins, 26$\pi$ rubyrins, 30$\pi$ heptaphyrins, 34$\pi$ octaphyrins and higher cyclic polypyrrole analogues containing 40$\pi$, 48$\pi$, 64$\pi$, 80$\pi$ and 96$\pi$ systems have recently been reported in the literature. These macrocycles show rich structural diversity where normal and different kinds of inverted structures have been identified. In this review, an attempt has been made to collect the literature of the inverted porphyrins and expanded porphyrins reported until December 2001. Since the \textit{meso} aryl expanded porphyrins have tendency to form both inverted and non-inverted structures more emphasis has been given to \textit{meso} aryl expanded porphyrins.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This presentation reports some novel examples of organic ring amination reactions via metal mediation. The organic transformations are highly regioselective and can be controlled by the proper selection of the mediator complex. The two isomeric organic ligands viz. HL$^1$ and HL$^2$ were isolated in their pure states by the removal of the metal ions. These were fully characterized. The ligand HL$^1$ has low $pKa$, $8\cdot 5$. Upon deprotonation, it behaves as a potential \textit{bis} chelating N,N,N-donors. The coordination chemistry of the HL$^1$ ligand involving some $3d$-metal ions is described. Two unusual low-spin complexes of manganese(II) and iron(III) are reported. The ferric complex displayed a rhombic EPR while, the corresponding manganese compound showed a complex pattern due to hyperfine coupling. All the complexes displayed large number of redox responses. A brief mention about the future projection of this work is noted.</p>

				<title>Is copper(I) really soft? Probing the hardness of Cu(I) with pyridinecarboxaldehyde ligands</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0347-0356</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cu(I) complexes of formula Cu(PPh$_3$)$_2$LClO$_4$ [L = 2 or 3 pyridine carboxaldehyde] are synthesised and characterised to explore the coordination of an aldehyde, a hard and neutral oxygen donor to a soft Cu(I) centre. The structural and spectroscopic results illustrate that only in 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, the `C=O' group coordinates to soft Cu(I) centres due to a favourable chelate effect, while in 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, it remains uncoordinated. Upon chelation via N and O donors, 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde resembles bipyridine or phenanthroline in terms of its bite angle and spectroscopic features. Such chelation can be easily challenged with coordinating anions like bromide, or more basic pyridines. A drastic change in the MLCT absorption signals the decomplexation of the `C=O’ group. The observed results point out that the Cu(I) centre can readily exchange the hard `O’ donor for softer ligands.</p>

				<title>Organotellurium ligands – designing and complexation reactions</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0357-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A variety of tellurium ligands has been designed and studied for their complexation reactions in the last decade. Of these hybrid telluroethers, halotellurium ligands and polytellurides are the most notable ones. RTe$^–$ and polytelluride ions have also been used to design clusters. Ligation of ditelluroethers and several hybrid telluroethers is extensively studied in our laboratories. The ditelluroether ligand RTeCH$_2$TeR (where R = 4-MeOC$_6$H$_4$) ({\bf 1}), similar to dppm [1,2-\textit{bis}(diphenylphosphino) methane], has been synthesized in good yield ($\sim80&#37;$) by reacting CHCl$_3$ with RTe$^–$ (generated in situ by borohydride reduction of R$_2$Te$_2$). Iodine reacts with {\bf 1} to give tetra-iodo derivative, which has intermolecular Te$\cdots$I interactions resulting in a macro structure containing rectangular Te-I$\cdots$Te bridges. {\bf 1} readily forms four membered rings with Pd(II) and Ru(II). On the formation of this chelate ring, the signal in ${}^{125}$Te NMR spectra shifts significantly upfield (50–60 ppm). The bridging mode of {\bf 1} has been shown in [Ru($p$-cymene)Cl$_2$]($\mu-\textbf{1}$)[Ru($p$-cymene)Cl$_2$]. The hybrid telluroether ligands explored are of the types (Te$_x$, S$_y$), (Te$_x$, N$_y$) and (Te$_x$, O$_y$). The tellurium donor site has strong \textit{trans} influence, which is manifested more strongly in square planar complexes of palladium(II). The morpholine N-donor site has been found to have weaker donor characteristics in (Te$_x$, N$_y$) ligands than pyridine and alkylamine donor sites of analogous ligands. The singlet oxygen readily oxidises the coordinated Te. This oxidation follows first order kinetics. The complexation reaction of RuCl$_3$.$x$H$_2$O with N-[2-(4-methoxyphenyltelluro)ethyl]phthalimide ({\bf 2}) results in a novel (Te, N, O)-heterocycle, Te-chloro,Te-anisyl-1a-aza-4-oxa-3-tellura-1H, 2H, 4aH-9 fluorenone. The (Te, O) ligands can be used as hemilabile ligands, the oxygen atom temporarily protects the vacant coordination site before the arrival of the substrate. The chelate shifts observed in ${}^{125}$Te NMR spectra of metal complexes of Te-ligands have a close parallel to those of ${}^{31}$P NMR. For the formation of fivemembered rings, the value is positive and of the order of 130 ppm whereas for sixmembered rings it is negative and $\sim$30 ppm only.</p>

				<title>Novel vanadium phosphate phases as catalysts for selective oxidation</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0379-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In our effort to induce novel modifications in the structure of some important vanadium phosphate phases used as selective oxidation catalysts, it has been observed that metal ions such as Zn$^{2+}$, Ni$^{2+}$, Pd$^{2+}$ can be incorporated into the vanadyl hydrogen phosphate VOHPO$_4\cdot$0$\cdot$5H$_2$O phase in very different ways depending upon the medium of preparation. It has been found that the metal ions are either substituted into the lattice with retention of structure of the parent compound or intercalated between the layers of a new mixed-valent phase. These new metalincorporated phases are catalytically active and the palladium incorporated compound in particular displays shape selective catalysis for different oxidation and reduction reactions. In another approach, the preparation of VOHPO$_4\cdot$0$\cdot$5H$_2$O has been modified to give a novel crystalline phase containing mixed-valent vanadium and having NH$_3$ species bound to the lattice. This phase could be a potential catalyst for ammoxidation reactions. In addition, novel mesostructured vanadium phosphate phases have been prepared using a long-chain amine as the templating agent involving a ligand templating mechanism of formation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Redox active mononuclear and binuclear copper(II) complexes have been prepared and structurally characterized. The complexes have planar N-donor heterocyclic bases like 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), dipyridoquinoxaline (dpq) and dipyridophenazine (dppz) ligands that are suitable for intercalation to B-DNA. Complexes studied for nuclease activity have the formulations [Cu(dpq)$_2$(H$_2$O)] (ClO$_4$)$_2$.H$_2$O ({\bf 1}), [$\{$CuL(H$_2$O)$\}_2$($\mu$-ox)](ClO$_4$)$_2$ (L = bpy, {\bf 2}; phen, {\bf 3}; dpq, {\bf 4}; and dppz, {\bf 5}) and [Cu(L)(salgly)] (L = bpy, {\bf 6}; phen, {\bf 7}; dpq, {\bf 8}; and dppz, {\bf 9}), where salgly is a tridentate Schiff base obtained from the condensation of glycine and salicylaldehyde. The dpq complexes are efficient DNA binding and cleavage active species. The dppz complexes show good binding ability but poor nuclease activity. The cleavage activity of the \textit{bis}-dpq complex is significantly higher than the \textit{bis}-phen complex of copper(II). The nuclease activity is found to be dependent on the intercalating nature of the complex and on the redox potential of the copper(II)/copper(I) couple. The ancillary ligand plays a significant role in binding and cleavage activity.</p>

				<title>New mixed ligand complexes of ruthenium(II) that incorporate a modified phenanthroline ligand: Synthesis, spectral characterization and DNA binding</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0403-0415</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The hexafluorophosphate and chloride salts of two ruthenium(II) complexes, viz. [Ru(phen)(ptzo)$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Ru(ptzo)$_3$]$^{2+}$, where ptzo = 1,10-phenanthrolino[5,6-$e$]1,2,4-triazine-3-one (ptzo) – a new modified phenanthroline (phen) ligand, have been synthesised. These complexes have been characterised by infrared, UV-Vis, steady-state emission and ${}^1$H NMR spectroscopic methods. Results of absorption and fluorescence titration as well as thermal denaturation studies reveal that both the \textit{bis}- and \textit{tris}-complexes of ptzo show moderately strong affinity for binding with calf thymus (CT) DNA with the binding constants being close to 10$^5$M$^{–1}$ in each case. An intercalative mode of DNA binding has been suggested for both the complexes. Emission studies carried out in non-aqueous solvents and in aqueous media without DNA reveal that both [Ru(phen)(ptzo)$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Ru(ptzo)$_3$]$^{2+}$ are weakly luminescent under these solution conditions. Successive addition of CT DNA to buffered aqueous solutions containing [Ru(phen)(ptzo)$_2$]$^{2+}$ results in an enhancement of the emission. These results have been discussed in the light of the dependence of the structure-specific deactivation processes of the MLCT state of the metallointercalator with the characteristic features of its DNA interaction. In doing so, attempts have been made to compare and contrast its properties with those of the analogous phenanthroline-based complexes including the ones reported by us previously.</p>

					<p>The coordination chemistry of copper(II) with tridentate aroylhydrazones is briefly discussed in this article. Two types of aroylhydrazones derived from aroylhydrazines and ortho-hydroxy aldehydes or 2-pyridine-carboxaldehyde have been used. The characterization of the complexes has been performed with the help of various physico-chemical techniques. Solid state structural patterns have been established by X-ray crystallography. In the solid state, structural varieties of these complexes are seen to range from monomeric, dimeric, polymeric and onedimensional self-assembly via hydrogen bonds and $\pi-\pi$ interactions. EPR spectroscopy and variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements have been used to reveal the nature of the coordination geometry and magnetic characteristics of these complexes.</p>

				<title>Bridging function mediated intermetallic coupling in diruthenium-\textit{bis}(bipyridine) complexes</title>
				<feature>Modern Trends in Inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0443-0449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interactions of potentially dinucleating bridging functionalities ({\bf I}–{\bf VI}) with the ruthenium-bis(bypyridine) precursor [Ru$^{II}$(bpy)$_2$(EtOH)$_2$]$^{2+}$ have been explored. The bridging functions {\bf I}, {\bf II} and {\bf VI} directly result in the expected dinuclear complexes of the type [(bpy)$_2$Ru$^{II}\{$L$^n\}$Ru$^{II}$(bpy)$_2$]$^{z+}$ ({\bf 1}, {\bf 2}, {\bf 7} and {\bf 8}) ($n = 0$, $z =4$ and $n = –2$, $z = 2$). The bridging ligand {\bf III} undergoes N–N or N–C bond cleavage reaction on coordination to the Ru$^{II}$(bpy)$_2$ core which eventually yields a mononuclear complex of the type [(bpy)$_2$Ru$^{II}$(L)]$^+$, {\bf 3}, where L = ${}^–$OC$_6$H$_3$(R)C(R')=N–H. However, the electrogenerated mononuclear ruthenium(III) congener, {\bf 3}$^+$ in acetonitrile dimerises to [(bpy)$_2$Ru$^{III}$ $\{^–$OC$_6$H$_3$(R)C(R')=N–N=(R')C(R)C$_6$H$_3$O$^-\}$Ru$^{III}$(bpy)$_2$]$^{4+}$ ({\bf 4}). In the presence of a slight amount of water content in the acetonitrile solvent the dimeric species ({\bf 4}) reduces back to the starting ruthenium(II) monomer ({\bf 3}). The preformed bridging ligand \textbf{IV} undergoes multiple transformations on coordination to the Ru(bpy)$_2$ core, such as hydrolysis of the imine groups of \textbf{IV} followed by intermolecular head-to-tail oxidative coupling of the resultant amino phenol moieties, which in turn results in a new class of dimeric complex of the type [(bpy)$_2$Ru$^{II}$ $\{^–$OC$_6$H$_4$-N=C$_6$H$_3$(=NH)O$^–\}$Ru$^{II}$(bpy)$_2$]$^{2+}$ ({\bf 5}). In {\bf 5}, the bridging ligand comprises of two $N,O$ chelating binding sites each formally in the semiquinone level and there is a $p$-benzoquinonediimine bridge between the metal centres. In complex {\bf 6}, the preformed bridging ligand, 3,6-\textit{bis}(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4,5- tetrazine, H$_2$L (\textbf{V}) undergoes oxidative dehydrogenation to aromatic tetrazine based bridging unit, 3,6-\textit{bis}(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, L. The detailed spectroelectrochemical aspects of the complexes have been studied in order to understand the role of the bridging units towards the intermetallic electronic coupling in the dinuclear complexes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Titanium (IV) phosphates TCM-7 and -8 with mesoporous cationic framework topologies using both cationic and anionic surfactants have been synthesized. Experimental data suggest the stabilization of the tetrahedral state of Ti in TCM-7/8 (O–P–O–Ti–O–, at Ti/P = 1:1) \textit{vis-à-vis} the most stable octahedral state of Ti in the rutile/anatase or pure mesoporous TiO$_2$. Mesoporous TCM-7 and -8 show anion exchange capacity due to the framework phosphonium cation and cation exchange capacity due to defective P–OH groups. Grafting the organic functionality in the surface or bridging the organic moiety in between the inorganic phosphorus precursors can enhance hydrophobicity of these materials similar to that of mesoporous silica materials. The high catalytic activity in the liquid phase partial oxidation of cyclohexene over such organically surface modified mesoporous titanium phosphate using a dilute H$_2$O$_2$ oxidant supports the tetrahedral coordination of Ti in these materials. These materials also show excellent photocatalytic activity in the production of H$_2$ by photo-reduction of water under UV light irradiation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>2D NMR spectroscopy has been used to determine the metal configuration in solution of three complexes, viz. [($\eta^6$-$p$-cymene)Ru(L$^\ast$)Cl] ({\bf 1}) and [($\eta^6$-$p$-cymene)Ru(L$^\ast$)(L')] (ClO$_4$) (L' = H$_2$O, {\bf 2}; PPh$_3$, {\bf 3}), where L$^\ast$ is the anion of ($S$)-(1-phenylethyl)salicylaldimine. The complexes exist in two diastereomeric forms in solution. Both the (R$_{\text{Ru}}$,$S_{\text{C}}$)- and ($S_{\text{Ru}}$,$S_{\text{C}}$)-diastereomers display the presence of attractive CH/$\pi$ interaction involving the phenyl group attached to the chiral carbon and the cymene ring hydrogens. This interaction restricts the rotation of the C$^\ast$–N single bond and, as a result, two structural types with either the hydrogen atom attached to the chiral carbon (C$^\ast$) or the methyl group attached to C$^\ast$ in close proximity of the cymene ring protons get stabilized. Using 2D NMR spectroscopy as a tool, the spatial interaction involving these protons are studied in order to obtain the metal configuration(s) of the diastereomeric complexes in solution. This technique has enabled us to determine the metal configuration as ($R_{\text{Ru}}$,$S_{\text{C}}$) for the major isomers of {\bf 1–3} in solution.</p>

The experimental values of $\rho$ and $\eta$ were used to calculate the values of the apparent molar volume, ($\phi_v$), partial molar volume, ($\phi^\circ_v$) at infinite dilution, $A-$ and $B$-coefficients of the Jones–Dole equation and free energies of activation of viscous flow, ($\Delta \mu^{0^\ast}_1$) and ($\Delta \mu^{0^\ast}_2$), per mole of solvent and solute respectively. The behaviour of these parameters suggests strong ion–solvent interactions in these systems and also that MgSO$_4$ acts as structure-maker in FA $+$ ethylene glycol mixed solvents.</p>

				<title>Isomerization and fluorescence depolarization of merocyanine 540 in polyacrylic acid. Effect of $p$H</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0501-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dynamics of isomerization and fluorescence depolarization of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in an aqueous solution of polyacrylic acid (PAA) have been studied using picosecond time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. It is observed that the dynamics of isomerization and depolarization are sensitive enough to monitor the uncoiling of PAA at high $p$H ($&gt;$ 6). At low $p$H ($&lt;$ 3), when the polymer remains in a hypercoiled form, polymer bound MC540 experiences very high microscopic friction and, hence, the isomerization and depolarization processes are very slow. At high $p$H ($&gt;$ 6) a polyanion is formed and the polymer assumes an extended configuration due to electrostatic repulsion. At high $p$H ($&gt;$ 6), the anionic probe MC540 is expelled from the polyanion to bulk water and the dynamics of isomerization and fluorescence depolarization become faster by 12 and 5 times respectively, compared to those at low $p$H.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of a stable gold hydrosol by the reduction of chloroaurate ions by the amino acid, aspartic acid</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0513-0520</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Development of reliable protocols for the synthesis of nanoparticles of well-defined sizes and good monodispersity is an important aspect of nanotechnology. In this paper, we present details of the synthesis of gold nanoparticles of good monodispersity by the reduction of aqueous chloroaurate ions by the amino acid, aspartic acid. The colloidal gold solution thus formed is extremely stable in time, indicating electrostatic stabilization via nanoparticle surface-bound amino acid molecules. This observation has been used to modulate the size of the gold nanoparticles in solution by varying the molar ratio of chloroaurate ions to aspartic acid in the reaction medium. Characterization of the aspartic acid-reduced gold nanoparticles was carried out by UV-visible spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and transmission electron microscopy. The use of amino acids in the synthesis and stabilization of gold nanoparticle in water has important implications in the development of new protocols for generation of bioconjugate materials.</p>

					<p>Photoinduced electron transfer from chlorophyll-$a$ through the interface of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) headgroup of the lipid bilayers was studied with electron magnetic resonance (EMR). The photoproduced radicals were identified with electron spin resonance (ESR) and radical yields of chlorophyll-$a$ were determined by double integration ESR spectra. The formation of vesicles was identified by changes in measured $\lambda_{\max}$ values from diethyl ether solutions to vesicles solutions indirectly, and observed directly with SEM and TEM images.

					<p>Transition metal ions are notorious for their fluorescence quenching abilities. In this paper, we discuss the design strategies for the development of efficient \textit{off-on} fluorescence signalling systems for the transition metal ions. It is shown that even simple \textit{fluorophore-spacer-receptor} systems can display excellent \textit{off-on} fluorescence signalling towards the quenching metal ions when the fluorophore component is chosen judiciously.</p>

				<title>Photophysical properties of 5-hydroxyindole (5HI): Laser flash photolysis study</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0547-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Steady state fluorescence emission and transient absorption spectra of 9-fluorenone (9FL) were measured in the presence of 5-hydroxyindole (5HI) in highly polar acetonitrile (ACN) environment at ambient temperature. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrate that ground state 5HI as a donor could take part in highly exothermic electron transfer (ET) reactions with excited 9FL, which should serve as electron acceptor. From the transient absorption measurements it is inferred that in geminate ion-pair (GIP) (or contact ion pair), formed initially due to photoinduced ET, the decay of this contact ion-pair occurs not only through ion recombination (back electron transfer to ground state of reactants), but through the other processes also such as proton-transfer (hydrogen abstraction) from radical cation to anion and separation of ion-pair producing the free ions. From the computed reorganisation energy parameter ($\lambda$) and experimentally observed $- \Delta G^0_{ET}$ values it is hinted that there is a possibility that highly exothermic forward electron transfer reactions in the singlet state $S_1$ occur, within present reacting systems, in Marcus inverted region. Back transfer seems to follow the same path. Investigations with similar other reacting systems are underway.</p>

				<title>A new family of donor–acceptor systems comprising tin(IV) porphyrin and anthracene subunits: Synthesis, spectroscopy and energy transfer studies</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0565-0578</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new family of covalently linked `Sn(IV) porphyrin-anthracene’ diad ({\bf 1}), triad ({\bf 2}) and tetrad ({\bf 3}) donor–acceptor (D–A) systems have been designed and synthesized in good-to-moderate yields. While diad {\bf 1} possesses one anthracene subunit at the peripheral (meso) position of the tin(IV) porphyrin scaffold, triad {\bf 2} possesses two trans axial anthracene subunits at the tin(IV) centre. On the other hand, tetrad {\bf 3} is endowed with both the peripheral and axial anthracene subunits in its architecture. These D–A systems have been fully characterised by elemental analysis, FAB-MS, UV-Vis, ${}^1$H and ${}^{13}$C NMR and electrochemical methods. UV-Vis, NMR and redox data suggest the absence of intramolecular $\pi-\pi$ interaction between the porphyrin and the anthracene/s in {\bf 1–3}. Fluorescence from the anthracene subunit in {\bf 1} and {\bf 3} is found to be quenched in comparison with the fluorescence of free anthracene in four different solvents. This is not the case with compound {\bf 2}. Excitation spectral data provides evidence for an intramolecular excitation energy transfer (EET) from the singlet anthracene to the porphyrin in {\bf 1} and {\bf 3}. The energy transfer efficiency is in the order: {\bf 2} (almost negligible) $&lt;$ 3 ($\sim 30&#37;$) $&lt;$ {\bf 1} (nearly quantitative), with the peripheral anthracene $\rightarrow$ porphyrin pathway being largely favoured. This orientation dependence of EET could be analysed using Forster’s dipole dipole mechanism.</p>

				<title>Protein scissors: Photocleavage of proteins at specific locations</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0579-0592</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Site-specific photocleavage of hen egg lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA) by N-(L-phenylalanine)-4(1-pyrene)butyramide (Py-Phe) is investigated in detail with respect to its efficiency, dependence on oxygen, and radical quenchers. Binding of Py-Phe to BSA follows a biphasic process with two binding sites per protein. The photocleavage was achieved upon irradiating a mixture of protein, Py-Phe and Co(III)hexammine (CoHA) at 344 nm. No protein cleavage was observed in the absence of Py-Phe, or CoHA, or light. Photocleavage of BSA was inhibited by degassing or by the addition of radical quenchers such as ethanol. In addition, the photoreaction was quenched by electron donors such as ethanolamine. This result was corroborated by the flash photolysis studies where the cation radical derived from the probe is also quenched by ethanolamine with an equivalent rate constant. Quenching of the singlet excited state of Py-Phe by CoHA followed by the reaction of the resulting pyrenyl cation radical with the protein backbone is the suggested mechanism of protein cleavage. The origin of the specificity of photocleavage is discussed and specificity is valuable in targeting desired sites of proteins with small molecules.</p>

				<title>Photoinduced electron transfer in some photosensitive molecules-incorporated semiconductor/zeolites: New photocatalytic systems</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0593-0602</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) molecule, $p$-N,N-dimethylaminobenzoic acid (DMABA) has been studied in zeolite and colloidal media. The ratio of ICT to normal emission (ICT/LE) is greatly enhanced in zeolites compared to that in polar solvents. The ICT emission of DMABA was quenched by increasing the concentration of TiO$_2$ colloids, while the normal emission was slightly enhanced. Upon illumination of the heteropoly acid (HPA) incorporated TiO$_2$ colloids, interfacial electron transfer takes place from the conduction band of TiO$_2$ to the incorporated HPA which is also excited to catalyze the photoreduction of Methyl Orange. It is found that the interfacial electron transfer mechanism of HPA/TiO$_2$ is quite analogous to the Z-scheme mechanism for plant photosynthetic systems. In DMABA-adsorbed TiO$_2$/Y-zeolite the ICT/LE ratio of DMABA is quite small implying that electron transfer takes place from DMABA to the conduction band of TiO$_2$. This results in drastic enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of DMABA-adsorbed TiO$_2$/Y-zeolite compared to free TiO$_2$/Y-zeolite.</p>

We find that the energy gap between the ground and excited states of the unexcited subunit of allophycocyanin monomer decreases via an interaction with another excited subunit. For allophycocyanin trimer, we find that the fast dynamics results from the fast internal conversion and the first excited state is the only one electronic state which can trap the final population.</p>

				<title>Origin of methyl torsional potential barrier – An overview</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0623-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the evolution of views on methyl internal rotation potential barrier. Various mechanisms proposed for the origin of torsional barrier in ethane have been reviewed. Inadequacy of one dimensional description of internal rotation has been highlighted in small methyl conjugated molecules in the light of its multidimensional nature. The effect of skeletal flexing on the picture of barrier formation by dissecting the barrier energy into potential type, virial type and symmetry type is described. The role of $\rho$ and $\sigma$ electrons at different stages of molecular flexing is discussed. The analysis identifies the dominant contributions to barrier origin as $\pi$-bonding changes during rigid rotation and $\sigma$-bonding changes resulting from bond lengthening during methyl group rotation. The contribution of lone pair electrons in determining the preferred structure of the methyl group in imine compounds such as 1-methyl 2-(1H)-pyridinimine is presented.</p>

				<page>0639-0648</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser isotope separation (LIS) by infrared laser chemistry of polyatomic molecules has come a long way since its discovery. The last decade has seen considerable efforts in scaling up of the process for light elements like carbon, oxygen and silicon. These efforts aim at ways to improve both the enrichment factor and the throughput. The achievement is quite significant especially for carbon isotope separation wherein macroscopic operating scales have been realized. We report our studies on the IR laser chemistry of two promising systems, viz. neat CF$_2$HCl and CF$_3$Br/Cl$_2$. We have investigated conditions for optimizing the dissociation yield and selectivity using natural samples containing $1 \cdot 1 &#37;$ C-13. We also highlight our current efforts for scaling up the process. These include the design aspects of a photochemical reactor with multipass refocusing Herriott optics for efficient photon utilization, development of a cryogenic distillation set up and a preparative gas chromatograph for large scale separation/collection of the isotopically enriched photoproduct in the post-irradiation stage.</p>

				<title>Modelling of multifrequency IRMPD for laser isotope separation</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0649-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The process of infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) of molecules is of great fundamental importance and has practical significance, such as isotope separation etc. Unfortunately, a clear insight into the process has been hindered by the bewildering array of important variables affecting MPD. The dissociation probability $\gamma$ ($\phi$) i.e. the yield has been found to be a sensitive function of laser fluence $\phi$ along with numerous other parameters like laser frequency, gas pressure etc. We have shown that in single frequency IRMPD, an accurate quantitative characterization of the dissociation probability can be adequately expressed by a `power law’ model with two fitting parameters namely critical fluence, $\phi_c$ and multiphoton order, $m$. This model was exploited in analysing our MPD results on various systems. However, the small isotope shift encountered in heavy elements and the sticking phenomenon observed in small light molecules restrict respectively the separation factor and the dissociation yield. These problems can effectively be tackled by irradiation with multifrequency laser beams which can be chosen appropriately on the basis of spectroscopic features. Based on our success in single frequency model, multifrequency IRMPD is modelled by a functional form containing the product of power law terms for individual fluences on irradiation frequencies. This model is successfully benchmarked with our experimental results on multifrequency LIS of tritium. Such knowledge can be utilized for appropriate separation process design, evaluation and optimization.</p>

				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0659-0673</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Selective multi-photon dissociation (MPD) of Freon-22 (CF$_2$HCl) molecules has been carried out using a TEA CO$_2$ laser at various CO$_2$ laser lines (9$P$(20)-9$P$(26)) in order to maximize the yield of C-13 isotope in the product (C$_2$F$_4$) at an enrichment factor of 100. The effects of laser pulse tail due to the presence of N$_2$ in the laser mixture on the enrichment factor and yield of C-13 are investigated. It is found that the addition of a small amount of N$_2$ is possible in the laser mixture without a significant drop in the yield at desired enrichment factor. Addition of a small amount of N$_2$ improves the laser efficiency considerably. At a given pulse energy, a slight change in the near field intensity distribution of a laser severely affects the selectivity of C-13 isotope. The computed far-field intensity distributions of the measured near-field intensities show marked spatial variation in the focal spots that leads to a drop in selectivity. For macroscopic production of C-13 isotope a simple and novel multi-pass cavity has been designed and tested to focus the energy repeatedly keeping the optimum fluence constant at each focal spot.</p>

					<p>The dynamics of formation of oxygen atoms after UV photoexcitation of SO$_2$ in the gas-phase was studied by pulsed laser photolysis-laser-induced fluorescence `pump-and-probe’ technique in a flow reactor. SO$_2$ at room-temperature was excited at the KrCl excimer laser wavelength (222$\cdot$4 nm) and O(${}^3$P$_j$) photofragments were detected under collision-free conditions by vacuum ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence. The use of narrow-band probe laser radiation, generated via resonant third-order sum-difference frequency conversion of dye laser radiation in Krypton, allowed the measurement of the nascent O(${}^3$P$_{j=2,1,0}$) fine-structure state distribution: $n_{j=2}/n$_{j=1}/n_{j=0}$ = $(0\cdot 88 \pm 0\cdot$ 02)/(0 \cdot 10 \pm 0 \cdot 01)/(0 $\cdot 02 \pm 0 \cdot 01)$. Employing NO$_2$ photolysis as a reference, a value of $\Phi_{\text{O({}$^3$P)}} = 0 \cdot 13 \pm  0 \cdto 05$ for the absolute O(${}^3$P) atom quantum yield was determined. The measured O(${}^3$P) quantum yield is compared with the results of earlier fluorescence quantum yield measurements. A suitable mechanism is suggested in which the dissociation proceeds via internal conversion from high rotational states of the initially excited SO$_2$($\tilde{C^1} B$_2$) (1, 2, 2) vibronic level to nearby continuum states of the electronic ground state.</p>

				<title>Interaction between an 8-methoxypyrimido[$4',5'$:$4,5$] thieno (2,3-$b$)quinoline-4(3H)one antitumour drug and deoxyribonucleic acid</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of 8-methoxypyrimido[$4',5'$:$4,5$] thieno ($2,3-b$)quinoline-4(3H)one (MPTQ) with DNA was studied by UV-Vis and fluorescenc'e spectrophotometry as well as by hydrodynamic methods. On binding to DNA, the absorption spectrum underwent bathochromic and hypochromic shifts and the fluorescence was quenched. Binding parameters, determined from spectrophotometric measurements by Scatchard analysis, indicated a binding constant of $3.56 \times 10^6$ M$^{–1}$ for calf thymus DNA at ionic strength 0$\cdot$01 M. Binding to the GC-rich DNA of \textit{Micrococcus lysodeikticus} was stronger than the binding to calf thymus DNA at ionic strength 0$\cdot$01 M. The MPTQ increased the viscosity of sonicated rod-like DNA fragments, producing a calculated length of 2$\cdot$4 Å/bound MPTQ molecule. The binding of MPTQ to DNA increased the melting temperature by about 4$^\circ$C. This research offers a new intercalation functional group to DNA targetted drug design.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Deaerated 5 M NaCl solution is irradiated in the presence of UO$_2$ pellets with a-radiation from ${}^{238}$Pu. Experiments are conducted with ${}^{238}$Pu doped pellets and others with ${}^{238}$Pu dissolved in the brine. The radiolysis products and yields of mobilized U and Pu from the oxidative dissolution of UO$_2$ are determined. Results found for radiolysis products and for the oxidation/dissolution of pellets immersed in Pu containing brine are similar to results for Pu doped pellets, where the radiation chemical processes occur only in the liquid layer of some 10 $\mu$m thickness adjacent to the pellet. The yield of radiolysis products is comparable to earlier results, that of mobilized U from the pellets is $&lt;$ 1$&#37;$ of the total amount of oxidized species. Thus, the radiation chemical yield ($G$-value) for mobilized hexavalent U is $&lt;$ 0$\cdot$01 ions/100 eV. In spite of the low radiation yield for the corrosion, the rate of UO$_2$ dissolution is higher than expected for the concentrations of long-lived oxidizing radiolysis compounds found in the solutions.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence studies on radiation oxidative damage to membranes with implications to cellular radiosensitivity</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0705-0711</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radiation oxidative damage to plasma membrane and its consequences to cellular radiosensitivity have received increasing attention in the past few years. This review gives a brief account of radiation oxidative damage in model and cellular membranes with particular emphasis on results from our laboratory. Fluorescence and ESR spin probes have been employed to investigate the structural and functional alterations in membranes after g-irradiation. Changes in the lipid bilayer in irradiated unilamellar liposomes prepared from egg yolk lecithin (EYL) were measured by using diphenylhexatriene (DPH) as a probe. The observed increase in DPH polarization and decrease in fluorescence intensity after g-irradiation of liposomes imply radiationinduced decrease in bilayer fluidity. Inclusion of cholesterol in liposome was found to protect lipids against radiation damage, possibly by modulation of bilayer organization e.g. lipid packing. Measurements on dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes loaded with 6-carboxyfluorescein (CF) showed radiation dose-dependent release of the probe indicating radiation-induced increased permeability. Changes in plasma membrane permeability of thymocytes were monitored by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by 2,7-dichlorodihydro fluorescein diacetate (DCH-FDA). Results suggest a correlation between ROS generation and membrane permeability changes induced by radiation within therapeutic doses (0–10 Gy). It is concluded that increase in membrane permeability was the result of ROS-mediated oxidative reactions, which might trigger processes leading to apoptotic cell death after radiation exposure.</p>

				<title>An immunomodulator from Tinospora cordifolia with antioxidant activity in cell-free systems</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>
				<page>0713-0719</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several plant products are known to exhibit immense medicinal value against human diseases. Our earlier studies showed that dry stem crude extract (DSCE) of \textit{Tinospora cordifolia} contained a polyclonal B cell mitogen, G1-4A. DSCE as well as G1-4A also enhanced immune response in mice. In order to explore the possibility of using G1-4A/PPI (partially purified immunomodulator) to modulate radiation induced immunosuppression, the antioxidant effect of PPI from this plant was examined against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), generated by photosensitization/peroxynitrite. Levels of lipid peroxidation products, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in liver/spleen homogenate from mouse were monitored. Photosensitization induced significant increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in liver. The activities of SOD and catalase were reduced considerably. PPI, present during photosensitisation, prevented lipid peroxidation and restored the activities of both the enzymes. Likewise, oxidative damage induced by peroxynitrite was inhibited by PPI. The degradation of proteins due to photosensitization as assessed by SDS-PAGE was effectively reduced by simultaneous treatment with PPI during photosensitization. Selective inhibitors of ROS like mannitol, SOD, sodium azide and antioxidants, GSH and vitamin C brought about significant inhibition of formation of TBARS suggesting possible involvement of O$_2^{–\bullet}$,${}^{\bullet}$OH and ${}^{1}$O$_2$. Photosensitization in deuterated buffer enhanced formation of TBARS thus indicating generation of ${}^1$O$_2$. Thus, the action of PPI may be against oxidative damage through Type I and II photosensitization mechanisms. Therefore, the immunomodulator from \textit{Tinospora cordifolia} may also be beneficial as an antioxidant.</p>

				<title>Redox chemistry of $o-$ and $m$-hydroxycinnamic acids: A pulse radiolysis study</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Radiation chemical reactions of ${}^{\bullet}$OH, O$^{\bullet -}$, N$_3^{\bullet}$ and $e^-_{aq}$ with $o-$ and $m$-hydroxycinnamic acids were studied. The second-order rate constants for the reaction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH with ortho and meta isomers in buffer solution at $p$H 7 are $3\cdot9\pm0\cdot 2 \times 10^9$ and $4 \cdot 4 \pm  0 \cdot 3 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$ respectively. At $p$H 3 the rate with the ortho isomer was halved ($1 \cdot 6 \pm 0 \cdot 4 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$) but it was unaffected in the case of meta isomer ($k = 4 \cdot 2 \pm 0 \cdot 6 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$). The rate constant in the reaction of N$_3^{\bullet}$ with the ortho isomer is lower by an order of magnitude ($k = 4 \cdot 9 \pm 0 \cdot 4 \times 10^8$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$s$^{–1}$). The rates of the reaction of $e^-_{aq}$ with ortho and meta isomers were found to be diffusion controlled. The transient absorption spectrum measured in the ${}^{\bullet}$OH with $o$-hydroxycinnamic acid exhibited an absorption maximum at 360 nm and in meta isomer the spectrum was blue-shifted (330 nm) with a shoulder at 390 nm. A peak at 420 nm was observed in the reaction of O$^{\bullet-}$ with the $o$-isomer whereas the meta isomer has a maximum at 390 and a broad shoulder at 450 nm. In the reaction of $e^-_{aq}$, the absorption peaks were centred at 370–380 nm in both the isomers. The underlying reaction mechanism is discussed.</p>

					<p>The kinetics of the reactions of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms with some aliphatic alcohols in aqueous solutions were studied using pulse radiolysis. Based on the increase in optical absorption in the UV region, the rate constants for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms with methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or $t$-butyl alcohol were determined to be $9 \cdot 0 \times 10^8$, $2\cdot2 \times 10^9$,  $2\cdot 0 \times 10^9$, $6 \cdot 2 \times 10^8$ and $1 \cdot 1 \times 10^6$, $1 \cdot 8 \times 10^7$, $5 \cdot 3  \times 10^7$, $2 \cdot 3  \times 10^5$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$ respectively. The bimolecular decay rate constants for the alcohol radicals produced in methanol and ethanol were evaluated to be $2  \cdot 4 \times  10^9$ and $1 \cdot 5 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$. The values observed are in fairly good agreement with those reported earlier.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The free radical scavenging properties and possible antioxidant activity of 1,3-diphenylpropane-1,3-dione ({\bf 1}) are reported. Pulse radiolysis technique was employed to study the one-electron oxidation of {\bf 1} with various radicals viz. CCl$_3$O$_2^{\bullet}$, N$_3^{\bullet}$ and ${}^{\bullet}$OH in homogeneous aqueous solution. All these radicals reacted with {\bf 1} under ambient conditions at almost diffusion controlled rates producing transient species with an absorption maximum around 420 nm that decayed at first order rates. The transient absorption peak was shifted in the case of CCl$_3$OO$^{\bullet}$ radical reaction with {\bf 1} due to change in the polarity of the medium. Formation of a stable product with a broad absorption band starting from 400 nm and cut off at 230 nm was observed in the oxidation of {\bf 1} with ${}^{\bullet}$OH and ${}^{\bullet}$N$_3$ radicals. In a biological system also, {\bf 1} showed significant inhibitory activity against Fe$^{2+}$-mediated lipid peroxidation. Based on these observations, a suitable mechanism for the oxidation of {\bf 1} has been proposed.</p>

				<title>Effect of electron-withdrawing power of the substituted group on ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical reaction with substituted aryl sulphides: A pulse radiolysis study</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Photochemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>In neutral aqueous solution of (phenylthio)acetic acid, hydroxyl radical is observed to react with a bimolecular rate constant of $7 \cdot 2 \times 10^9$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$ and the transient absorption bands are assigned to ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical addition to benzene and sulphur with a rough estimated values of 50 and 40$&#37;$ respectively. The reaction of the ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical with diphenyl sulphide ($k = 4 \cdot 3 \times 10^8$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$) is observed to take place with formation of solute radical cation, OH-adduct at sulphur and benzene with estimated values of about 12, 28 and 60$&#37;$ respectively. The transient absorption bands observed on reaction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical, in neutral aqueous solution of 4-(methylthio) phenyl acetic acid, are assigned to solute radical cation ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 550$ and 730 nm), OH-adduct at sulphur ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 360$ nm) and addition at benzene ring ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 320$ nm). The fraction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical reacting to form solute radical cation is observed to depend on the electron-withdrawing power of substituted group. In acidic solutions, depending on the concentration of acid and electron-withdrawing power, solute radical cation is the only transient species formed on reaction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical with the sulphides studied.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>New symmetrical compartmental binucleating ligands 2,6-\textit{bis[N-(2-$&#123;$dimethylamino$&#125;$ethyl)-N-methyl)aminomethyl]-3,4-dimethylphenol [HL$^1$] and 2,6-\textit{bis}[N-(2-$&#123;$diethylamino$&#123;$ethyl)-N-ethyl)aminomethyl]-3,4-dimethylphenol [HL$^2$], and their copper(II) complexes [Cu$_2$L$^{1–2}$(X)]ClO$_4$, (X = NO$_2^–$, OAc$^–$ and OH$^–$) have been prepared. Spectral, catalytic, magnetic, EPR and electrochemical studies have been carried out. A catecholase activity study indicates that only HL$^1$ complexes have efficient catalytic activity due to a less sterically hindered methyl group and enhanced planarity (larger $–2J$ values) with respect to the oxidation of 3,5-di-$t$-butylcatechol to the corresponding quinone. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility studies of the complexes show antiferromagnetic interaction between the copper atoms. X-band EPR signals could not be observed for polycrystalline samples both at room temperatures and liquid nitrogen, consistent with two antiferrromagnetically coupled copper centres in the solid state. EPR spectral studies in methanol solvent show welldefined four hyperfine signals at room temperature due to decomposition of the dimer into monomers. This however is not seen in frozen methanol glass, may be owing to restructuring of the monomers into dimers due to an increase in viscosity of the solvent. Electrochemical studies revealed chemically irreversible behaviour due to chemical or/and stereochemical changes subsequent to electron transfer.</p>

					<p>Tetravalent metal acid (TMA) salts are cation exchangers due to the presence of structural hydroxyl groups. The presence of protons makes the TMA salt, a potential candidate for solid state protonic conduction. In the present endeavour, amorphous inorganic ion exchangers of the class of TMA salts, tin tungstate (SnW), titanium tungstate (TiW) and zirconium tungstate (ZrW) have been synthesized and characterized for elemental analysis, thermal analysis (TGA, DSC), FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray analysis. Chemical resistivity of these materials have been assessed in various acidic, basic and organic media. Ion exchange capacity has been determined and effect of heating on ion exchange capacity has been studied. The proton conduction behaviour of these materials has been studied by measuring specific conductance ($\sigma$) at different temperatures in the range 30–175$^\circ$C using HP 4192 A impedance analyzer. The specific conductance values for the three materials have been compared.</p>

					<p>The ligand N,N'-diformylhydrazine (DFH) is a resonance hybrid of its keto- and enol-forms. The resonance structures indicate enolisation of one as well as both the carbonyl groups. This indicates the presence of dissociable protons in the molecule. Equilibrium studies carried out with DFH indicate the presence of one dissociable proton. The solid complexes of Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Pb(II) with DFH have been synthesized, and have been characterized by elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, IR, Far-IR, ${}^1$H NMR, TGA, FAB and reflectance spectra. IR and ${}^1$H NMR spectra of the complexes indicate deprotonation of both the enol protons upon complexation. Elemental and TG analyses of Mn(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) DFH complexes indicate 1 : 1 metal to ligand composition. The dimeric nature of the Mn(II)–DFH complex is supported by its FAB spectrum.</p>

					<p>A new spectrophotometric method for the assay of trazodone (TZ) has been described. TZ forms a complex in stoichiometric proportions with phosphomolybdic acid. The released phosphomolybdic acid from the complex with acetone is reduced with a new reductant (cobalt nitrate–ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid) to molybdenum blue, which has maximum absorption at 840 nm. Beer's law limits, precision and accuracy of the methods are checked by the UV reference method.

				<abstract>
					<p>Iminodiazonium ions ($\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations) were produced in aqueous solution by chemical initiation (solvolysis) of benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides. Solvolysis reactions of benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides in water proceed by a stepwise mechanism through $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocation intermediates, which are captured by water to give the corresponding carbonyl compounds as the sole detectable products. Rate constant ratio $k_{az}/k_s$ (M$^{–1}$) for partitioning of the carbocation between reaction with azide ion and reaction with water was determined by analysis of azide common ion inhibition of the solvolysis reaction. Rate constants $k_s$ (s$^{–1}$) for the reaction of the cation with solvent water were determined from the experimental values of $k_{az}/k_s$ and $k_{\text{solv}}, for the solvolysis of the benzyl-\textit{gem}-diazides, using $k_{\text{az}} = 5 \times 10^9$ M$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$ for diffusion-limited reactions of azide ion with $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations. Values of $1/k_s$ were thus the lifetimes of the $\alpha$-azidobenzyl carbocations. From the study of effect of temperature on $k_{\text{solv}}$ and $k_s$ the activation parameters are determined and discussed.</p>

				<title>Measures to evaluate heteroaromaticity and their limitations: Story of skeletally substituted benzenes</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0049-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>\textit{Ab initio} HF, MP2, CCSD(T) and hybrid density functional B3LYP calculations were performed on a series of skeletally mono- and di-substituted benzenes, (CH)$_5$Z and (CH)$_4$Z$_2$, Z = C$^–$, N, O$^+$, Si$^–$, P, S$^+$, Ge$^–$, As, Se$^+$, BH$^–$, NH$^+$, AlH$^–$, SiH, PH$^+$, GaH$^–$, GeH and AsH$^+$. Various measures of aromaticity such as the bond length equalization, homodesmic equations, singlet–triplet energy difference (DE$_{s–t}$), chemical hardness ($\eta$) and out-of-plane distortive tendency are critically analysed. The relative energy ordering in skeletally disubstituted benzenes displays trends that are inexplicable based on conventional wisdom. In general, the orthoisomer is found to be the least stable when the substituent is from the second row, whereas if the substituent is from the fourth row, the ortho-isomer is the most stable. Various qualitative arguments, including (a) lone pair–lone pair repulsion, (b) the sum of bond strengths in the twin Kekule forms, and (c) the rule of topological charge stabilization (TCS), are used to explain the observed relative energy trends. The rule of TCS in conjunction with the sum of bond strengths is found to predict the relative energy ordering reasonably well. The reactivity of this class of compounds is assessed based on their singlet–triplet energy differences, chemical hardness and the frequencies corresponding to out-of-plane skeletal distortions. These reactivity indices show less kinetic stability for the compounds with substituents from the fourth row and point to the fact that the thermodynamically most stable compounds need not be the least reactive ones. The $\Delta E_{s–t}$ values indicate that the $\pi$-framework of benzene weakens upon skeletal substitutions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidation of nine aliphatic primary alcohols by quinolinium bromochromate (QBC) in dimethylsulphoxide leads to the formation of the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction is first order with respect to both QBC and the alcohol. The reaction is catalysed by hydrogen ions. The hydrogen-ion dependence has the form: $k_{\text{obs}} = a + b$[H$^+$]. The oxidation of [1,1-$^2$H$_2$]ethanol (MeCD$_2$OH) exhibits a substantial primary kinetic isotope effect. The reaction has been studied in nineteen different organic solvents. The solvent effect was analysed using Taft’s and Swain's multiparametric equations. The rate of oxidation is susceptible to both polar and steric effects of the substituents. A suitable mechanism has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and equilibria of axial ligation of bromomethyl(aquo) cobaloxime by a series of straight chain primary amines (methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, pentylamine, hexylamine), cycloamines (cyclopentylamine, cyclohexylamine, cycloheptylamine) and secondary amines (N,N-dimethylamine, N,N-diethylamine) have been measured as functions of pH by spectrophotometric technique in aqueous solution, ionic strength 1 M (KCl) at 25$^\circ$C. The rate of substitution of H$_2$O varies with the $p$Ka of incoming ligand, thus establishing nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. Binding and kinetic data are interpreted based on the basicity and steric influence of the entering ligand. To compare the rate constants of the entering ligands, pH independent second-order rate constants ($k_{\text{on}}$) are calculated.</p>

The free acids and their hydrazinium salts have been characterized by analytical, IR spectroscopic and thermal studies. IR spectra of all the salts show N–N stretching frequencies of the N$_2$H$_5^+$ ion in the region 975–960 cm$^{–1}$. The thermoanalytical behaviour of the free acids and their salts has been investigated by simultaneous TG and DTA. While pyrazinecarboxylic acid shows single-step endothermic (229$^{\circ}$C) complete decomposition, pyrazindicarboxylic acid shows exothermic decarboxylation followed by identical endothermic decomposition as that of the former. Similarly, salts of the monocarboxylic acid show endothermic effects during pyrolysis, whereas salts of the dicarboxylic acid show endothermic followed by exothermic decomposition. The acids and their salts both undergo complete decomposition to gaseous products.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Phenol is nitrated regioselectively by fuming nitric acid inside the cages of faujasite zeolites (dependent on the loading level) and a remarkable orthoselectivity is observed in solid state nitration. Toluene and chlorobenzene also containing ortho-/para-orienting substituents, undergo faster nitration, though the regioselectivity is less significant in zeolite media. The results are explained on the basis of diffusion and binding of phenol inside zeolite, which facilitate regioselectivity (and which is absent in toluene and chlorobenzene). Other advantages of employing zeolites as media for mild and selective nitration are also highlighted.</p>

				<title>Kinetics and mechanism of protection of thymine from sulphate radical anion under anoxic conditions</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0123-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rates of photooxidation of thymine in presence of peroxydisulphate (PDS) have been determined by measuring the absorbance of thymine at 264 nm spectrophotometrically. The rates and the quantum yields ($\phi$) of oxidation of thymine by sulphate radical anion have been determined in the presence of different concentrations of caffeic acid. Increase in [caffeic acid] is found to decrease the rate of oxidation of thymine suggesting that caffeic acid acts as an efficient scavenger of SO$^{\bullet -}_4$ and protects thymine from it. Sulphate radical anion competes for thymine as well as for caffeic acid. The rate constant of sulphate radical anion with caffeic acid has been calculated to be $1 \cdot 24 \times 10^{10}$ dm$^3$ mol$^{–1}$ s$^{–1}$. The quantum yields of photooxidation of thymine have been calculated from the rates of oxidation of thymine and the light intensity absorbed by PDS at 254 nm, the wavelength at which PDS is activated to sulphate radical anion. From the results of experimentally determined quantum yields ($\phi_{\text{exptl}}$) and the quantum yields calculated ($\phi_{\text{cl}}$) assuming caffeic acid acting only as a scavenger of SO$^{\bullet -}_4$ radicals show that $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values are lower than $\phi_{\text{cl}}$ values. The $\phi'$ values, which are experimentally found quantum yield values at each caffeic acid concentration and corrected for SO$^{\bullet-}_4$ scavenging by caffeic acid, are also found to be greater than $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values. These observations suggest that the thymine radicals are repaired by caffeic acid in addition to scavenging of sulphate radical anions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidation of meta- and para-substituted benzylamines by cetyltrimethylammonium permanganate (CTAP) to the corresponding aldimines is first order with respect to both the amine and CTAP. Oxidation of deuteriated benzylamine (PhCD$_2$NH$_2$) exhibited the presence of a substantial kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 5 \cdot 60$ at 293 K). This confirmed the cleavage of an $\alpha$-C–H bond in the ratedetermining step. Correlation analyses of the rates of oxidation of 19 monosubstituted benzylamines were performed with various single and multiparametric equations. The rates of the oxidation showed excellent correlations in terms of Yukawa–Tsuno and Brown’s equations. The polar reaction constants are negative. The oxidation exhibited an extensive cross-conjugation, in the transition state, between the electron-donating substituents and the reaction centre. A mechanism involving a hydride-ion transfer from the amine to CTAP in the rate-determining step has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of oxidation of five vicinal and four non-vicinal diols, and two of their monoethers, by tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) has been studied. The vicinal diols yield products arising out of glycol-bond fission, while the non-vicinal diols produce the hydroxycarbonyl compounds. The reaction is first-order with respect to TBATB. Michaelis–Menten type kinetics is observed with respect to diols. The reaction fails to induce the polymerization of acrylonitrile. There is no effect of tetrabutylammonium chloride on the reaction rate. The proposed reactive oxidizing species is the tribromide ion. The effect of solvent composition indicates that the rate increases with increase in the polarity of the solvent. The oxidation of [1,1,2,2-$^2$H$_4$] ethanediol shows the absence of any primary kinetic isotope effect. Values of solvent isotope effect, $k$(H$_2$O)/$k$(D$_2$O), at 288 K for the oxidation of ethanediol, propane-1,3-diol and 3-methoxybutan-1-ol are $3 \cdot 41$, $0 \cdot 98$ and $1 \cdot 02$ respectively. A mechanism involving a glycol-bond fission has been proposed for the oxidation of vicinal diols. Non-vicinal diols are oxidised by a hydride-transfer mechanism, as they are monohydric alcohols.</p>

The resins are more selective at pH 10 for Pb(II) and Hg(II), whereas at pH 6 they are found to be Cd(II) and Cr(VI) selective. Metal ion uptake properties of resins follow Freundlich’s equation.

				<abstract>
					<p>Multi-photon dissociation of Freon-22 (CF$_2$HCl) at low temperatures has been carried out to separate the C-13 isotope using a TEA CO$_2$ laser. Yield and enrichment of C-13 isotope in the product C$_2$F$_4$ are studied at 9$P$($22$) laser line as a function of temperature (–50$^\circ$C to 30$^\circ$C). It is observed that at a given fluence when the temperature is lowered the yield decreases and the enrichment factor of C-13 increases.</p>
					<p>Room temperature irradiation of CF$_2$HCl towards the blue edge of C-13 absorption (i.e. at 9$P$(20) laser line) gives low yield of the product (C$_2$F$_4$) at a fluence, which produces the desired enrichment factor of 100. An increase in fluence gives very high yield of C$_2$F$_4$ but the enrichment factor is very low. Irradiating CF$_2$HCl at a temperature of –10$^\circ$C enhances the enrichment factor to 100 and the yield obtained is comparable to that towards the red edge of C-13 absorption (i.e. at 9$P$(26) laser line).</p>
					<p>At a given enrichment factor higher enrichment efficiency is achieved when CF$_2$HCl is irradiated at lower temperature.</p>

				<title>Solvent effects on some new meso-aryl substituted octabromoporphyrins</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0263-0271</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of porphyrins with tolyl and naphthyl substituents at the meso positions, their octabromoderivatives (OBP) with Br substituents at $\beta$-pyrrole positions are synthesised and characterised by chemical analysis, 1H NMR and electronic spectral studies. It is seen that all the OBPs exhibit pronounced red shifts in both the Soret and $Q$ bands of their electronic spectra compared to their nonbrominated form in various polar and nonpolar solvents, the energy difference $\Delta\bar{v}$ being in the range 2300–2700 cm$^{–1}$. The high energy $B$ band of naphthyl porphyrins (both brominated and nonbrominated) are found to be more red-shifted than that of tolyl porphyrins, owing to the noticeable mesomeric effect of the naphthyl groups. Detailed spectral studies reveal that while none of the nonbrominated porphyrin show solvent-dependent change in their $B$ and $Q$ bands, all the OBPs manifest significant shifts depending on the nature of solvents. Solvent–solute interaction can be considered to be of strong dipole–dipole nature for OBPs with polar solvents and of $\pi - \pi$ type with aromatic non-polar solvents. In the brominated form we find two categories of porphyrins exhibiting distinctly different absorption phenomena in aromatic solvents. The OBPs having \textit{meso}-groups not shielding the porphyrin $\pi$-framework exhibit additional absorption peaks (split Soret peaks and broadened Q bands) in some aromatic solvents. This could be explained in terms of $\pi - \pi$ type donor-acceptor (DA) complex formation between such bromoporphyrins (acceptor) and the aromatic solvent molecules (donor) that is not possible for OBPs that have bulky \textit{meso} groups that block the approach of aromatic solvent molecules close to the porphyrin framework.</p>

				<page>0273-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photoamination of 4-nitroveratrole in cyclodextrins with the nucleophiles ammonia, methylamine and hexylamine provides a new route to regioselectivity. This method gives a displaced product para to the nitro group as the predominant product, in contrast to the solution reaction wherein the meta-displaced product predominates. This is due to the change in the mechanistic shift from S$_N$2Ar$^\ast$, wherein the nitro group is meta-directing, to a mechanism involving electron transfer from the nucleophile to the excited aromatic substrate (S$_N$ (ET)Ar$^\ast$) to give the para-displaced product.</p>

					<p>Combustion of dilute propane ($0  \cdot 9 mol&#37;$) over Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ catalysts prepared using different precipitating agents (viz. TMAOH, TEAOH, TPAOH, TBAOH and NH$_4$OH), having different Mn/Zr ratios ($0 \cdot 05 –0 \cdot 67$) and calcined at different temperatures (500–800$^\circ$C), has been thoroughly investigated at different temperatures (300–500$^\circ$C) and space velocities (25,000–100,000 cm$^3$ g$^{–1}$ h$^{–1}$) for controlling propane emissions from LPG-fuelled vehicles. Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ catalyst shows high propane combustion activity, particularly when its ZrO$_2$ is in the cubic form, when its Mn/Zr ratio is close to $0 \cdot 2$ and when it is prepared using TMAOH as a precipitating agent and calcined at 500–600$^\circ$C. Pulse reaction of propane in the absence of free-O$_2$ over Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ (cubic) and Mn-impregnated ZrO$_2$ (monoclinic) catalysts has also been investigated for studying the relative reactivity and mobility of the lattice oxygen of the two catalysts. Both reactivity and mobility of the lattice oxygen of Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ are found to be much higher than that of Mnimpregnated ZrO$_2$. Propane combustion over Mn-doped ZrO$_2$ catalyst involves a redox mechanism.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Effect of added NaCl on the spectral and kinetic properties of cationically charged dye (cresyl violet) and anionically charged surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate) were studied in the pre-micellar and micellar regions. Addition of $0 \cdot 2$M NaCl to dye-surfactant solution decreased the critical micellar concentration for the micellization of the dye in sodium dodecyl sulphate to $1 \cdot 2 \times 10^{–3}$ M. Time-resolved studies using a stopped-flow spectrometer showed that NaCl influences the dynamics of micellisation. Addition of NaCl during the dye–surfactant complex formation converted the complex into micellized form at NaCl concentration of $0 \cdot 01$ to $0 \cdot 05$ M. In contrast, much higher concentration of NaCl (2 M) is required for the salting-out effect of the dye–surfactant complex for conversion to the micellized form.</p>

				<title>Kinetics of proton transfer in a green fluorescent protein: A laser-induced pH jump study</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0307-0317</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sub-millisecond protonation dynamics of the chromophore in S65T mutant form of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was tracked after a rapid pH jump following laser-induced proton release from the caged photolabile compound o-nitrobenzaldehyde. Following a jump in pH from 8 to 5 (which is achieved within 2 $\mu$s), the fluorescence of S65T GFP decreased as a single exponential with a time constant of $\tilde 90 \mu$s. This decay is interpreted as the conversion of the deprotonated fluorescent GFP chromophore to a protonated non-fluorescent species. The protonation kinetics showed dependence on the bulk viscosity of the solvent, and therefore implicates bulk solvent-controlled protein dynamics in the protonation process. The protonation is proposed to be a sequential process involving two steps: (a) proton transfer from solvent to the chromophore, and (b) internal structural rearrangements to stabilize a protonated chromophore. The possible implications of these observations to protein dynamics in general is discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>By using phenylacetylene based rigid-rod linkers (PhA), we have successfully synthesized two fullerene derivatives, C$_{60}$–PhA and C$_{60}$–PhA–C$_{60}$. The absorption spectral features of C$_{60}$, as well as that of the phenylacetylene moiety are retained in the monomeric forms of these fullerene derivatives, ruling out the possibility of any strong interaction between the two chromophores in the ground state. Both the fullerene derivatives form optically transparent clusters, absorbing in the UV-Vis region; this clustering leads to a significant increase in their molar extinction coefficients. TEM characterization of the C$_{60}$–PhA showed large spherical clusters, with sizes ranging from 150–350 nm, while an elongated wire-type structure was observed for the bisfullerene derivative (C$_{60}$–PhA–C$_{60}$). AFM section analysis studies of isolated nanoclusters of C$_{60}$–PhA–C$_{60}$, deposited on mica, indicate that smaller clusters associate to form larger nanostructures.</p>

					<p>The title transformations are oxygen atom transfer, twin isomerization and regiospecific imine oxidation. \textit{Bis}pyridyldiazole ligands have furnished new oxygen atom transfer reagents of coordination type Re$^V^OCl$_3$(NN) which undergo a slower transfer to PPh$_3$ than the corresponding azole reagents. The rate of twin isomerization (linkage and geometrical) of meridional azole complexes of coordination type Re$^{III}$(OPnP)Cl$_3$(NN) to facial Re$^{III}$(PnPO)Cl$_3$(NN) decreases rapidly as $n$ increases in the interval 1–4 (PnP is Ph$_2$P(CH$_2$)$_n$PPh$_2$). An $\alpha$-diimine chelate of type Re$^V$(NPh)Cl$_3$(NN) is shown to undergo facile oxidation to the corresponding iminoamide complex Re$^{VI}$(NPh)Cl$_3$(NN) upon treating with dilute nitric acid. The reaction proceeds via regiospecific nucleophilic addition of water to the more polarized imine function.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Composites of nanometre-sized copper core–copper oxide shell with diameters in the range 6$\cdot$1 to 7$\cdot$3 nm dispersed in a silica gel were synthesised by a technique comprising reduction followed by oxidation of a suitably chosen precursor gel. The hot pressed gel powders mixed with nanometre-sized copper particles dispersed in silica gel showed electrical resistivities several orders of magnitude lower than that of the precursor gel. Electrical resistivities of the different specimens were measured over the temperature range 30 to 300$^\circ$C. Activation energies for the coreshell nanostructured composites were found to be a fraction of that of the precursor gel. Such dramatic changes are ascribed to the presence of an interfacial amorphous phase. The resistivity variation as a function of temperature was analysed on the basis of Mott’s small polaron hopping conduction model. The effective dielectric constant of the interfacial phase as extracted from the data analysis was found to be much higher than that of the precursor glass. This has been explained as arising from the generation of very high pressure at the interface due to the oxidation step to which the copper nanoparticles are subjected.</p>

Starting from the vibrational ground state at zero time, various TD quantities such as the norm, dissociation probability, potential energy curve and dipole moment are examined. Rich high-harmonics generation (HHG) spectra and above-threshold dissociation (ATD) spectra, due to the multiphoton interaction of vibrational motions with the laser field, and consequent elevation to the vibrational continuum, have been obtained and analysed.</p>

					<p>New organic–inorganic hybrid catalysts were synthesized by covalent grafting of proline and benzylpenicillin derivatives into mesoporous MCM-41. These catalysts were extensively characterized using FT-IR, ${}^{13}$C CP MAS solid state NMR, XRD and TEM techniques. These were used as catalysts for direct, asymmetric aldol reaction between acetone and activated aromatic aldehydes. In the reaction of 4-nitro and 4-fluoro benzaldehyde, the aldol products were obtained in 36$&#37;$ and 59$&#37;$ \textit{ee} respectively. The catalysts were reusable with neither significant drop in enantioselectivity nor loss of mesostructure. An attempt was made to substantiate the proposed `enamine’ mechanism for direct aldol reaction by trapping the intermediate between proline-MCM-41 and acetone.</p>

Core level X-ray photoelectron spectra of Ce $3d$ as well as resonant photoemission spectra obtained at the Ce $4d \Rightarrow 4f$ resonant absorption threshold establish Ce as being in the trivalent state throughout the series. Using the `off-resonance’ condition for Ce $4f$ states, we obtain the Ti $3d$ dominated spectral features close to $E_F$, exhibiting clear signatures of coherent and incoherent peaks. We discuss the implications of our findings in relation to the metal–insulator transition observed in this series of compounds.</p>

					<p>We describe a novel process for the production of nanoparticles of Cu, Ag, Fe and Al which involves exploding their respective wires, triggered by large current densities in the wires. The particles are characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Particle sizes in the range 20–100nm were obtained employing this technique. The XRD results reveal that the nanoparticles continue to retain lattice periodicity at reduced particle sizes, displaying in some cases evidence of lattice strain and preferential orientation. In the case of Fe, Mossbauer spectroscopy reveals loss of ferromagnetism as a result of the reduced size of the particles.</p>

Accordingly the precursor was observed to undergo a number of changes in both the molybdenum (VI) coordination and long-range ordering during this heating. Initially the two other forms of bismuth molybdate ($\alpha$-and $\gamma$-phases) were observed to form from the poorly crystalline precursor at about 230$^\circ$C, however, the $\beta$-phase eventually crystallised after prolonged heating at 560$^\circ$C.</p>

				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0533-0542</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We consider an interacting one-dimensional molecular wire attached to two metal electrodes on either side of it. The electrostatic potential profile across the wire-electrode interface has been deduced solving the Schrodinger and Poisson equations self-consistently. Since the Poisson distribution crucially depends on charge densities, we have considered different Hamiltonian parameters to model the nanoscale wire. We find that for very weak electron correlations, the potential gradient is almost zero in the middle of the wire but are large near the chain ends. However, for strong correlations, the potential is essentially a ramp function. The nonlinear current, obtained from the scattering formalism, is found to be less with the ramp potential than for weak correlations. Some of the interesting features in current–voltage characteristics have been explained using one-electron formalism and instabilities in the system.</p>

				<title>Influence of temperature inhomogeneity on product profile of reactions occurring within zeolites¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0543-0552</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In zeolites, diffusion is often accompanied by a reaction or sorption which in turn can induce temperature inhomogeneities. Monte Carlo simulations of Lennard–Jones atoms in zeolite NaCaA are reported for the presence of a hot zone presumed to be created by a reaction or chemi- or physi-sorption site. These simulations show that the presence of localized hot regions can alter both kinetic and transport properties such as diffusion. Further, we show that enhancement of diffusion constant is greater for systems with larger barrier height, a surprising result that may be of considerable significance in many chemical and biological processes. We find an unanticipated coupling between reaction and diffusion due to the presence of a hot zone in addition to that which normally exists via concentration. Implications of this coupling for the product profile of a reaction are discussed. We also propose a mechanism by which mobility of ions or diffusion of molecular species within biomembranes may take place.</p>

					<p>The results of X-ray diffraction, and ac and dc magnetisation as a function of temperature are reported for a new class of spin-chain oxides, Ca$_3$Co$_{1+x}$Ir$_{1–x}O$_6$. While the $x = 0 \cdot 0$, $0 \cdot  3$, $0 \cdot 5$ and $1 \cdot 0$ are found to form in the K$_4$CdCl$_6$-derived rhombhohedral (space group $R\bar{3}c$) structure, the $x = 0 \cdot 7$ composition is found to undergo a monoclinic distortion in contrast to a literature report. Apparently, the change in the crystal symmetry with x manifests itself as a change in the sign of paramagnetic Curie temperature for this composition as though magnetic coupling sensitively depends on such crystallographic distortions. All the compositions exhibit spin-glass anomalies with an unusually \textit{large} frequency dependence of the peak temperature in $ac$ susceptibility in a temperature range below 50 K, interestingly obeying Vogel–Fulcher relationship even for the stoichiometric compounds.</p>

The resulting materials were characterised by TGA, XRD, UV-Vis-DRS, EPR, SEM and surface area measurements. XRD and DRS results indicated fine dispersion of the ceria component in the ZnO matrix. EPR results clearly indicate the presence of oxygen vacancy and defect centres in the composite oxide. Addition of CeO$_2$ to ZnO produced mixed oxides of high surface area compared to the pure ZnO. Hydrogen transfer reaction was carried out on these catalytic materials to investigate the effect of rare earth oxide on the activity of ZnO. Addition of ceria into zinc oxide was found to increase the catalytic activity for hydrogen transfer reaction. The catalytic activity also depended on the method of preparation.

					<p>A hydrothermal reaction of a mixture of Y(NO$_3$)$_3$, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid (1,2-BDC) and NaOH gives rise to a new yttrium phthalate coordination polymer, [Y$_4$(H$_2$O)$_2$(C$_8$H$_4$O$_4$)$_6$]$_\infty$, {\bf I}. The Y ions in {\bf I} are present in four different coordination environments with respect to the oxygen atoms (CN6 = octahedral, CN7 = pentagonal bipyramid, CN8 = dodecahedron and CN9 =capped square antiprism). The oxygen atoms of the 1,2-BDC are fully deprotonated, and show variations in their connectivity with Y atoms. The Y atoms themselves are connected through their vertices forming infinite Y–O–Y one-dimensional chains. The Y–O–Y chains are cross-linked by the 1,2-BDC anions forming a corrugated layer structure. The layers are supported by favourable $\pi \ldots \pi$ interactions between the benzene rings of the 1,2-BDC anions. The variations in the coordination environment of the Y atoms and the presence of Y–O–Y interactions along with the favourable $\pi \ldots \pi$ interactions between the benzene rings from different layers are noteworthy structural features. Crystal data: triclinic, space group = $P–1$ (no. 2), $a = 12 \cdot 6669$ (2), $b = 13 \cdot 8538$ (2), $c = 16 \cdot 0289$ Å, $a = 75 \cdot 20$ (1), $\beta = 69 \cdot 012$ (1), $\gamma = 65 \cdot 529$ (1)°, $V = 2371 \cdot 28$ (7) Å$^3$, $D_{\text{calc}} = 1 \cdot 922$ g cm$^{–1}$, $\mu_{\text(MoK\alpha)} = 4 \cdot 943$ mm$^{–1}$.

				<title>Properties of CMR composites¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0587-0606</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) composites form an interesting field of study. The intrinsic CMR, governed by the intragrain transport of the conduction electrons through the double exchange, limits its application owing to the high field requirement and generally low transition temperatures. Extrinsic CMR, a function of the intergrain transport between ferromagnetic (FM) particles, plays a crucial role in enhancing low field magnetoresistance (LFMR) or increasing room temperature magnetoresistance. Since extrinsic CMR is a grain boundary controlled phenomena, magnetically dirty grain boundaries in the virgin state of the sample help in achieving a high LFMR or increase the field sensitivity. In this article, we give the properties of different composites of magnetoresistive LCMO or LSMO where the second component is (a) an insulating phase, (b) a conducting phase, (c) a nonmagnetic phase and (d) a magnetic phase. We present here some of our recent work on CMR composites where the CMR phase is chosen as LCMO and SiO$_2$, ZnO, ZrO$_2$ and SiCN have been used as the different second phase of the composites. We summarise some of the salient features of the results.</p>

				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0613-0619</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nanoparticles have properties that can be fine-tuned by their size as well as shape. Hence, there is significant current interest in preparing nano-materials of small size dispersity and to arrange them in close-packed aggregates. This manuscript describes ways of synthesising gold nanoparticles using a metal-chelator derivative {\bf 1}, as stabiliser. Controlled synthesis conditions lead to formation of nanoparticles thereby indicating the ability of {\bf 1} to act as efficient stabiliser. The nanoparticles formed were characterised by transmission electron microscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. TEM analysis showed the formation of dense aggregates of nanoparticles. This can be ascribed to the inter-particle hydrogen bonding possible by the carboxylic acid moiety of {\bf 1} that leads to aggregation. The aggregation can be controlled by the pH of the solution employed for dispersing the particles.</p>

				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0621-0636</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Folding dynamics and energy landscape picture of protein conformations of HP-36 and $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) are investigated by extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, where the inter amino acid interactions are given by a minimalistic model (MM) we recently introduced [\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 118} 4733 (2003)]. In this model, a protein is constructed by taking two atoms for each amino acid. One atom represents the backbone C$_{\alpha}$ atom, while the other mimics the whole side chain residue. Sizes and interactions of the side residues are all different and specific to a particular amino acid. The effect of water-mediated folding is mapped into the MM by suitable choice of interaction parameters of the side residues obtained from the amino acid hydropathy scale. A new non-local helix potential is incorporated to generate helices at the appropriate positions in a protein. Simulations have been done by equilibrating the protein at high temperature followed by a sudden quench. The subsequent folding is monitored to observe the dynamics of topological contacts ($N_{topo}$), relative contact order parameter (RCO), and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the realprotein native structure. The folded structures of different model proteins (HP-36 and $A\beta$) resemble their respective real native state rather well. The dynamics of folding shows \textit{multistage decay}, with an initial hydrophobic collapse followed by a long plateau. Analysis of $N_{topo}$ and RCO correlates the late stage folding with rearrangement of the side chain residues, particularly those far apart in the sequence. The long plateau also signifies large entropic free energy barrier near the native state, as predicted from theories of protein folding.</p>

				<title>Aromaticity in benzene-like rings – An experimental electron density investigation¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0637-0647</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An experimental charge density study has been carried out on perylene based on X-ray diffraction measurements at 130 K. The electron density and its associated properties have been evaluated at the bond and the ring critical points for the naphthalene residues as well as for the central ring. The variation of the Laplacian along the axis, above and below the ring plane, is found to be symmetric for the central ring while for the naphthalene rings, the Laplacian values are enhanced under the bow-shaped region. A plot of the Laplacian versus density evaluated at various points along the axis above the ring plane, shows a steep variation in the case of the central ring implying that the $\pi$-density is smeared out compared to that over the naphthalene rings. Similar data extracted from a quinoid ring and a regular phenyl ring (both based on earlier reports from this laboratory) exhibit increasingly shallower trends and indicate, by contrast, that the central ring of perylene is much less aromatic.</p>

				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0663-0677</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of $n$-hexane on the basal plane of graphite at monolayer and multilayer coverages. In keeping with experimental data, we find the presence of ordered adsorbed layers both at single monolayer coverage and when the adsorbed layer coexists with excess liquid adsorbate. Using a simulation method that does not impose any particular periodicity on the adsorbed layer, we quantitatively compare our results to the results of neutron diffraction experiments and find a structural transition from a uniaxially incommensurate lattice to a fully commensurate structure on increasing the coverage from a monolayer to a multilayer. The zig-zag backbone planes of all the alkane molecules lie parallel to the graphite surface at the multilayer coverage, while a few molecules are observed to attain the perpendicular orientation at monolayer coverage.</p>

				<title>Water-dispersible nanoparticles via interdigitation of sodium dodecylsulphate molecules in octadecylamine-capped gold nanoparticles at a liquid–liquid interface¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0679-0687</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the formation of water-dispersible gold nanoparticles capped with a bilayer of sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) and octadecylamine (ODA) molecules. Vigorous shaking of a biphasic mixture consisting of ODA-capped gold nanoparticles in chloroform and SDS in water results in the rapid phase transfer of ODA-capped gold nanoparticles from the organic to the aqueous phase, the latter acquiring a pink, foam-like appearance in the process. Drying of the coloured aqueous phase results in the formation of a highly stable, reddish powder of gold nanoparticles that may be readily redispersed in water. The water-dispersible gold nanoparticles have been investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). These studies indicate the presence of interdigitated bilayers consisting of an ODA primary monolayer directly coordinated to the gold nanoparticle surface and a secondary monolayer of SDS, this secondary monolayer providing sufficient hydrophilicity to facilitate gold nanoparticle transfer into water and rendering them water-dispersible.</p>

				<title>A low-cost Raman spectrometer design used to study Raman scattering from a single-walled carbon nanotube¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0689-0694</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper discusses the design of a low cost Raman spectrometer. Singlewalled nanotubes (SWNT) have been studied to demonstrate the reach of such a system. We observe both the radial-breathing mode (RBM) and the tangential mode from the SWNT. The tube diameters of the SWNT used in these experiments have been determined using RBM to be predominantly 1$\cdot$4 and 1$\cdot$6nm. These are consistent with the TEM images taken of the same sample. The new method of producing SWNT using Ni–Y catalyst in electric-arc discharge method produces nanotubes with very small dispersion in diameter and high yields. The chirality of the SWNT can be deduced from their radial breathing modes, and it suggests that they are metallic in nature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Y$_2$W$_3$O$_{12}$ exhibits negative thermal expansion along the three crystallographic directions due to the transverse thermal vibrations perpendicular to the Y–O–W linkage. It is highly hygroscopic and forms a trihydrate structure at room temperature. Dilatometric studies of Y$_2$W$_3$O$_{12}$ show large thermal expansion hysteresis due to large grain size and a large initial positive thermal expansion due to the removal of water molecules. Al$_2$O$_3$ has been added to Y$_2$W$_3$O$_{12}$ up to 10 wt$&#37;$ in an attempt to overcome the hygroscopicity and reduce the particle size and thereby the thermal expansion hysteresis. Thermo gravimetric, dilatometric and electron microscopic studies are presented to support these observations.</p>

The material has been characterised using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and emission spectroscopy. The material is stable and the freestanding particles can be precipitated and redispersed in several solvents. Confinement of the molecule is complete as leaching through the shell is minimal. The material behaves like free ciprofloxacin in solution; however, effects of confinement are manifested. Energy transfer reaction between ciprofloxacin$&#64;$SiO$_2$ and Tb$^{3+}$ was monitored by emission spectroscopy. The emission intensity decreased with metal ion exposure indicating selective electronic interaction.</p>

				<title>Heptaphyrins: Expanded porphyrins with seven heterocyclic rings¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0711-0720</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Expanded porphyrins containing seven pyrrole/heterocyclic rings linked in a cyclic fashion are termed heptaphyrins. The number of $\pi$-electrons in heptaphyrins depends on the number of \textit{meso} carbon bridges used to link the heterocyclic rings, accordingly heptaphyrins with $28\pi$-electrons and 30 $\pi$-electrons are reported to date. Both condensation reactions of the appropriate precursors and acid-catalysed oxidative coupling reactions have been utilized to synthesise the heptaphyrins. The 30$\pi$ heptaphyrins exhibit rich structural diversity where some of the heterocyclic rings in the macrocycle undergo a 180$^{\circ}$ ring flipping. An overview of the synthetic methods employed for the synthesis of heptaphyrins, their spectroscopic properties, structural behaviour and aromatic properties are highlighted in this paper.</p>

The dppe-yl behaves as an ambidentate ligand; it functions as a monodentate P-donor ligand with a dangling ylidic carbon in the neutral chloro complex, [(COD)Rh(Cl)(dppe-yl)] ({\bf 1}), whereas replacement of the chloride by a non-coordinating counter anion results in the formation of the complexes, [(COD)Rh(L-L')]$^+$ (L-L' = dppe-yl ({\bf 2}) or dppm-yl ({\bf 3})) respectively in which the ligands are bonded to the metal via the phosphorus and the ylidic carbon atoms.

				<title>Investigations on geometrical features in induced ordering of collagen by small molecules¶</title>
				<feature>Emerging Directions in Chemical Sciences</feature>
				<page>0751-0766</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Binding energies of the interaction of collagen like triple helical peptides with a series of polyphenols, viz. gallic acid, catechin, epigallocatechingallate and pentagalloylglucose have been computed using molecular modelling approaches. A correlation of calculated binding energies with the interfacial molecular volumes involved in the interaction is observed. Calculated interface surface areas for the binding of polyphenols with collagen-like triple helical peptides vary in the range of 60–210 Å$^2$ and hydrogen bond lengths vary in the range of 2$\cdot$7–3$\cdot$4 Å. Interfacial molecular volumes can be calculated from the solvent inaccessible surface areas and hydrogen bond lengths involved in the binding of polyphenols to collagen. Molecular aggregation of collagen in the presence of some polyphenols and chromium (III) salts has been probed experimentally in monolayer systems. The monolayer arrangement of collagen seems to be influenced by the presence of small molecules like formaldehyde, gluteraldehyde, tannic acid and chromium (III) salts. A fractal structure is observed on account of two-dimensional aggregation of collagen induced by tanning species. Atomic force microscopy has been employed to probe the topographic images of two-dimensional aggregation of collagen induced by chromium (III) salts. A case is made that long-range ordering of collagen by molecular species involved in its stabilisation is influenced by molecular geometries involved in its interaction with small molecules.</p>

				<title>Colossal magnetoresistance manganites: A new approach¶</title>

				<page>0767-0774</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Manganites of the LA$_{1–x}$Ca$_x$MnO$_3$ family show a variety of new and poorly understood electronic, magnetic and structural effects. Here we outline a new approach recently proposed by us, where we argue that due to strong Jahn–Teller (JT) coupling with phonons the twofold degenerate $e_g$ states at the Mn sites dynamically reorganize themselves into localised, JT polarons $\ell$ with exponentially small inter-site hopping, and band-like, nonpolaronic states $b$, leading to a \textit{new 2-band model for manganites} which includes strong Coulomb and Hund’s couplings. We also discuss some results from a dynamical mean-field theory treatment of the model which explains quantitatively a wide variety of experimental results, including insulator– metal transitions and CMR, in terms of the influence of physical conditions on the relative energies and occupation of the $\ell$ and $b$ states. We argue that this microscopic coexistence of the two types of electronic states, and their relative occupation and spatial correlation is the key to manganite physics.</p>

					<p>Relaxor properties of 0$\cdot$7Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$–0$\cdot$3PbTiO$_{3}$ (PMN-PT) and non-lead perovskite thin films have been analysed in terms of large frequency dispersion of dielectric response at low temperatures. A wide spectrum of dielectric relaxation was observed in the frequency-dependent response of the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity. Transformation from normal ferroelectric to relaxor behaviour has been observed in the case of the Ca substituting the BaTiO$_3$ thin films. A number of techniques were exploited to investigate the wide spectrum of relaxation times in pulsed laser ablated thin films. $ac$ and $dc$ electric field induced complex dielectric properties of 0$\cdot$7Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$–0$\cdot$3PbTiO$_3$ (PMN-PT) thin films were studied as function of frequencies at different temperatures. Nonlinear behaviour of dielectric susceptibility with respect to the amplitude of the $ac$ drive was observed at lower temperatures. The frequency dependence of transition temperature $T_m$ (temperature of the maximum of dielectric constant) was studied using the Vogel–Fulcher relation.</p>

				<title>A study of partial molar volumes of citric acid and tartaric acid in water and binary aqueous mixtures of ethanol at various temperatures</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0033-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Partial molar volumes of citric acid and tartaric acid have been determined in water and binary aqueous mixtures of ethanol (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25$&#37;$ by weight of ethanol) at different temperatures and acid concentrations from the solution density measurements. The data have been evaluated by using Masson equation and the obtained parameters have been interpreted in terms of solute–solvent interactions. The partial molar volumes vary with temperature as a power series of temperature. Structure making/breaking capacities of the organic acids have been inferred from the sign of [$\partial^{2} \phi^0_v/ T^2$]$_p$, i.e. secondderivative of partial molar volume with respect to temperature at constant pressure. Both the organic acids behave as structure breakers in water and water $+$ ethanol.</p>

				<title>Excess molar volumes and viscosities of binary mixtures of some polyethers with 1-propanol at 288$\cdot$15, 298$\cdot$15, and 308$\cdot$15 K</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Excess molar volumes ($V_m^E$) and viscosities ($\eta$) have been measured as a function of composition for binary liquid mixtures of 1-propanol, C$_3$H$_7$OH, with diethylene glycol diethyl ether (\textit{bis}(2-ethoxyethyl)ether), C$_2$H$_5$(OC$_2$H$_4$)$_2$OC$_2$H$_5$, and diethylene glycol dibutyl ether (\textit{bis}(2-butoxyethyl)ether), C$_4$H$_9$(OC$_2$H$_4$)$_2$OC$_4$H$_9$, at 288$\cdot$15, 298$\cdot$15, and 308$\cdot$15 K and at atmospheric pressure. The excess volume results included the following mixing quantities at all range of concentrations and at equimolar concentrations: $\alpha$, volume expansivity; ($\partial V^E_m/\partial T$)$_P$, and ($\partial H^E/\partial P$)$_T$ at 298$\cdot$15 K. The obtained results were then compared with the calculated values by using the Flory theory of liquid mixtures. The theory predicts the $\alpha$ values rather well, while the calculated values of ($\partial V^E_m/\partial T$)$_P$ and ($\partial H^E/\partial P$)$_T$ show variation with alkyl chain length of the polyether. The results are discussed in terms of order or disorder creation. From the viscosity data, deviations in viscosity ($\Delta \eta$) have been calculated. These values are negative over the entire range of composition. The results for $V^E_m$, and $\Delta \eta$ are discussed in terms of interaction between components.</p>

				<title>Anodically generated manganese(III) sulphate for the oxidation of dipeptides in aqueous sulphuric acid medium: A kinetic study</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0049-0053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetic of oxidation of dipeptides (DP) namely valyl–glycine (Val–Gly), alanyl–glycine (Ala–Gly) and glycyl–glycine (Gly–Gly), by Mn(III) have been studied in the presence of sulphate ions in acid medium at 26$^\circ$C. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ = 500 nm. A firstorder dependence of the rate on both [Mn(III)]$_o$ and [DP]$_o$ was observed. The rate is independent of the concentration of reduction product, Mn(II) and hydrogen ions. The effects of varying the dielectric constant of the medium and addition of anions such as sulphate, chloride and perchlorate were studied. The activation parameters have been evaluated using Arrhenius and Eyring plots. The oxidation products were isolated and characterized. A mechanism involving the reaction of DP with Mn(III) in the ratelimiting step is suggested. An apparent correlation was noted between the rate of oxidation and the hydrophobicity of these dimers, where increased hyphobicity results in increased rate of oxidation.</p>

					<p>A series of covalently linked bisporphyrins bearing meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and octabromotetraphenylporphyrin (OBTPP) units have been synthesised and characterised. Electrochemical studies on these bisporphyrins showed an anodic shift ($\tilde$ 30–60 mV) of the TPP unit and a cathodic shift ($\tilde$ 40–80 mV) of OBTPP in redox potentials. Further, steady-state fluorescence studies on bisporphyrins indicated dramatic decrease in fluorescence quantum yields of the TPP moiety. Electrochemical redox and fluorescence data seem to suggest the possible existence of intramolecular interactions in these bisporphyrins.</p>

				<title>Molecular orbital studies on the Wagner–Meerwein migration in some acyclic pinacol–pinacolone rearrangements</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0083-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The semi-empirical PM3 SCF-MO method is used to investigate the Wagner–Meerwein migration of various groups during the pinacol–pinacolone rearrangement of some acyclic systems. Pinacol first protonates and dehydrates to form a carbocation that undergoes a 1,2-migration to form a protonated ketone, which then deprotonates to yield the pinacolone product. We study the Wagner–Meerwein migration of hydride, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, phenyl and heterocylic $2-$, $3-$ and $4-$pyridyl groups in various acyclic 1,2-diol (pinacol) systems as they rearrange to pinacolones. This 1,2-migration involves a three-centred moiety in the cationic transition state. The migratory aptitude predicted here follows the order: hydride $$ $t$-butyl $&gt;$ isopropyl $&gt;$ ethyl $&gt;$ methyl $&gt;$ phenyl, which accords well with available experimental data and/or chemical intuition, reflecting also on the ability of the group involved to carry positive charge in the transition state. The structure of the migrating group (whether aliphatic or aromatic) within the transition state also supports the stabilising role of delocalisation of positive charge for reaction feasibility. Geometrical and thermodynamic considerations coincide in assigning the following order to relative ``earliness” of the transition state along the reaction pathway: $t$-butyl $&gt;$ isopropyl $&gt;$ phenyl $&gt;$ methyl $&gt;$ 2-pyridyl $&gt;$ 4-pyridyl.</p>

				<page>0101-0106</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of eleven amino acids by tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) in aqueous acetic acid results in the formation of the corresponding carbonyl compounds and ammonia. The reaction is first order with respect to TBATB. Michaelis–Menten type kinetics is observed with some of the amino acids while others exhibit second-order dependence. It failed to induce polymerization of acrylonitrile. The effect of solvent composition indicate that the rate of reaction increases with increase in the polarity of the medium. Addition of tetrabutylammonium chloride has no effect on the rate of oxidation. Addition of bromide ion causes decrease in the oxidation rate but only to a limiting value. The reaction is susceptible to both polar and steric effects of the substituents. A suitable mechanism has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Large pore aluminophosphate-based molecular sieves like AlPO$_4$-5, MAPO-5, MnAPO-5 and ZAPO-5 were synthesised hydrothermally using triethylamine as a structure directing agent. These materials were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), ${}^{27}$Al and ${}^{31}$P MAS-NMR, ICP-MS, $n$-butylamine- TPD, BET and SEM. The catalytic performance of these materials was tested for isopropylation of benzene with 2-propanol at 250, 300, 350 and 400$^{\circ}$C. The products were cumene, $p$-DIPB ($p$-diisopropylbenzene) and $m$-DIPB ($m$-diisopropylbenzene). MnAPO-5 was found to be more active than the other catalysts. Maximum conversion (20$&#37;$) was noted at 350$^\circ$C over MnAPO-5. The selectivity to DIPB was found to decrease with time on stream but the selectivity to cumene showed an increase after 3 h of time on stream.</p>

The rate of polymerization is proportional to [MBA] and [AH$_2$].

				<abstract>
					<p>Equilibrium constants are determined for the reaction of ethylester and methyl ester (aquo) cobaloximes with histamine, histidine, glycine and ethyl glycine ester as a function of pH at 25$^\circ$C, using spectrophotometric technique. The functional dependence of pKa on the substitution rate of H$_2$O varies with the p$K_a$ of the incoming ligand, establishing the existence of nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. This data is interpreted with the help of kinetic data where dissociation kinetic reactions were also studied as a function of pH. Binding and kinetic data were correlated based on the basicity, steric hindrance of the entering ligand and HSAB principle. To compare the rate constants of the entering ligands pH-independent second-order rate constants were calculated. The effect of incoming ligand on Co–C bond is studied using molecular mechanics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Low-temperature stoichiometric Schiff base reaction in air in 3 : 1 mole ratio between benzaldehyde and triethylenetetramine (trien) in methanol yields a novel tetraaza m-bis(bidentate) acyclic ligand L. It was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, EI mass and NMR (${}^1$H and ${}^{13}$C) spectra. The formation of a five-membered imidazolidine ring from the ethylenediamine backbone as a spacer-cumbridging unit gives rise to a new type of imidazolidine-bridged ligand. A geometric optimisation was made of the synthesized ligand and its complexes by the method of molecular mechanics (MM2) method in order to establish the stable conformations. This hitherto unknown tetraaza acyclic ligand affords new cationic dicopper(I/I) and dicopper(II/II) complexes in good yield. Dicopper(II/II) complex displays weak $d–d$ transition bands in the visible region, while dicopper(I/I) complex displays strong MLCT band in the same region. Both the dinuclear complexes are of non-intimate nature and show interesting solution electrochemical behaviour. EPR spectral study of $\mu$-\textit{bis}(imidazolidino) bridged dicopper(II/II) complex also supports the non-communicative nature of the two copper centres within the same molecule.</p>

				<title>Proline-catalysed asymmetric ketol cyclizations: The template mechanism revisited</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0159-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A modified template mechanism based on modelling studies of energy minimised complexes is presented for the asymmetric proline-catalysed cyclization of triketones {\bf 1}, {\bf 2} and {\bf 3} to the $2S$, $3S$-ketols {\bf 1a}, {\bf 2a} and {\bf 3a} respectively. The template model involves a three-point contact as favoured in enzyme–substrate interactions. Our minimisation studies are in agreement with the divergent behaviour of the $6,5-$, $6,6-$ and $6,7-$bicyclic systems. They support the high 93.4$&#37;$ ee observed with the 6,5-bicyclic ketol and the lower 73$&#37;$ \textit{ee} found with the 6,6-bicyclic ketol. The calculations also explain the lack of asymmetric induction with the 6,7-bicyclic system.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0169-0174</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In an effort to design agents that could solubilize silica in water, under ambient conditions and pH, as takes place in nature, novel zwitterionic, penta-oxo-coordinated silicon compounds with siliconate cores have been prepared from 4-substituted pyridine N-oxides (H, OMe, morpholino, NO$_2$) as donor ligands, their structures established by 1H, 13C and MS, and the coordination number of silicon, by ${}^{29}$Si NMR. The formation of complexes from pyridine N-oxides is noteworthy since they arise from interaction with a weakly nucleophilic oxygen centre. The ability of the pyridine N-oxides to enhance the solubilization of silica in water has been experimentally demonstrated. Possible rationalization of this observation on the basis of O$\rightarrow$Si coordination via the oxygen atom of pyridine N-oxide is suggested.</p>

				<title>Sugar amino acids and related molecules: Some recent developments</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0187-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To meet the growing demands for the development of new molecular entities for discovering new drugs and materials, organic chemists have started working on many new concepts that can help to assimilate knowledge-based structural diversities more efficiently than ever before. Emulating the basic principles followed by Nature to build its vast repertoire of biomolecules, organic chemists are developing many novel multifunctional building blocks and using them to create `nature-like’ and yet unnatural organic molecules. Sugar amino acids constitute an important class of such polyfunctional scaffolds where the carboxyl, amino and hydroxyl termini provide an excellent opportunity to organic chemists to create structural diversities akin to Nature’s molecular arsenal. In recent years, sugar amino acids have been used extensively in the area of peptidomimetic studies. Advances made in the area of combinatorial chemistry can provide the necessary technological support for rapid compilations of sugar amino acidbased libraries exploiting the diversities of their carbohydrate frameworks and well-developed solidphase peptide synthesis methods. This perspective article chronicles some of the recent applications of various sugar amino acids, furan amino acids, pyrrole amino acids etc. and many other related building blocks in wide-ranging peptidomimetic studies.</p>

The monomeric and non-electrolytic nature of the complexes is evidenced by their magnetic susceptibility and low conductance data. The electrochemical property of the ligand and its complexes in acetonitrile solution was studied by cyclic voltammetry. The X-band ESR spectra of the Cu(II) complex in DMSO at 300 and 77 K were recorded and their salient features are reported.</p>

				<title>Basicities of some 9-substituted acridine-4-carboxamides: A density functional theory (DFT) calculation</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0235-0241</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Acid–base properties of drugs are important in understanding the behaviour of these compounds under physiological condition. In order to understand such behaviour the proton affinities of acridine 4-carboxamides with substitution (R) at the 9-position are theoretically studied, and considered for the basic sites of both the heterocyclic ring as well as side chain nitrogens. In 9-amino acridine 4-carboxamide, the –NH2 group is observed to be an additional basic site. The heterocyclic nitrogen of substituted carboxamides (R = –NH$_2$, –O-methyl, –O-ethyl, and –O-phenyl) is more basic than the side chain nitrogen, however, side chain nitrogen corresponds to more basic site for some carboxamides (R = –OH and –Cl) and the –NH2 group represents the least basic site of 9-amino acridine 4-carboxamide. In addition to presenting the basicities of these drugs an indication of another hydrogen-bond between heterocyclic ring N and carboxamide chain O is observed. The difference of basicities with substituents at 9-position are very narrow and carboxamides with substituents at 9-position are found to be suitable for studying intramolecular H-bonds between the heterocyclic N and carboxamide O. The resultant stabilization of a configuration due to such H-bonding is determined.</p>

					<p>The reaction of Ru(RL$^{1}$)(PPh$_3$)$_2$(CO)Cl, {\bf 1}, with quinolin-8-ol (HQ) has afforded complexes of the type [Ru(RL$^2$)(PPh$_3$)$_2$(CO)(Q)], {\bf 3}, in excellent yield (RL$^1$ is C$_6$H$_2$O-2-CHNHC$_6$H$_4$R($p$)-3-Me-5, RL$^2$ is C$_6$H$_2$OH-2-CHNC$_6$H$_4$R($p$)-3-Me-5 and R is Me, OMe, Cl). In this process, quinolin-8-olato (Q) undergoes five-membered chelation, the iminium-phenolato function tautomerizing to the imine-phenol function. In dichloromethane solution, {\bf 3} displays a quasireversible {\bf 3}$^+$/{\bf 3} couple near 0×50 V vs SCE ({\bf 3}$^+$ is the ruthenium (III) analogue of {\bf 3}). Coulometrically generated solutions of {\bf 3}$^+$ display a strong absorption near 395 nm associated with a shoulder near 475 nm and rhombic EPR spectra with $g$ values near 2$\cdot$55, 2$\cdot$13, 1$\cdot$89. Solutions of {\bf 3} absorb near 415 nm and emit near 510 nm at 298 K and 585 nm at 77 K. The fluorescence is believed to originate from the ${}^3$MLCT state.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The complexes [MoX$_4$]$^{2–}$ (M = Mo; X = O or S) exist as the monomeric tetrahedral species in aqueous alkaline solutions. Acidification of tetraoxomolybdate results in the condensation of the tetrahedral units via a series of polyoxomolybdates leading to the ultimate formation of the trioxide MoO3. Heptamolybdate [Mo$_7$O$_{24}$]$^{6–}$ is the first major polyanion of the acidification reaction. In contrast, acidification of tetrathiomolybdates leads to the formation of amorphous molybdenum trisulphide via a dinuclear Mo(V) complex. The formation of the dinuclear Mo(V) complex precludes the formation of any higher nuclearity Mo(VI)-S complexes in aqueous solution. Thus it is shown that the all-sulphur analogue of heptamolybdate [Mo$_7$S$_{2$}$]$^{6–}$ does not exist in alkaline medium and also cannot be isolated from aqueous acidic medium.</p>

The variations of relative energies and stabilities of the core-modified analogues were compared with parent porphyrin {\bf 1} and the corresponding oxa- and thia-analogues. The trends in relative energies are not significantly changed while going from parent system to oxa- and thia-core-modified porphyrins in case of both syn and anti tautomers. Isomers of types [2$\cdot$2$\cdot$0$\cdot$0], [3$\cdot$0$\cdot$1$\cdot$0], [3$\cdot$1$\cdot$0$\cdot$0], and [4$\cdot$0$\cdot$0$\cdot$0] are destabilized due to the absence of methine bridge, which results in angle strain for tetrapyrroles.

				<title>Phase transfer of platinum nanoparticles from aqueous to organic solutions using fatty amine molecules</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0293-0300</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this report we demonstrate a simple process based on amine chemistry for the phase transfer of platinum nanoparticles from an aqueous to an organic solution. The phase transfer was accomplished by vigorous shaking of a biphasic mixture of platinum nanoparticles synthesised in an aqueous medium and octadecylamine (ODA) in hexane. During shaking of the biphasic mixture, the aqueous platinum nanoparticles complex via either coordination bond formation or weak covalent interaction with the ODA molecules present in the organic phase. This process renders the nanoparticles sufficiently hydrophobic and dispersible in the organic phase. The ODA-stabilised platinum nanoparticles could be separated out from hexane in the form of a powder that is readily redispersible in weakly polar and nonpolar organic solvents. The ODA-capped platinum nanoparticles show high catalytic activity in hydrogenation reactions and this is demonstrated in the efficient conversion of styrene to ethyl benzene. The nature of binding of the ODA molecules to the platinum nanoparticles surface was characterised by thermogravimetry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).</p>

				<page>0333-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of lactic acid, mandelic acid and ten monosubstituted mandelic acids by hexamethylenetetramine-bromine (HABR) in glacial acetic acid, leads to the formation of the corresponding oxoacid. The reaction is first order with respect to each of the hydroxy acids and HABR. It is proposed that HABR itself is the reactive oxidizing species. The oxidation of $\alpha$-deuteriomandelic acid exhibits the presence of a substantial kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 5 \cdot 91$ at 298 K). The rates of oxidation of the substituted mandelic acids show excellent correlation with Brown’s $\sigma^+$ values. The reaction constants are negative. The oxidation exhibits an extensive cross conjugation between the electron-donating substituent and the reaction centre in the transition state. A mechanism involving transfer of a hydride ion from the acid to the oxidant is postulated.</p>

				<title>NMR of unfolded proteins</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0003-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the post-genomic era, as more and more genome sequences are becoming known and hectic efforts are underway to decode the information content in them, it is becoming increasingly evident that flexibility in proteins plays a crucial role in many of the biological functions. Many proteins have intrinsic disorder either wholly or in specific regions. It appears that this disorder may be important for regulatory functions of the proteins, on the one hand, and may help in directing the folding process to reach the compact native state, on the other. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has over the last two decades emerged as the sole, most powerful technique to help characterize these disordered protein systems. In this review, we first discuss the significance of disorder in proteins and then describe the recent developments in NMR methods for their characterization. A brief description of the results obtained on several disordered proteins is presented at the end.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of ruthenium (III) catalyzed oxidation of atenolol by permanganate in alkaline medium at constant ionic strength of 0$\cdot$30 mol dm$^3$ has been studied spectrophotometrically using a rapid kinetic accessory. Reaction between permanganate and atenolol in alkaline medium exhibits 1 : 8 stoichiometry (atenolol : KMnO$_4$). The reaction shows first-order dependence on [permanganate] and [ruthenium (III)] and apparently less than unit order on both atenolol and alkali concentrations. Reaction rate decreases with increase in ionic strength and increases with decreasing dielectric constant of the medium. Initial addition of reaction products does not affect the rate significantly. A mechanism involving the formation of a complex between catalyst and substrate has been proposed. The active species of ruthenium (III) is understood as [Ru(H$_2$O)$_5$OH]$^{2+}$. The reaction constants involved in the different steps of mechanism are calculated. Activation parameters with respect to the slow step of the mechanism are computed and discussed and thermodynamic quantities are also calculated.</p>

					<p>Silver nanosized crystallites have been synthesized in aqueous and polyols viz., ethylene glycol and glycerol, using a microwave technique. Dispersions of colloidal silver have been prepared by the reduction of silver nitrate both in the presence and absence of stabilizer poly(vinylpyrolidone) (PVP). It was observed that PVP is capable of complexing and stabilizing Ag nanoparticles formed through the reduction of Ag$^+$ ions in water and ethylene glycol. In the case of ethylene glycol, it has been shown that the use of PVP leads to particles with a high degree of stability. The colloids are stable in glycerol for months even in the absence of stabilizer.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Octamethoxyporphyrin containing multiple-donor substituents has been functionalized for the first time. A large number of its mono-meso-substituted derivatives with substituents such as nitro, amino, N-methylamino, formyl, hydroxymethyl, oxime, cyano and carboxy functional groups have been synthesized and characterized. They form a new class of nonasubstituted porphyrins. Crystallographic studies on the cyano derivative show that the –C N group is in conjugation with the prophyrin $\pi$-system. The calculated optical transition energies and the electron densities on the imino nitrogens of the synthesised porphyrins using AMI calculations correlate well with the experimentally observed data. Mesosubstituted porphyrins are found to be essentially planar.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The sulphhydryl environment in various mixed-metal hybrid hemoglobins, viz. $\alpha_2$(Cu)-$\beta_2(FeCO)$, $\alpha_2$(FeCO)-$\beta_2$(Cu), $\alpha_2$(Cu)-$\beta_2$(Ni), $\alpha_2$(Ni)-$\beta_2$(Cu), was studied by reacting them with the sulphhydryl reagent, 4,4'-dithiodipyridine (4-PDS). The reactivity was compared with that of HbCO, NiHb and CuHb. It is found that there exists a correlation between conformational change and metal ion environment, not only at the extreme R and T states but also the intermediate conformations. EPR examinations of these hybrids show that both in 4R$ \textit{state}-[Cu(II)-Fe(II)] and $T$ \textit{state}-[Cu(II)-Ni(II)] hybrids at neutral pH and in the absence of IHP, CuPPIX, irrespective of the subunit in which it is present, has a mixed-metal ion environment: Species 1, a five-coordinated Cu$^{2+}$ complex with strong proximal histidine bond and species 2, a four-coordinated complex without any covalent linkage with N$\varepsilon$ F8-histidine.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, photophysical and metal ion signalling behaviour of mono- and di-azacrown derivatives of 4-aminophthalimide</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0105-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, photophysical behaviour and metal ion signalling ability of 3-component systems, {\bf I} and {\bf II}, comprising a 4-aminophthalimido moiety as \textit{fluorophore}, a dimethylene \textit{spacer} and two different azacrown \textit{receptors}, are reported. The fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes of both the systems have been found to be significantly lower than that of the parent fluorophore indicating the occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the terminal moieties. PET is found to be more efficient in {\bf II}, presumably due to the presence of more than one electron-donating centre in the receptor moiety. Fluorescence decay behaviour of the systems suggests a \textit{through-space} nature of PET. The systems exhibit \textit{off–on} fluorescence signalling in the aprotic media in the presence of several metal ions, some of which are well known for their fluorescence quenching abilities. Diazacrown derivative, {\bf II}, appears to be a somewhat better signalling system than the monoazacrown derivative, {\bf I}.</p>

				<title>Fixation of CO$_2$ in air: Synthesis and crystal structure of a $\mu_3$-CO$_3$-bridged tricopper(II) compound</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0111-0116</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A novel trinuclear copper(II) compound [&#123;(L$^3$)Cu(OClO$_3$)&#125;$_3$($\mu_3$-OCO$_2$)][ClO$_4$] has been synthesised using an N-tridentate symmetrical pyridylalkylamine ligand, N-methyl-N,N-\textit{bis}(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (L$^3$). The structure of the complex has been determined by X-ray crystallography; it is found to crystallise in the hexagonal space group $P6_3/_m$ with $a = 13 \cdot 936$(2), $b = 13 \cdot 936$(2), $c = 14 \cdot 895$(3) Å, $\alpha = \beta = 90$^\circ$, $\gamma = 120^\circ$. The complex possesses a $\bar{6}$ – symmetry axis passing through the carbon atom of the triply bridging carbonate ion, with the three symmetry related copper ions connected to one another through the oxygen atoms from the bridging carbonato group, giving an equilateral triangular array of copper centres. Each copper ion has distorted square pyramidal environment with the basal plane formed by three nitrogen atoms of the ligand L$^3$ and the oxygen atom of the bridging carbonato group. The apical position at each copper is provided by the weak oxygen coordination from the perchlorate ion.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, characterisation of few N-substituted 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives and their copper(II) complexes</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>A few 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives with phenyl ({\bf 1}), benzyl ({\bf 2}), 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl ethyl ({\bf 3}), 4-pyridyl ({\bf 4}), 2-hydroxy ethyl ({\bf 5}), 4-pyridylmethyl ({\bf 6}) groups attached to the nitrogen atom are synthesized and characterized. Cyclic voltammograms of all these compounds show one-electron reversible redox cycle ( $–1 \cdot 24$ V to $–1\cdot18$ V) due to formation of anion radicals. However, in the case of ({\bf 5}), quenching of this redox process occurs when polyhydroxy-aromatic compounds such as 1,3-dihydroxy benzene and 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene are added. Copper complexes, namely \textit{bis}-&#123;N-(4-pyridylmethyl)1,8-naphthalimide&#125;copper (II) perchlorate ({\bf 8}), \textit{bis}-&#123;N-(4-pyridylmethyl)1,8-naphthalimide&#125;copper (II) perchlorate ({\bf 9}) and \textit{bis}-&#123;N-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalimide&#125; copper (II) perchlorate ({\bf 10}) are synthesized and characterised. The complexes ({\bf 8}) and ({\bf 9}) show reversible redox couple of the ligand without any significant interaction with the redox active copper (II) centre.</p>

				<title>Effect of copper–sulphur bond on the DNA photo-cleavage activity of 2-(methylthio)ethylpyridine-2-carbaldimine copper(II) complexes</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The binding and photo-induced DNA cleavage activity of a binary complex [CuL$_2$](ClO$_4$)$_2$ ({\bf 1}) and the \textit{in situ} generated ternary complexes [CuLB](ClO$_4$)$_2$ from {\bf 1} (B: 1,10-phenanthroline, phen, {\bf 2}; dipyrido[3,2-$d$: 2',3'-$f$]quinoxaline, dpq, {\bf 3}) are studied, where L is a N$_2$S-donor tridentate Schiff base 2-(methylthio)ethylpyridine-2-carbaldimine. Complex {\bf 1}, structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction study, has six-coordinate meridional geometry showing CuN$_4$S$_2$ coordination. The Cu–N bond lengths are in the range of $1 \cdot 968$(3) to $2 \cdot 158$(4) Å. The Cu–S bond lengths of $2 \cdot 599$(2) and $2 \cdot 705$(2) Å are significantly long indicating weak covalent interaction between copper and sulphur atoms. The thiomethyl groups are \textit{cis} to each other giving S–Cu–S angle of 75$\cdot$82(5)$^\circ$. The Cu–N(pyridyl) bond distances are longer than the Cu–N(imine) bonds. The complexes are redox active and display a quasi-reversible cyclic voltammetric response assignable to the Cu(II)/Cu(I) couple near 0$\cdot$0 V vs SCE in DMF-Tris buffer (1 : 4 $v/v$) using 0$\cdot$1 M KCl as supporting electrolyte. Electronic spectra of the complexes show a $d–d$ band in the range 630 to 700 nm in DMF along with higher energy charge transfer bands. While complex {\bf 1} is a poor binder to DNA, the ternary complexes show good DNA binding propensity. The photo-nuclease activity of {\bf 1–3} is studied using UV and visible wavelengths. The DNA cleavage activity at 365 nm follows the order: {\bf 3} $&gt;$ {\bf 2} $&gt;$ {\bf 1}. The cleavage reaction involves the formation of singlet oxygen as the reactive species in a type-II process.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence-enhancement with different ionic inputs in a cryptand-based multi-receptor signalling system</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0145-0151</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two molecules of a laterally non-symmetric aza cryptand have been attached to 9,10-dimethylanthracene to obtain a multi-receptor fluorescent signalling system in the ``receptor–spacer–fluorophore– spacer–receptor” format. In the absence of a metal ion, weak fluorescence is observed upon excitation of the anthryl group owing to efficient photo-induced electron transfer (PET) of the lone pair of N attached to the anthryl group. However, when a metal salt is added, the lone pair is engaged, thus in blocking of the PET and leading to recovery of fluorescence to different extents depending upon the nature of the metal ion.</p>

					<p>Mixed-ligand complexes of the type [Ru(N-N)$_2$(dzdf)]Cl$_2$, where N–N is 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 9-diazo-4,5-diazafluorene (dzdf), have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, UV–Vis, IR and NMR spectroscopy.

				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence properties of meso-tetrafurylporphyrins with N$_4$, N$_3$S and N$_2$S$_2$ porphyrin cores are studied by both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques and compared with the corresponding meso-tetraarylporphyrins. The study shows that the replacement of six-membered aryl groups with five-membered furyl groups at meso-positions alter the fluorescence properties considerably, as reflected in the large red shifts and broadening of fluorescence bands with reduction in quantum yields and singlet excited-state lifetimes. However, zinc(II) derivatives of meso-tetrafurylporphyrin and mesotetraarylporphyrin did not show significant differences in their emission properties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reaction of N-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)pyrrole-2-aldimine (H$_2$L) with [M(PPh$_3$)$_3$Cl] (M = Rh, Ir) affords complexes of type [M(PPh$_3$)$_2$(L)Cl]. Structures of both complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In both complexes, the N-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)pyrrole-2-aldimine ligand is coordinated to the metal centre, via dissociation of the acidic protons, as a dianionic tridentate N,N,O-donor. The M(L)Cl fragment constitutes an equatorial plane with the metal at the centre and the two PPh3 ligands occupying axial positions. The complexes are diamagnetic (low-spin $d^6$, $S = 0$) and show intense MLCT transitions in the visible region. Cyclic voltammetry of the [M(PPh$_3$)$_2$(L)Cl] complexes shows reversible M(III)–M(IV) oxidation near $0\cdot 5$ V vs SCE and quasi-reversible ligand-centred oxidative response near 1$\cdot$0 V vs SCE.</p>

				<title>Mixed-ligand copper(II) complexes of dipicolylamine and 1,10-phenanthrolines: The role of diimines in the interaction of the complexes with DNA</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0179-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mixed-ligand copper(II) complexes of the type [Cu(dipica)(diimine)](ClO$_4$)$_2$, where dipica is di(2-picolyl)amine and diimine is 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (5,6-dmp), 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (2,9-dmp) or dipyridoquinoxaline (dpq), have been isolated and characterized by analytical and spectral methods. The copper(II) complexes exhibit a broad band in the visible region around 675 nm and axial EPR spectra in acetonitrile glass (77 K) with $g_{||}$ and $A_{||}$ values of $~2 \cdot 22$ and $185 \times 10^{–4}$ cm$^{–1}$ respectively, suggesting the presence of a square-based coordination geometry for the CuN$_5$ chromophore involving strong axial interaction. The interaction of the complexes with CT DNA has been studied using absorption, emission and circular dichroic spectral methods and viscosity measurements. Absorption spectral titrations reveal that the intrinsic DNA binding affinities are dependent upon the nature of the diimine ligand: dpq &gt; 5,6-dmp &gt; phen &gt; 2,9-dmp. This suggests the involvement of the diimine rather than the dipica `face’ of the complexes in DNA binding. An intercalative mode of DNA interaction, which involves the insertion of dpq and to a lesser extent the phen ring of the complexes in between the DNA base pairs, is proposed. However, interestingly, the 5,6-dmp complex is involved in hydrophobic interaction of the 5,6-dmp ring in the grooves of DNA. The large enhancement in the relative viscosity of DNA on binding to the dpq and 5,6-dmp complexes supports the proposed DNA binding modes. Further, remarkably, the 5,6-dmp complex is selective in exhibiting a positive-induced CD band on binding to DNA suggesting the transition of the B form of CT DNA to A-like conformation. The variation in relative emission intensities of DNA-bound ethidium bromide observed upon treatment with the complexes parallels the trend in DNA binding affinities.</p>

				<title>Iron(III) porphyrin-catalysed oxidation reactions by $m$-chloroperbenzoic acid: Nature of reactive intermediates</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0187-0191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of $m$-chloroperbenzoic ($m$-CPBA) acid with meso-\textit{tetrakis} (pentafluorophenyl) porphynatoiron(III) chloride (F$_{20}TPPF$_e$(III)Cl ) has been studied in dichloromethane and acetonitrile medium at $25 \pm 1^\circ$C. The reactive intermediates formed in this reaction have been quantitatively trapped by 2,4,6-tri $t$-butylphenol (TTBP) in both the solvents. It has been observed that the kinetic plots of the formation of TTBP$^\bigdot$ radical in dichloromethane are all multiexponential, supporting the formation of more than one reactive intermediate in this solvent. In acetonitrile solvent the formation of TTBP$^\bigdot$ radical was however observed to be distinctly single exponential. Different kinds of reactive intermediates are proposed in these two solvents.</p>

				<title>Porphyrin–anthraquinone dyads: Synthesis, spectroscopy and photochemistry</title>
				<feature>Recent Advances in Bio-inorganic Chemistry</feature>
				<page>0193-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Free-base (H$_2$L$^2$), copper(II) (CuL$^2$) and zinc(II) (ZnL$^2$) derivatives of a porphyrin–anthraquinone conjugate with an azomethine group separating the two photoactive subunits have been synthesized and characterized by mass (FAB), IR, UV–visible, 1H NMR and ESR spectroscopic techniques and also by cyclic and differential pulse voltammetric methods. Analysis of the data reveals that the spectral and electrochemical properties of the individual chromophoric entities are retained and that there is no specific $\pi$–$\pi$ interaction between the porphyrin and anthraquinone subunits. H$_2$L$^2$ and ZnL$^2$ are shown to exhibit substantial quenching (88–97%) of the porphyrin fluorescence compared to their corresponding monomeric analogues. An intramolecular electron-transfer mechanism is proposed for the substantial decrease in fluorescence in both derivatives. The fluorescence decays of porphyrin–anthraquinone conjugates are fit to 2/3 exponentials and indicate that multiple orientations of the porphyrin and anthraquinone groups contribute to the electron-transfer event. These results are in good agreement with steady-state fluorescence results. From the time-resolved fluorescence data, the electron-transfer rate constants are calculated, indicating $k_{\text{ET}}$ values in the range of $1\cdot 1 \times 10^9$ to $9 \cdot 9 \times  10^{10}$ s$^{–1}$ that are dependent upon the solvent.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0207-0218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Underpotential deposition (UPD) of metals is analysed from the perspective of phenomenological and statistical thermodynamic considerations; the parameters influencing the UPD shift have been quantitatively indicated using a general formalism. The manner in which the macroscopic properties pertaining to the depositing ions and solvent dipoles and the nature of the metallic substrate influence the UPD process are highlighted; earlier correlations of the UPD shift with the work function differences are rationalised. Anion-induced phase transitions which manifest as sharp peaks in experimental cyclic voltammograms are discussed using statistical thermodynamic models.</p>

					<p>Two new compounds, [(C$_4$N$_2$H$_{12}$)$_3$][P$_2$Mo$_5$O$_{23}$]$\cdot$H$_2$O, {\bf I}, and [(C$_3$N$_2$H$_{12}$)$_3$][P$_2$Mo$_5$O$_{23}$]$\cdot$4H$_2$O, {\bf II}, have been prepared employing hydrothermal methods in the presence of aliphatic organic amine molecules. Both the compounds possess the same polyoxoanion, pentamolybdatobisphosphate, (P$_2$Mo$_5$O$_{23}$)$^{6–}$. The anions consist of a ring of five MoO$_6$ distorted octahedra with four edge connections and one corner connection. The phosphate groups cap the pentamolybdate ring anion on either side. The anion is stabilized by strong hydrogen bonds involving the hydrogen atoms of the amine molecules and the oxygen atoms of the polyoxoanion and water molecules.

					<p>Densities ($\rho$) of glycine, L-alanine, and L-valine in aqueous solutions of MgCl$_2 \dot$6H$_2$O ($0 \cdot 1–0 \cdot 8$ mol kg$^{–1}$) have been measured at $288 \cdot 15$, and $308 \cdot 15$ K. Apparent molar volumes ($V_\phi$), and limiting partial molar volumes ($V^0_{\phi}$) of each amino acid have been calculated. These data were combined with the earlier reported $V^0_{\phi}$ values of glycine, L-alanine, and L-valine in aqueous MgCl$_2\cdot 6$H$_2$O solutions at $298 \cdot 15$ K in order to describe the temperature dependence behaviour of partial molar quantities. Group contributions to partial molar volumes have been determined for the amino acids. The trends of transfer volumes ($\Delta V^0_{\phi}$) have been interpreted in terms of solute–cosolute interactions on the basis of a cosphere overlap model. Pair and triplet interaction coefficients have also been calculated from transfer parameters.</p>

					<p>Viscosities and densities of sucrose in aqueous alkali metal halide solutions of different concentrations in the temperature range $293 \cdot 15$ to $313 \cdot 15$ K have been measured. Partial molar volumes at infinite dilution ($V_2^0$) of sucrose determined from apparent molar volume ($\phi_v$) have been utilized to estimate partial molar volumes of transfer ($V^0_{2,tr}$) for sucrose from water to alkali metal halide solutions. The viscosity data of alkali metal halides in purely aqueous solutions and in the presence of sucrose at different temperatures ($293\cdot 15$, $303 \cdot 15$ and $313 \cdot 5$ K) have been analysed by the Jones–Dole equation. The nature and magnitude of solute–solvent and solute–solute interactions have been discussed in terms of the values of limiting apparent molar volume ($\phi^0_v$), slope ($S_v$) and coefficients of the Jones–Dole equation. The structuremaking and structure-breaking capacities of alkali metal halides in pure aqueous solutions and in the presence of sucrose have been ascertained from temperature dependence of $\phi^0_v$.</p>

The role of selenocysteine moiety in natural mammalian enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), iodothyronine deiodinase (ID) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is highlighted and the effect of other amino acid residues located in close proximity to selenocysteine is described. It is evident from various studies that two amino acid residues, tryptophan and glutamine, appear in identical positions in all known members of the GPx family. According to the three-dimensional structure established for bovine GPx, these residues could constitute a catalytic triad in which the selenol group of the selenocysteine is both stabilized and activated by hydrogen bonding with the imino group of the tryptophan (Trp) residue and with the amido group of the glutamine (Gln) residue. The ID enzymes, on the other hand, do not possess any Trp or Gln residues in close proximity to selenium, but contain several histidine residues, which may play important roles in the catalysis. The TrxR enzymes also possess some basic histidines, but the most important amino acid residues are the cysteines which constitute the internal cofactor systems along with the catalytically active selenocysteine. The catalytic activity and substrate specificity of all three selenoenzymes are described. The reactivity of selenocysteine residues in selenoenzymes towards metal-based drugs such as goldthioglucose is also described.</p>

				<title>Electrochemical determination of hydrogen peroxide using $o$-dianisidine as substrate and hemoglobin as catalyst</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0317-0322</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new electrochemical method for the determination of microamounts of hydrogen peroxide utilizing $o$-dianisidine (ODA) as substrate and hemoglobin (Hb) as catalyst is described in this paper. Hb can be used as mimetic peroxidase and it can catalyse the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with the subsequent oxidation of ODA. The oxidative reaction product is an azo compound, which is an electroactive substance and has a sensitive second-order derivative polarographic reductive peak at the potential of $–0 \cdot 58$ V (vs. SCE) in pH $8\cdot0$ Britton–Robinson (B–R) buffer solution. The conditions of Hb-catalytic reaction and polarographic detection of the reaction product were carefully studied. By using this polarographic peak and under optimal conditions, the calibration curve for the H$_2$O$_2$ was constructed in the linear range of $2 \cdot 0 \times 10$^{–7} \tilde 1 \cdot 0  \times 10^{–4}$ mol/l with the detection limit of $5 \cdot 0 \times 10^{–8}$ mol/l. This method can also be used to the determination of Hb content in the range of $2 \cdot 0  \times 10^{–9} \tilde 3 \cdot 0  \times 10^{–7}$ mol/l with a detection limit of $1 \cdot 0 \times 10^{–9}$ mol/l. The proposed method was further applied to the determination of the content of H$_2$O$_2$ in fresh rainwater with satisfactory results. The catalytic reaction mechanism and the electrode reductive process of the reaction product were carefully studied.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of glycine by iron(III)–1,10-phenanthroline complex has been studied in perchloric acid medium. The reaction is first order with respect to iron(III) and glycine. An increase in (phenanthroline) increases the rate, while increase in [H$^+$] decreases the rate. Hence it can be inferred that the reactive species of the substrate is the zwitterionic form and that of the oxidant is [Fe(phen)$_2$(H$_2$O)$_2$]$^{3+}$. The proposed mechanism leads to the rate law as elucidated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chloramphenicol (CAP) is an antibiotic drug having a wide spectrum of activity. The kinetics of oxidation of chloramphenicol by 1-chlorobenzotriazole (CBT) in HClO$_4$ medium over the temperature range 293–323 K has been investigated. The reaction exhibits first-order kinetics with respect to [CBT]$_o$ and zero-order with respect to [CAP]$_o$. The fractional-order dependence of rate on [H$^+$] suggests complex formation between CBT and H$^+$. It fails to induce polymerization of acrylonitrile under the experimental conditions employed. Activation parameters are evaluated. The observed solvent isotope effect indicates the absence of hydride transfer during oxidation. Effects of dielectric constant and ionic strength of the medium on the reaction rate have been studied. Oxidation products are identified. A suitable reaction scheme is proposed and an appropriate rate law is deduced to account for the observed kinetic data.</p>

					<p>A comparative study of the electro-oxidation of ethanol and 2-propanol was carried out on carbon-supported platinum particles. Cyclic voltammetry, steady state polarisation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to investigate the oxidation reactions. A difference in the mechanistic behaviour of the oxidation of ethanol and 2-propanol on Pt was observed, thereby highlighting the fact that the molecular structure of the alcohol has great influence on its electroreactivity. The study emphasizes the fact that 2-propanol is a promising fuel candidate for a direct alcohol fuel cell.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of protection of adenosine from sulphate radical anion and repair of adenosine radicals by caffeic acid in aqueous solution</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0345-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The photooxidation of adenosine in presence of peroxydisulphate (PDS) has been studied by spectrophotometrically measuring the absorbance of adenosine at 260 nm. The rates of oxidation of adenosine by sulphate radical anion have been determined in the presence of different concentrations of caffeic acid. Increase in [caffeic acid] is found to decrease the rate of oxidation of adenosine suggesting that caffeic acid acts as an efficient scavenger of $SO_4^{\bitdot–}$ and protects adenosine from it. Sulphate radical anion competes for adenosine as well as for caffeic acid. The quantum yields of photooxidation of adenosine have been calculated from the rates of oxidation of adenosine and the light intensity absorbed by PDS at 254 nm, the wavelength at which PDS is activated to sulphate radical anion. From the results of experimentally determined quantum yields ($\phi_{\text{exptl}}$) and the quantum yields calculated ($\phi_{\text{cal}}$) assuming caffeic acid acting only as a scavenger of $SO_4^{\bigdot–}$ show that $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values are lower than $\phi_{\text{cal}}$ values. The $f'$ values, which are experimentally found quantum yield values at each caffeic acid concentration and corrected for $SO_4^{\bigdot–}$ scavenging by caffeic acid, are also found to be greater than $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values. These observations suggest that the transient adenosine radicals are repaired by caffeic acid in addition to scavenging of sulphate radical anions.</p>

The data have been evaluated using the Jones–Dole equation and the obtained parameters have been interpreted in terms of solute–solute and solute–solvent interactions. The activation parameters of viscous flow have been obtained which depicts the mechanism of viscous flow.

				<title>DFT reactivity indices in confined many-electron atoms</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0379-0386</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The density functional descriptors of chemical reactivity given by electronegativity, global hardness and softness are reported for a representative set of spherically confined atoms of IA, IIA, VA and VIIIA series in the periodic table. The atomic electrons are confined within the impenetrable spherical cavity defined by a given radius of confinement satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition such that the electron density vanishes at the radius of confinement. With this boundary condition the non-relativistic spin-polarized Kohn–Sham equations were solved. The electronegativity in a confined atom is found to decrease as the radius of confinement is reduced suggesting that relative to the free state the atom loses its capacity to attract electrons under confined conditions. While the global hardness of a confined atom increases as the radius of confinement decreases, due to the accompanying orbital energy level crossing, it does not increase infinitely. At a certain confinement radius, the atomic global hardness is even reduced due to such crossover. General trends of the atomic softness parameter under spherically confined conditions are reported and discussed.</p>

					<p>Both electron propagator theory and density-functional theory provide conceptually useful information about chemical reactivity and, most especially, charge transfer. This paper elucidates thequalitative and quantitative links between the two theories, with emphasis on how the reactivity indicators of conceptual density-functional theory can be derived from electron propagator theory. Electron propagator theory could be used to compute reactivity indices with high accuracy at reasonable computational cost.</p>

				<title>A density functional theory-based chemical potential equalisation approach to molecular polarizability</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0401-0409</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electron density changes in molecular systems in the presence of external electric fields are modeled for simplicity in terms of the induced charges and dipole moments at the individual atomic sites. A chemical potential equalisation scheme is proposed for the calculation of these quantities and hence the dipole polarizability within the framework of density functional theory based linear response theory. The resulting polarizability is expressed in terms of the contributions from individual atoms in the molecule. A few illustrative numerical calculations are shown to predict the molecular polarizabilities in good agreement with available results. The usefulness of the approach to the calculation of intermolecular interaction needed for computer simulation is highlighted.</p>

				<title>Relation between the Fukui function and the Coulomb hole</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0411-0418</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By using a coarse-grain representation of the molecular electronic density, we demonstrate that the value of the condensed Fukui function at an atomic site is directly related to the polarization charge (Coulomb hole) induced by a test electron removed (or added) from (at) the atom. The link between the formation of an electron-hole pair and the condensed Fukui function provides insights on the possible negativity of the Fukui function which is interpreted in terms of two phenomena: overscreening and overstrengthening.</p>

				<title>Condensation of the highest occupied molecular orbital within the electron localization function domains</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0419-0424</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Use of regions of space defined by topological analysis of electron localization function (ELF) as reactivity descriptors is explored. By starting from the fact that the ELF presents high values in the regions where it is most probable to find an electron pair and that the square of the HOMO is a good measure of the reactivity of a molecule, it is proposed that the integration of the square of the HOMO over the volumes defined by the ELF should be a local index for predicting the most nucleophilic site of a molecule. We present here some computational results on simple systems in order to get some insights about this possibility.</p>

					<p>The concept of the ensemble Kohn–Sham hardness is introduced. It is shown that the first excitation energy can be given by the Kohn–Sham hardness (i.e. the energy difference of the ground-state lowest unoccupied and highest occupied levels) plus an extra term coming from the partial derivative of the ensemble exchange-correlation energy with respect to the weighting factor w in the limit $w  \rightarrow 0$. It is proposed that the first excitation energy can be used as a reactivity index instead of the hardness.</p>

				<title>Electron localization functions and local measures of the covariance</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0441-0454</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electron localization measure proposed by Becke and Edgecombe is shown to be related to the covariance of the electron pair distribution. Just as with the electron localization function, the local covariance does not seem to be, in and of itself, a useful quantity for elucidating shell structure. A function of the local covariance, however, is useful for this purpose. A different function, based on the hyperbolic tangent, is proposed to elucidate the shell structure encapsulated by the local covariance; this function also seems to work better for the electron localization measure of Becke and Edgecombe. In addition, we propose a different measure for the electron localization that incorporates both the electron localization measure of Becke and Edgecombe and the Laplacian of the electron density; preliminary indications are that this measure is especially good at elucidating the shell structure in valence regions. Methods for evaluating electron localization functions directly from the electron density, without recourse to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, are discussed.</p>

				<title>Geometric interpretation of density displacements and charge sensitivities</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0455-0466</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ``geometric” interpretation of the electronic density displacements in the Hilbert space is given and the associated projection-operator partitioning of the hardness and softness operators (kernels) is developed. The eigenvectors |&#198;$\rangle  = \{|\alpha \rangle \}$ of the hardness operator define the complete (identity) projector $ \hat{P} = \sum_\alpha | \alpha \rangle \langle \alpha = 1$ for general density displacements, including the \textit{charge-transfer} (CT) component, while the eigenvectors $| \boldmath{i} \rangle = \{ | i\rangle\}$ of the linear response operator determine the \textit{polarizational} $P$-projector, $\hat{P}_P = \sum_i | i \rangle\langle i|$. Their difference thus defines the complementary CT-projector: $\hat{P}_{CT} = 1 - \hat{P}_P$. The complete vector space for density displacements can be also spanned by supplementing the $P$-modes with the homogeneous CT-mode. These subspaces separate the integral (normalization) and local aspects of density shifts in molecular systems.</p>

				<title>The reaction force: Three key points along an intrinsic reaction coordinate</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0467-0472</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concept of the reaction force is presented and discussed in detail. For typical processes with energy barriers, it has a universal form which defines three key points along an intrinsic reaction coordinate: the force minimum, zero and maximum. We suggest that the resulting four zones be interpreted as involving preparation of reactants in the first, transition to products in the second and third, and relaxation in the fourth. This general picture is supported by the distinctive patterns of the variations in relevant electronic properties. Two important points that are brought out by the reaction force are that (a) the traditional activation energy comprises two separate contributions, and (b) the transition state corresponds to a balance between the driving and the retarding forces.</p>

					<p>Dynamic behaviors of chemical concepts in density functional theory such as frontier orbitals (HOMO/LUMO), chemical potential, hardness, and electrophilicity index have been investigated in this work in the context of Bohn-Oppenheimer quantum molecular dynamics in association with molecular conformation changes. Exemplary molecular systems like CH$^+_5$ , Cl$^–$ (H$_2$O)$_{30}$ and Ca$^{2+}$ (H$_2$O)$_{15}$ are studied at 300 K in the gas phase, demonstrating that HOMO is more dynamic than LUMO, chemical potential and hardness often fluctuate concurrently. It is argued that DFT concepts and indices may serve as a good framework to understand molecular conformation changes as well as other dynamic phenomena.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The third term in the Taylor expansion of the total energy functional around the number of electrons $N$ is evaluated as the second-order derivative of orbital Kohn–Sham energies with respect to orbital occupancy. Present approach is an extension of an efficient algorithm to compute densityfunctional based orbital reactivity indices. Various energy derivatives used to approximate orbital reactivity indices are defined within the space spanned by the orbital occupation numbers and the Kohn–Sham one-electron energies. The third-order energy functional derivative has to be considered for singular hardness tensor ([$\eta$]). On the contrary, this term has negligible influence on the reactivity index values for atomic or molecular systems with positively defined hardness tensors. In this context, stability of a system in equilibrium state estimated through the eigenvalues of [h] is discussed. Numerical illustration of the Kohn–Sham energy functional derivatives in orbital resolution up to the third order is shown for benchmark molecules such as H$_2$O, H$_2$S, and OH$^–$.</p>

The most frequently explored are global, reactant, atoms-in-molecule, orbital, and local resolutions. In this paper we have considered reactant resolution, i.e., the mutually polarized reactants before the charge-transfer among them.

				<abstract>
					<p>Using the constrained search and Legendre-transform formalisms, one can derive ``generalized” density-functional theories, in which the fundamental variable is either the electron pair density or the second-order reduced density matrix. In both approaches, the $N$-representability problem is solved by the functional, and the variational principle is with respect to all pair densities (density matrices) that are nonnegative and appropriately normalized. The Legendre-transform formulation provides a lower bound on the constrained-search functional. Noting that experience in density-functional and density-matrix theories suggests that it is easier to approximate functionals than it is to approximate the set of $N$-representable densities sheds some light on the significance of this work.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The structure and coordination chemistry of boron porphyrin complexes B$_2$OX$_2$ (T$_p$YPP) (X = OH, F; Y = Cl, CH$_3$) in connection with its chemical reactivity are analyzed at \textit{ab initio} density functional theory B3LYP/6-31G$^{\ast}$ and restricted Hartree–Fock RHF/6-31G$^{\ast}$ levels of theory. Global reactivity and local selectivity descriptors are used as adequate tools to analyze the isomerism effect ($Z$ or $E$ isomer) and the substitution effect (X: in axial ligand; or Y: in porphyrin ligand). In all the cases, we find that the $E$ conformation is the most stable one, in agreement with X-ray results, and that a principle of maximum hardness in the isomerism analysis is fullfilled. In the substitution analysis, we find that the three global reactivity indexes ($\eta$, $\omega$, $\chi$) and the two local reactivity indexes ($f_k$, electrostatic potential) used in this paper predict the same trend when an electron-withdrawing substituent is replaced by an electron donor. Finally, we show that substitution in the porphyrin ligand is slightly more significant than that in the axial ligand.</p>

				<title>Chemical reactivity of hypervalent silicon compounds: The local hard and soft acids and bases principle viewpoint</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0525-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The silicon atom may increase its coordination number to values greater than four, to form pentacoordinated compounds. It has been observed experimentally that, in general, pentacoordinated compounds show greater reactivity than tetracoordinated compounds. In this work, density functional theory is used to calculate the global softness and the condensed softness of the silicon atom for SiH$_n$F$_{4–n}$ and SiH$_n$F$^{1–}_{5–n}$. The values obtained show that the global and condensed softness are greater in the pentacoordinated compounds than in the tetracoordinated compounds, a result that explains the enhanced reactivity. If the results are analysed through a local version of the hard and soft acids and bases principle, it is possible to suggest that in nucleophilic substitution reactions, soft nucleophiles preferably react with SiH$_n$F$^{1–}_{5–n}$, and hard nucleophiles with SiH$_n$F$_{4–n}$.</p>

				<title>Application of localized reactivity index in combination with periodic DFT calculation to rationalize the swelling mechanism of clay type inorganic material</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0533-0539</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Clays are layered alumino-silicates. Clays swell and expand in aqueous solution. This property governs the usage of these materials in synthesis of nano-composites and is a source of many of its catalytic applications. We used both localized and periodic calculations within the realm of density functional theory (DFT) on a series of monovalent (Li$^+$, Na$^+$, K$^+$, Rb$^+$, Cs$^+$), and divalent (Mg$^{2+}$, Ca$^{2+}$, Sr$^{2+}$, Ba$^{2+}$) cations, to monitor their effect on the swelling of clays. The activity order obtained for the exchangeable cations among all the monovalent and divalent series studied is: Mg$^{2+} &gt; Ca$^{2+}$ &gt; Sr$^{2+}$ &gt; Ba$^{2+}$ &gt; Cs$^{+}$ &gt; Rb$^+$ &gt; Na$^+$ &gt; Li$^+$ &gt; K$^+$. We have studied two types of clays, montmorillonite and beidellite, with different surface structures and with/without water using periodic calculations. We have calculated the layer spacing at the first, second and third hydration shells of exchangeable cation, to compare with the experimental $d$-spacing values to correlate with humidity. A novel quantitative scale is proposed in terms of the intermolecular relative nucleophilicity of the active cation sites in their hydrated state through Fukui functions using hard–soft acid base (HSAB) principle. Finally, a swelling mechanism is proposed. This is a unique study where a combination of periodic and localized calculations has been performed to validate the capability of reactivity index calculations in material designing.</p>

				<title>A philicity based analysis of adsorption of small molecules in zeolites</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>00-00</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Adsorption of small molecules like CH$_4$, CO and NH$_3$ into the acid sites of zeolites is analysed as an interaction between an electrophile and a nucleophile. Global reactivity descriptors like softness and electrophilicity, and local reactivity descriptors like the Fukui function, local softness and local philicity are calculated within density functional as well as Hartree–Fock frameworks using both Mulliken and Hirshfeld population analysis schemes. The HSAB principle and the best electrophilenucleophile combination suggest that the reaction between the NH$_3$ and Brönsted acid site of the zeolite is the strongest. Interaction between the zeolite and a small probe molecule takes place through the most electrophilic atom of one with the most nucleophilic atom of the other. This result is in conformity with those provided by the frontier orbital theory and the local HSAB principle.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In earlier work, the present authors have shown that hardness profiles are less dependent on the level of calculation than energy profiles for potential energy surfaces (PESs) having pathological behaviors. At variance with energy profiles, hardness profiles always show the correct number of stationary points. This characteristic has been used to indicate the existence of spurious stationary points on the PESs. In the present work, we apply this methodology to the hydrogen fluoride dimer, a classical difficult case for the density functional theory methods.</p>

				<title>Performance of density functional theory methods to describe intramolecular hydrogen shifts</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0555-0560</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The performance of three exchange and correlation density functionals, LDA, BLYP and B3LYP, with four basis sets is tested in three intramolecular hydrogen shift reactions. The best reaction and activation energies come from the hybrid functional B3LYP with triple-$\zeta$ basis sets, when they are compared with high-level post-Hartree–Fock results from the literature. For a fixed molecular geometry, the electrophilic Fukui function is computed from a finite difference approximation. Fukui function shows a small dependence with both the exchange and correlation functional and the basis set. Evolution of the Fukui function along the reaction path describes important changes in the basic sites of the corresponding molecules. These results are in agreement with the chemical behavior of those species.</p>

				<title>Regioselectivity in the [$2 + 2$] cyclo-addition reaction of triplet carbonyl compounds to substituted alkenes (Paterno–Büchi reaction): A spin-polarized conceptual DFT approach</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0561-0571</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Regioselectivity of the photochemical [$2 + 2$] cyclo-addition of triplet carbonyl compounds with a series of ground state electron-rich and electron-poor alkenes, the Paterno–Büchi reaction, is studied. Activation barriers for the first step of the triplet reaction are computed in the case of the O-attack. Next, the observed regioselectivity is explained using a series of DFT-based reactivity indices. In the first step, we use the local softness and the local HSAB principle within a softness matching approach, and explain the relative activation barriers of the addition step. In the final step, the regioselectivity is assessed within the framework of spin-polarized conceptual density functional theory, considering response functions of the system's external potential $v$, number of electrons $N$ and spin number $N_s$, being the difference between the number of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ electrons in the spin-polarized system. Although the concept of local spin philicity, introduced recently within this theory, appears less suited to predict the regioselectivity in this reaction, the correct regioselectivity emerges from considering an interaction between the largest values of the generalized Fukui functions $f_{ss}$ on both interacting molecules.</p>

				<title>Bottlenecks in the prediction of regioselectivity of [$4 + 2$] cycloaddition reactions: An assessment of reactivity descriptors</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0573-0582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>B3LYP/6-31G($d$) calculations were performed to obtain all the transition states and products for the 128 distinct reaction channels of Diels–Alder reactions by taking all possible combinations from a series of dienes (1N-a, 1N-b, 2N, 1P-a, 1P-b, 2P, 1O, 1S) and dienophiles (NE, PE, OE, SE, AE, OHE, MeE, CNE). The predictive ability of the values to gauge the regioselectivity of the putative [$4 + 2$] cycloaddition reactions is analysed. No correlation is obtained between the reaction energies and activation energies. The extent of asynchronicity is measured based on the bond order analysis. DFT-based descriptors such as the local softness ($s^+_k$ and $s_k^–$), Fukui function indices ($f^+_k$ and $f_k^–$), global electrophilicity index ($\omega$) and local electrophilicity index ($\omega_w$) were found to be better than the conventional FMO predictions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>It has been shown recently, how the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and vibrational modes is reflected in the properties of molecules. The necessary derivatives have been analyzed and their thermodynamic relations were demonstrated. This present work is focused on the analysis of a molecular system, under the influence of C–PCM induced solvent effect. The analysis is based on reactivity indices derived from DFT. The shift of frequency for diatomic molecules has been obtained. It has been identified as chemical force effect. The role of nuclear reactivity indices has been emphasized. This concept has been extended to obtain regional chemical potential values within C–PCM model for polyatomic molecules</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we have introduced the atomic descriptors $s(f)_k$ to determine the local reactive sites of the molecular systems during electrophilic, nucleophilic and radical attacks. The condensed Fukui function and the newly introduced condensed atomic descriptor have been calculated for six different systems, namely glycine, alanine, aniline, BH$_2$Cl, \textit{trans}-FC(O)OF and $m$-anisidine. The individual atomic charges (gross charge) calculated by the MPA scheme have been used to calculate the condensed Fukui functions ($f_k$) and the newly derived condensed atomic descriptors ($sf$)$^{\alpha}_k$ at B1-DZP level of theory. We carried out the calculation using the ``stockholders” charge partitioning technique (i.e., Hirshfeld population scheme). The newly derived quantity gives the same reactive sites as the condensed Fukui functions, and the complexities associated with the negative Fukui functions are removed.</p>

				<title>A conceptual DFT approach towards analysing toxicity</title>
				<feature>Special Issue on Chemical Reactivity</feature>
				<page>0599-0612</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The applicability of DFT-based descriptors for the development of toxicological structure–
activity relationships is assessed. Emphasis in the present study is on the quality of DFT-based descriptors
for the development of toxicological QSARs and, more specifically, on the potential of the electrophilicity
concept in predicting toxicity of benzidine derivatives and the series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons
(PAH) expressed in terms of their biological activity data (pIC50). First, two benzidine derivatives, which
act as electron-donating agents in their interactions with biomolecules are considered. Overall toxicity in
general and the most probable site of reactivity in particular are effectively described by the global and
local electrophilicity parameters respectively. Interaction of two benzidine derivatives with nucleic acid
(NA) bases/selected base pairs is determined using Parr’s charge transfer formula. The experimental biological
activity data (pIC50) for the family of PAH, namely polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), polyhalogenated
dibenzo-p-dioxins (PHDD) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are taken as dependent
variables and the HF energy (E), along with DFT-based global and local descriptors, viz., electrophilicity
index (w) and local electrophilic power (w+) respectively are taken as independent variables. Fairly good
correlation is obtained showing the significance of the selected descriptors in the QSAR on toxins that act
as electron acceptors in the presence of biomolecules. Effects of population analysis schemes in the calculation
of Fukui functions as well as that of solvation are probed. Similarly, some electron-donor aliphatic
amines are studied in the present work. We see that global and local electrophilicities along with
the HF energy are adequate in explaining the toxicity of several substances</p>
