				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>After a brief introduction to neutrino mass via the see-saw model I discuss neutrinomixing and oscillation, first in vacuum and then its matter enhancement. Then the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation data are briefly reviewed. Finally I discuss the problem of reconciling hierarchical neutrino masses with at least one large mixing, as implied by these data. A minimal see-saw model for reconciling the two is discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A brief introduction to the phenomena of vacuum neutrino oscillations and resonant flavour conversion is presented with a heavy pedagogic leaning. Variants of these ideas, e.g., neutrino helicity flip in a magnetic field, violation of the equivalence principle, etc. are outlined. A few vexing issues pertaining to the quantum mechanics of neutrino oscillations are discussed. Expectations from some of the future experiments are summarized.</p>

				<page>0047-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Neutrino oscillations in matter can exhibit a specific resonance enhancement - parametric resonance, which is different from the MSW resonance. Oscillations of atmospheric and solar neutrinos inside the earth can undergo parametric enhancement when neutrino trajectories cross the core of the earth. In this paper we review the parametric resonance of neutrino oscillations in matter. In particular, physical interpretation of the effect and the prospects of its experimental observation in oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos in the earth are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Majorana masses of the neutrino implies lepton number violation and is intimately related to the lepton asymmetry of the universe, which gets related to the baryon asymmetry of the universe in the presence of the sphalerons during the electroweak phase transition. Assuming that the baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated before the electroweak phase transition, it is possible to discriminate different classes of models of neutrino masses. While see-saw mechanism and the triplet Higgs mechanism are preferred, the Zee-type radiative models and theR-parity breaking models requires additional inputs to generate baryon asymmetry of the universe during the electroweak phase transition.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Motivated by the recent super-Kamiokande results on atmospheric neutrinos, we incorporate massive neutrinos, with large angle oscillation between the second and third generations, in a theory with $R$-parity violating supersymmetry. The general features of such a theory are brieﬂy reviewed. We emphasize its testability through the observation of comparable numbers of muons and taus, produced together with the $W$-boson, in decays of the lightest neutralino. A distinctly measurable decay gap is anotherremarkable feature of such a scenario.</p>

					<p>We propose several new variables, insensitive to the absolute ﬂux of the incident solar or supernova neutrino beam, which probe the shape of the observed spectrum at super-Kamiokande and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiments and can sensitively signal neutrino oscillations. One class of such variables involve moments of the distributions recorded at the two facilities while another variable, speciﬁc to SNO, utilises the integrated charged and neutral current signals. The utility of these variables in the context of supernova neutrinos both from the collapse epoch and the post-bounce era is also discussed.</p>

				<page>0203-0214</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the main features of the ﬁeld-theoretical approach to neutrino oscillations where one combines neutrino production and detection processes in a single Feynman graph. The ‘oscillating neutrinos’ are represented by inner lines of this graph and appear in the calculation of the cross section of the total process as propagators of the neutrino mass eigenﬁelds. We show that this ﬁeld-theoretical approach leads to a transparent treatment of neutrino oscillations without ambiguities and provides the correct answer in cases where the standard approach fails.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report a generalization of our earlier formalism [Pramana, 54, 663 (1998)] to obtain exact solutions of Einstein–Maxwell's equations for static spheres ﬁlled with a charged ﬂuid having anisotropic pressure and of null conductivity. Deﬁning new variables: $\omega = (4\pi/3)(\rho+\epsilon)r^{2}$, $u=4\pi \xi r^{2}$, $v_{r}=4\pi p_{r}r^{2}$, $v_{\perp}=4\pi p_{\perp}r^{2}[\rho,\xi(=-(1/2)F_{14}F^{14})$, $p_{r}$, $p_{\perp}$ being respectively the energy densities of matter and electrostatic ﬁelds, radial and transverse ﬂuid pressures whereas $\epsilon$ denotes the eigenvalue of the conformal Weyl tensor and interpreted as the energy density of the free gravitational ﬁeld], we have recast Einstein's ﬁeld equations into a form easy to integrate. Since the system is underdetermined we make the following assumptions to solve the ﬁeld equations (i) $u=v_{r}=(a^{2}/2\kappa)r^{n+2}$, $v_{\perp}=k_{1}v_{r}$, $w=k_{2}v_{r}$; $a^{2}$, $n(>0)$, $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$ being constants with $\kappa=((k_{1}+2)/3+k_{2})$ and (ii) $w+u=(b^{2}/2)r^{n+2}$, $u=v_{r}$, $v_{\perp}-v_{r}=k$, with $b$ and $k$ as constants. In both cases the ﬁeld equations are integrated completely. The ﬁrst solution is regular in the metric as well as physical variables for all values of $n>0$. Even though the second solution contains terms like $k/r^2$ since $Q(0) = 0$ it is argued that the pressure anisotropy, caused by the electric ﬂux near the centre, can be made to vanish reducing it to the generalized Cooperstock–de la Cruz solution given in [14]. The interior solutions are shown to match with the exterior Reissner–Nordstrom solution over a ﬁxed boundary.</p>

				<title>Renormalization of seesaw neutrino masses in the standard model with two-Higgs doublets</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0235-0246</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the theoretical ambiguities inherent in the seesaw mechanism, we derive the new analytic expressions for both quadratic and linear seesaw formulae for neutrino masses at low energies, with either up-type quark masses or charged lepton masses. This is possible through full radiative corrections arising out of the renormalizations of the Yukawa couplings, the coefﬁcients of the neutrino-mass-operator in the standard model with two-Higgs doublets, and also the QCD–QED rescaling factors below the top-quark mass scale, at one-loop level. We also investigate numerically the uniﬁcation of top-$b$-$\tau$ Yukawa couplings at the scale $M_{I}=0.59\times 10^{8}$GeV for a ﬁxed value of $\tan \beta=58.77$, and then evaluate the seesaw neutrino masses which are too large in magnitude to be compatible with the presently available solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation data. However, if we consider a higher but arbitrary value of $M_{I}=0.59\times 10^{11}$GeV, the predictions from linear seesaw formulae with charged lepton masses, can accommodate simultaneousely both solar atmospheric neutrino oscillation data.</p>

					<p>The suitability of using the angular peak shape of the coherent backscattered light for estimating the light transport parameters of biological media has been investigated. Milk and methylene blue doped milk were used as tissue phantoms for the measurements carried out with a He–Ne laser (632.8 nm). Results indicate that while the technique accurately estimates the transport length, it can determine the absorption coefﬁcient only when the absorption is moderately high $(\alpha > 1{\rm \ cm}^{-1})$ for the long transport lengths typical of tissues. Further, the possibility of determining the anisotropy factor by estimating the single scattering contribution to the diffuse background is examined.</p>

				<title>Correlation between deformation bleaching and mechanoluminescence in coloured alkali halide crystals</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0287-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper reports the correlation between deformation bleaching of coloration and mechanoluminescence (ML) in coloured alkali halide crystals. When the $F$-centre electrons captured by moving dislocations are picked up by holes, deep traps and other compatible traps, then deformation bleaching occurs. At the same time, radiative recombination of dislocation captured electrons with the holes gives rise to the mechanoluminescence. Expressions are derived for the strain dependence of the density of colour centres in deformed crystals and also for the number of colour centres bleached. So far as strain, temperature, density of colour centres, $E_{a}$ and volume dependence are concerned, there exists a correlation between the deformation bleaching and ML in coloured alkali halide crystals. From the strain dependence of the density of colour centres in deformed crystals, the value of coefﬁcient of deformation bleaching $D$ is determined and it is found to be 1.93 and 2.00 for KCl and KBr crystals, respectively. The value of $(D + \mathcal{X})$ is determined from the strain dependence of the ML intensity and it is found to be 2.6 and 3.7 for KCl and KBr crystals, respectively. This gives the value of coefﬁcient of deformation generated compatible traps $\mathcal{X}$ to be 0.67 and 1.7 for KCl and KBr crystals, respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of substitution of vanadium in Bi$_{1.6}$Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_{3}O$_{\delta}$ ceramic at Bi and Cu sites has been investigated for the resistivity, a.c. susceptibility, XRD and a.c. magnetization studies. Enhancement in $T_{c}$ for the smaller concentrations of V at either of the two sites was observed which followed an expected lattice distortion and decrease in $T_{c}$ for higher V concentrations. V plays a role of substituting element more than just a sintering agent as reﬂected in the more rapid decrease in $T_{c}$ at Cu-site and further in the magnetization values that are higher compared to the values at the Bisite. It indicates higher magnetization scattering at the Cu site. The results were explained keeping in mind the liquid phase mechanism behind the formation of the 2223 phase and the possibility of magnetic scattering.</p>

				<title>A simpler and elegant algorithm for computing fractal dimension in higher dimensional state space</title>
				<feature>Rapid Communication</feature>
				<page>0331-0336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chaotic systems are now frequently encountered in almost all branches of sciences. Dimension of such systems provides an important measure for easy characterization of dynamics of the systems. Conventional algorithms for computing dimension of such systems in higher dimensional state space face an unavoidable problem of enormous storage requirement. Here we present an algorithm, which uses a simple but very powerful technique and faces no problem in computing dimension in higher dimensional state space. The unique indexing technique of hypercubes, used in this algorithm, provides a clever means to drastically reduce the requirement of storage. It is shown that theoretically this algorithm faces no problem in computing capacity dimension in any dimension of the embedding state space as far as the actual dimension of the attractor is ﬁnite. Unlike the existing algorithms, memory requirement offered by this algorithm depends only on the actual dimension of the attractor and has no explicit dependence on the number of data points considered.</p>

					<p>An exact solution is obtained for coupled dilaton and electromagnetic ﬁeld in a cylindrically symmetric spacetime where an axial magnetic ﬁeld as well as a radial electric ﬁeld both are present. Depending on the choice of the arbitrary constants our solution reduces either to dilatonic gravity with pure electric ﬁeld or to that with pure magnetic ﬁeld. In the ﬁrst case we have a curvature singularity at a ﬁnite distance from the axis indicating the existence of the boundary of a charged cylinder which may represent the source of the electric ﬁeld. For the second case we have a singularity on the axis. When the dilaton ﬁeld is absent the electromagnetic ﬁeld disappears in both the cases. Whereas the contrary is not true. It is further shown that light rays except for those proceeding in the radial direction are either trapped or escape to inﬁnity depending on the magnitudes of certain constant parameters as well as on the nature of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Nature of circular geodesics is also studied in the presence of dilaton ﬁeld in the cylindrically symmetric spacetime.</p>

				<page>0347-0354</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Clover detector has been used as a Compton polarimeter to measure the linear polarization of $\gamma$-rays produced in heavy ion fusion reaction. The polarization sensitivity of the clover detector has been measured over $\gamma$-ray energies ranging from 386 to 1368 keV. The E1 multipolarity of the 1117 keV transition in $^{99}$Rh has been established using this polarimeter. This has resulted in the assignment of negative parity to the band head at 3710 keV in $^{99}$Rh.</p>

					<p>Excitation functions for evaporation residues of the system $^{16}{\rm O} + $^{165}{\rm Ho}$ have been measured up to 100 MeV. Recoil range distribution of long lived reaction products were measured at $^{16}{\rm O}$ beam energy of 100 MeV. Detailed Monte Carlo simulation of recoil range distributions of products were performed with the help of PACE2 code, in order to extract the contributions of incomplete fusion in the individual channels. The results clearly show the incomplete fusion contributions in the tantalum and thulium products. This is conﬁrmed by the predictions of breakup fusion model of the incomplete fusion.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Transition amplitudes and transition probabilities for the two-photon $1s-2s$ transition in the hydrogen atom and $1^{1]s-2^{1}s$ transition in helium atom have been calculated using a partialclosure approach. The dominant term is calculated exactly and the remaining sum over intermediate states is calculated using a mean excitation energy. Our value of the transition amplitudes agree within 2% with the exact results for the hydrogen case. Our value of the transition probability for hydrogen is 8.50 $s^{-1}$ which is in good accord with its known value 8.226 s$^{-1}$. For helium, the photon energy distribution of the metastable $2^{1}s$ state is in good agreement with the accurate values. The corresponding transition probability is 53.7 s$^{-1}$ which is in good agreement with the accurate value 51.3 s$^{-1}$.</p>

					<p>We present a numerical investigation of quantum mechanical tunneling process in a double well potential with ﬂuctuating barrier. The tunneling probability and rate are calculated for two cases in which (i) the height of the barrier is undergoing harmonic oscillation with frequency $\omega$ and (ii) the height of the barrier is undergoing random ﬂuctuation with frequency $\omega$. It is observed that in both cases, the quantum mechanical tunneling probability and rate exhibit a maximum as a function of the ﬂuctuation frequency. The optimal frequency i.e. the frequency at which rate exhibits a maximum shows a strong isotopic mass effect.</p>

					<p>Phase conjugation in a Kerr nonlinear waveguide is studied with counter-propagating normally incident pumps and a probe beam at an arbitrary angle of incidence. Detailed numerical results for the specular and phase conjugated reﬂectivities are obtained with full account of pump depletion. For sufﬁcient strengths of the pump a normal mode splitting is demonstrated in both the specular and the phase conjugated reﬂectivities of the probe wave.

				<abstract>
					<p>We present a random matrix ensemble where real, positive semi-deﬁnite matrix elements, $x$, are log-normal distributed, $\exp[-\log^{2}(x)]$. We show that the level density varies with energy, $E$, as $2/(1 + E)$ for large $E$, in the unitary family, consistent with the expectation for disordered conductors. The two-level correlation function is studied for the unitary family and found to be largely of the universal form despite the fact that the level density has a non-compact support. The results are based on the method of orthogonal polynomials (the Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials here). An interesting random walk problem associated with the joint probability distribution of the ensuing ensemble is discussed and its connection with level dynamics is brought out. It is further proved that Dyson's Coulomb gas analogy breaks down whenever the conﬁning potential is given by a transcendental function for which there exist orthogonal polynomials.</p>

				<page>0423-0429</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper attempts to study the Neel temperature of bilayer antiferromagnetic cuprate YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.2}$ within anisotropic Heisenberg model. The double time Green’s function formalism within random phase approximation (RPA) has been used to obtain various correlation functions. The magnetization and the Neel temperature $(T_{N})$ are evaluated. It is observed that the ratio of intrabilayer to inplane exchange coupling $(r = J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel})$ plays an important role in the magnetic dynamics of bilayer systems. The recent experimental data of bilayer system YBa$_{2}$ Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.2}$ have been used to estimate the ratio $r$ from the expression for Neel temperature. The estimated values of spin gap and the ratio of hopping matrix elements $t_{\perp}=t_{\parallel}$ are found to be in fairly good agreement with the existing experimental results.</p>

				<title>On Hamiltonian formulation of cosmologies</title>
				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0441-0445</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Novello et al [1,2] have shown that it is possible to ﬁnd a pair of canonically conjugate variables (written in terms of gauge-invariant variables) so as to obtain a Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of a cosmological system. This opens up the way to the usual technique of quantization. Elbaz et al [4] have applied this method to the Hamiltonian formulation of FRW cosmological equations. This note presents a generalization of this approach to a variety of cosmologies. A general Schrödinger wave equation has been derived and exact solutions have been worked out for the stiff matter era for some cosmological models. It is argued that these solutions appear to hint at their possible relevance in the early phase of cosmological evolution.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The bacteriorhodopsin molecule absorbs light and undergoes a series of structural transformation following a well-deﬁned photocycle. The complex photocycle is transformed to an equivalent level diagram by considering the lifetime of the intermediate states. Assuming that only $B$ and $M$ states are appreciably populated at any instant of time, the level diagram is further simpliﬁed to two-level system. Based on the rate equations for two-level system, an analytic expression for the absorption coefﬁcient of bacteriorhodopsin molecule is derived. It is applied to study the behaviour of absorption coefﬁcient of bacteriorhodopsin ﬁlm in the visible wavelength region of 514 nm. The dependence of absorption coefﬁcient of bacteriorhodopsin ﬁlm on the thickness of the ﬁlm, total number density of active molecules and initial number density of molecules in $B$-state is presented in the graphical form.</p>

Studies of the Standard Model reveal that the latter has a Higgs structure incompatible with existence of observed $B$ asymmetry. We then discuss a generic scenario for electroweak baryogenesis relying on bubble wall dynamics.

				<abstract>
					<p>In addition to being a prime candidate for a fundamental uniﬁed theory of all interactions in nature, string theory provides a natural setting to understand gauge ﬁeld theories. This is linked to the concept of ‘$D$-branes’: extended, solitonic excitations of string theory which can be studied using techniques of string theory and which support gauge ﬁelds localized along their world-volumes. It follows that the techniques of string theory can be very useful even for those particle physicists who are not speciﬁcally interested in uniﬁcation and/or quantum gravity. In this talk I attempt to review how strings help us to understand ﬁelds. The discussion is restricted to $3+1$ spacetime dimensions.</p>

					<p>We argue that with the discovery of neutrino mass effects at super-Kamiokande there is a clear logical chain leading from the standard model through the MSSM and the recently developed minimal left right supersymmetric models with a renormalizable see-saw mechanism for neutrino mass to left right symmetric SUSY GUTS: in particular, SO(10) and SU(2)$_{L}$ $\times$ SU(2)$_{R}$ $\times$ SU(4)$_{c}$.

				<title>Pressure induced phase transition behaviour in $f$-electron based dialuminides</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0685-0708</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rare-earth and actinide based compounds are endowed with several exotic physical and chemical properties due to the presence of $f$-electrons. These properties exhibit interesting changes under the action of various thermodynamic ﬁelds and hence continues to be a subject of extensive research. For instance, under pressure, the nature of $f$-electrons can be changed from localized to itinerant, leading to a variety of changes in their structural, physical and chemical properties. The present review on the high pressure phase transition behaviour of dialuminides of rare earths and actinides is an outcome of research in our laboratory during the last ﬁve years using a unique combination of a Guinier diffractometer and a diamond anvil cell built in-house. To bring out the correlations between the compressibility and structural behaviour with the electronic structure, we have also carried out electronic structure calculation. Further, the usefulness of Villars' three parameter structure maps in predicting pressure induced structural transitions has been explored and this has been illustrated with the available phase transition data.</p>

				<page>0709-0713</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This note presents a method of public key distribution using quantum communication of $n$ photons that simultaneously provides a high probability that the bits have not been tampered. It is a variant of the quantum method of Bennett and Brassard (BB84) where the transmission states have been decreased from 4 to 3 and the detector states have been increased from 2 to 3. Under certain assumptions regarding method of attack, it provides superior performance (in terms of the number of usable key bits) for $n &lt; 18m$, where $m$ is the number of key bits used to verify the integrity of the process in the BB84-protocol.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The junction conditions for a magnetohydrodynamic ﬂuid sphere undergoing dissipative gravitational collapse in the form of a radial heat ﬂux with shear are obtained. These conditions extend particular results of earlier treatments. We demonstrate that the pressure is proportional to the magnitude of the heat ﬂux as is the case in shear-free models. However in our case the gravitational potentials must be solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell system of equations. The mass function $m(v)$ is increased by a factor related to the charge $Q$ of the radiating star. Physical quantities relating to the local conservation of momentum and surface redshift are obtained.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the bulk viscosity of strange quark matter in the density dependent quark mass model (DDQM) and compared results with calculations done earlier in the MIT bag model where $u$, $d$ masses were neglected and ﬁrst order interactions were taken into account. We ﬁnd that at low temperatures and high relative perturbations, the bulk viscosity is higher by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude while at low perturbations the enhancement is by 1–2 order of magnitude as compared to earlier results. Also the damping time is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower implying that the star reaches stability much earlier than in MIT bag model calculations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electron cyclotron plasma reactor are prone to instabilities in speciﬁc input power [3–7] region (150–450 watts). In this region power absorption by gas molecules in the cavity is very poor and enhanced input power gets reﬂected substantially without increasing ion density. There are abrupt changes in plasma characteristics when input power was decreased from maximum to minimum, it was observed that reﬂected power changed from $&lt; 2$% to $\sim 50$%. Minimum two jumps in reﬂected power were noticed in this speciﬁc power region and these appear to be highly sensitive to three stub tuner position in the waveguide for this particular input power zone. Unstable plasma region of this source is found to be dependent upon the magnetic ﬁeld strength. Some changes in reﬂected power are also noticed with pressure, ﬂow and bias and they are random in nature.</p>

				<page>0777-0784</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work, attempts have been made to investigate the modiﬁcation in particle track etching response of polyallyl diglycol carbonate (PADC) due to impact of 2 MeV electrons. PADC samples pre-irradiated to 1, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 Mrad doses of 2 MeV electrons were further exposed to 140 MeV $^{28}$Si beam and dose-dependent track registration properties of PADC have been studied. Etch-rate values of the PADC irradiated to 100 Mrad dose electron was found to increase by nearly 4 times that of pristine PADC. The electron irradiation has promoted chain scissioning in PADC, thereby converting the polymer into an easily etchable polymer. Moreover, the etching response and the detection efﬁciency were found to improve by electron irradiation. Scanning electron microscopy of etched samples further revealed the surface damage in these irradiated PADCs</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We obtain analytic expressions for the energy and polar-angle double differential distributions of a secondary lepton $l^{+}(l^{-})$ arising from the decay of $t (\overline{t})$ in $e^{+}e^{-}\to t\overline{t}$ with an anomalous $tbW$ decay vertex. We also obtain analytic expressions for the various differential cross-sections with the lepton energy integrated over. In this case, we ﬁnd that the angular distributions of the secondary lepton do not depend on the anomalous coupling in the decay, regardless of possible anomalous couplings occurring in the production amplitude for $e^{+}e^{-}\to t\overline{t}$. Our study includes the effect of longitudinal $e^{-}$ and $e^{+}$ beam polarization. We also study the lepton energy and beam polarization dependence of certain CP-violating lepton angular asymmetries arising from an anomalous $tbW$ decay vertex and compare them with the asymmetries arising due to CP-violation in the production process due to the top electric or weak dipole moment.</p>

					<p>It is shown that the analysis of fusion barrier distributions is not always an unambiguous test or a ‘ﬁngerprint’ of the structure information of the colliding nuclei. Examples are presented with same fusion barrier distributions for nuclei having different structures. The fusion excitation functions for $^{16}{\rm O}+^{208}{\rm Pb}$, using the coupled reaction channel (CRC) method and correct structure information, have been analysed. The barrier distributions derived from these excitation functions including many of the signiﬁcant channels are featureless, although these channels have considerable effects on the fusion excitation function. However, a simultaneous analysis of the fusion, elastic and quasi-elastic channels would ﬁx the structure and the reaction unambiguously</p>

				<title>Effect of polarization on population transfer in H$_{2}$ by stimulated Raman transition with partially overlapping laser pulses</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0827-0844</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Polarization effects on population transfer by stimulated Raman transition using overlapping time dependent pump and Stokes laser pulses from the ground $X^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}(v_{g}=0,J_{g}=1)$ level of H$_{2}$ to the ﬁnal $X^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}(v_{f}=1,J_{f}=1)$ level via the intermediate $B^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}(v_{i}=14,J_{i}=0,2)$, $C^{1}\Pi^{+}_{u}(v_{i}=3,J_{i}=2)$ and $C^{1}\Pi^{-}_{u}(v_{i}=3,J_{i}=1)$ levels have been theoretically investigated by applying the density matrix formalism. We have studied in detail the dependence of the population transfer on time delay between two pulses for the cases of on-resonance excitations considering linear parallel and same-sense circular polarizations of the ﬁelds. The pump and Stokes ﬁelds are taken as having Gaussian pulse shapes with peak intensities $I^{0}_{P}(I^{0}_{S})=2\times 10^{6}$ and $1\times 10^{7}$ W/cm$^{2}$. Density matrix equations have been solved for each value of the magnetic quantum number $M_{g}(0,\pm 1)$ of the initial ground level taking into account the $M_{g}$ dependence of the Rabi frequencies. $M_{g}$ – averaged population transfer to the ﬁnal level has also been calculated. For resonance excitations to the $B(14, 0)$ or $C(3,1)$ levels, appreciable population transfer is achieved for intuitive pulse order for some particular values of $M_{g}$ and $M_{i}$ (magnetic quantum number of the resonant intermediate level) depending on the nature of polarizations. The calculated values of $M_{g}$ – averaged population transfer for the two cases of polarizations show that for on-resonance excitation to the $B(14, 0)$ or the $C(3, 1)$ level, linear parallel polarization of the laser ﬁelds yield more transfer efﬁciency whereas for resonance excitation to the $B(14, 2)$ level, larger population transfer results from the same-sense circular polarizations. For resonance excitation to the $C(3, 2)$ level, $M_{g}$ – averaged population is found to be almost polarization independent. The calculations for the six-level H$_{2}$ system reveal some interesting features of polarization effects on the population transfer efﬁciency</p>

					<p>The channelling of 3 MeV protons in the $\langle 110\rangle$ direction of silicon has been simulated using Vineyard model taking into account thermally vibrating nuclei and energy loss due to ionelectron interactions. A beam made up of constant energy particles but with spatial divergence has been simulated for the purpose. The values of the minimum scattering yield and half width of the channelling dip are shown to be depth sensitive and agree well with the measured values. The dependence of yield on the angle of incidence has been found to give information of all three types of channelling. The critical angles for the three types of channelling and wavelength of planar oscillations are consistent with the previous calculations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Hysteresis in cycling through ﬁrst-order phase transitions in vortex matter, akin to the well-studied phenomenon of supercooling of water, has been discussed in literature. Hysteresis can be seen while varying either temperature $T$ or magnetic ﬁeld $H$ (and thus the density of vortices). Our recent work on phase transitions with two control variables shows that the observable region of metastability of the supercooled phase would depend on the path followed in $H-T$ space, and will be larger when $T$ is lowered at constant $H$ compared to the case when $H$ is lowered at constant $T$. We discuss the effect of isothermal ﬁeld variations on metastable supercooled states produced by ﬁeld-cooling. This path dependence is not a priori applicable to metastability caused by reduced diffusivity or hindered kinetics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The growth morphology of crystals of zinc tris(thiourea) sulphate (ZTS) is investigated experimentally, and computed using the Hartman–Perdok approach. Attachment energies of the observed habit faces are calculated for determining their relative morphological importance. A computer code is developed for carrying out these calculations. A special procedure is adopted for computing the cohesive energy of a slice of the structure parallel to any rational crystallographic plane. For estimating the cohesive energies, formal charges on the experimentally determined atomic positions in the molecules of ZTS are calculated by ab initio molecular-orbital computations, with wave functions obtained by the Hartree–Fock procedure. Fairly good agreement with the observed crystal morphology is obtained for a model of growth mechanism in which ZTS is assumed to exist in solution as zinc tris(thiourea) ions and sulphate ions.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0043-0052</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>I present a short overview of current observational results and theoretical models for a cosmological constant. The main motivation for invoking a small cosmological constant (or $\Lambda$-term) at the present epoch has to do with observations of high redshift Type Ia supernovae which suggest an accelerating universe. A ﬂat accelerating universe is strongly favoured by combining supernovae observations with observations of CMB anisotropies on degree scales which give the ‘best-ﬁt’ values $\Omega_{\Lambda}\simeq 0.7$ and $\Omega_{m}\simeq 0.3$. A time dependent cosmological $\Lambda$-term can be generated by scalar ﬁeld models with exponential and power law potentials. Some of these models can alleviate the ‘ﬁne tuning’ problem which faces the cosmological constant.</p>

				<title>Formation of disoriented chiral condensates in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0053-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a brief review of the subject of disoriented chiral condensates (DCC). We describe the conventional scenarios for the formation of DCC which have been proposed in the literature. Observable signals, such as ﬂuctuations in neutral to charged pion ratio, are discussed. We then discuss a novel scenario for DCC formation, recently proposed by us, where the entire region of hot partons can get converted into a single large DCC. Our arguments suggest that formation of such large DCC is unlikely in the collision of heavy nuclei, and ultra-high energy hadronic collisions may be better suited for this.</p>

				<page>0085-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several studies have been made to the hadronic ﬁnal states in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at LEP. Studies of the annihilation process at LEP2 have given rise to results on jet rate, event shape, heavy ﬂavour production, inclusive momentum spectra, Bose–Einstein correlation and colour reconnection effects. Event shape studies have given rise to accurate determination of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_{s}$ using $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{2}_{s})$ with resummed leading and next-to-leading log calculation and also with power law corrections. Studies of 2-photon processes have yielded results on $\gamma\gamma$ cross-section, heavy ﬂavour production, photon structure function and $\gamma^{\ast}\gamma^{\ast}$ scattering.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), deﬁned on a discrete space–time lattice, leads to a spectacular non-perturbative prediction of a new state of matter, called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), at sufﬁciently high temperatures or equivalently large energy densities. The experimental programs of CERN, Geneva and BNL, New York of relativistic heavy ion collisions are expected to produce such energy densities, thereby providing us a chance to test the above prediction. After a brief introduction of the necessary theoretical concepts, I will present a critical review of the experimental results already obtained by the various experiments in order to examine whether QGP has already been observed by them.</p>

					<p>We argue that the discovery of neutrino mass effects at super-Kamiokande implies a clear logical chain leading from the Standard Model, through the MSSM and the recently developed minimal left right supersymmetric models with a renormalizable see-saw mechanism for neutrino mass, to left right symmetric SUSY GUTS: in particular, SO(10) and ${\rm SU}(2)_{L}\times {\rm SU}(2)_{R}\times {\rm SU}(4)_{c}$. The progress in constructing such GUTS explicitly is reviewed and their testability/falsiﬁability by lepton ﬂavour violation and proton decay measurements emphasized.

					<p>I brieﬂy review a scenario where $R$-parity is explicitly broken through a term bilinear in  the lepton and Higgs superﬁelds in the superpotential. An immediate consequence of the presence of this term is the generation of a massive neutrino at the tree level. Constraints on the parameter space are discussed in the context of recent super-Kamiokande results on atmospheric neutrinos. The testability of such models is emphasized through the observation of comparable numbers of muons and taus, produced together with the $W$-boson, in decays of the lightest neutralino. Some other phenomenological implications of such a scenario are also discussed.</p>

In particular it guarantees the vanishing of the dangerous phases that were at the root of the so called SUSY CP problem. Such a symmetric gauge structure is independently motivated by the smallness of neutrino masses that arise via seesaw mechanism automatic in the theory. The minimal version of this theory also provides an explanation of the smallness of $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ as a consequence of the high scale parity invariance.</p>

				<title>Exotic decay in Ba isotopes via $^{12}$C emission</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0375-0382</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Considering Coulomb and proximity potentials as barriers, we have calculated the half lives for $^{12}$C emission from various Ba isotopes using different mass tables. The half life for $^{112}$Ba isotope calculated by us is $6.020\times 10^{3}$ s which is comparable with the experimental value $5.620 \times 10^{3}$ s. From our study it is found that $^{114}$Ba is the good parent for $^{12}$C emission whose emission rate is favorable for measurement. The half lives predicted by us lie very close to those reported by Shanmugam et al using their cubic plus Yukawa plus exponential model. It is observed that inclusion of proximity potential does not produce signiﬁcant deviation from the linear nature of the Geiger–Nuttall plots. Also it is found that the neutron excess in the parent nuclei slows down the exotic decay process.</p>

				<title>Variable operator technique and the min-max theorem</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0383-0392</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate a variation method where the trial function is generated from the application of a variable operator on a reference function. Two conditions are identiﬁed, one for obtaining a maximum and another for a minimum. Although the conditions are easy to understand, the overall formulation is somewhat unusual as each condition gives rise to a two-step variation process. As an example, projection operators are used to form the variable operator, and by this tactics one obtains the new interpretation that the pseudopotential formalism is in fact equivalent to a minimax procedure.</p>
					<p>The two-step variational process is nevertheless more ﬂexible than the pseudopotential formalism, for it can also be used when the variable operator isnot manifestly expressed in terms of projectors. This is illustrated by a comparison of the two-step method with the variational solution of Dirac’s relativistic electron equation. The same comparison leads to an alternative proof that the process of maximizing energy by varying the $u$–$l$ coupling operator eliminates all negative-energy contributions from a trial spinor. The latter observation is crucial for the derivation of the min-max theorem in relativistic quantum mechanics.</p>

					<p>Electron impact single ionization cross sections of copper have been calculated in the binary encounter approximation using accurate expression for $\sigma_{\Delta E}$ as given by Vriens and Hartree–Fock momentum distribution for the target electron. The BEA calculation based on the usual procedure does not show satisfactory agreement with experiment in this case but a striking modiﬁcation is found to be successful in explaining the experimental observations. The discrepancy is linked with the ionization of the $3d^{10}$ electrons and probably effective single ionization does not take place from $3d$ shell of copper leading to smaller values of experimental cross sections.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0455-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Annealing dependence of the lattice parameter, resistivity, magnetoresistance and thermopower have been studied on Nd$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ thin ﬁlms deposited on LaAlO$_{3}$ and alumina substrates by pulsed laser ablation. Upon annealing at 800$^{\circ}$C and 1000$^{\circ}$C the lattice constant of the LaAlO$_{3}$ ﬁlm tends toward that of the bulk target due to reduction in oxygen vacancies. This results in a metal–insulator transition at temperatures which increase with progressive annealing along with a decrease in the observed low temperature MR. Using a magnon scattering model we estimate the eg bandwidth of the ﬁlm annealed at 1000$^{\circ}$C and show that the magnon contribution to the resistivity is suppressed in a highly oxygen deﬁcient ﬁlm and gains prominence only upon subsequent annealing. We also show that upon annealing, the polaron concentration and the spin cluster size increases in the paramagnetic phase, using an adiabatic polaron hopping model which takes into account an exchange dependent activation energy above the resistivity peak.</p>

In particular we pay attention to the effect of the expulsion of the ﬂux of external ﬁelds across charged and rotating black holes which are approaching extremal states. Recently this effect has been shown to occur for black hole solutions in string theory. We also discuss black holes surrounded by rings and disks and rotating black holes accelerated by strings.</p>

Quantum corrections to the semiclassical Bekenstein–Hawking area law for black hole entropy, obtained within the quantum geometry framework, are treated in some detail. Their ramiﬁcation for the holographic entropy bound for bounded stationary spacetimes is discussed.

				<title>Gravitational collapse: The story so far</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0529-0544</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An outstanding problem in gravitation theory and relativistic astrophysics today is to understand the ﬁnal outcome of an endless gravitational collapse. Such a continual collapse would take place when stars more massive than few times the mass of the sun collapse under their own gravity on exhausting their nuclear fuel. According to the general theory of relativity, this results either in a black hole, or a naked singularity – which can communicate with far away observers in the universe. While black holes are (almost) being detected and are increasingly used to model high energy astrophysical phenomena, naked singularities have turned into a topic of active discussion, aimed at understanding their structure and implications. Recent developments here are reviewed, indicating future directions.</p>

				<title>Searching for gravitational waves from rotating neutron stars</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0545-0558</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rotating neutron stars are one of the important sources of gravitational waves (GW) for the ground based as well as space based detectors. Since the waves are emitted continuously, the source is termed as a continuous gravitational wave (CGW) source. The expected weakness of the signal requires long integration times ($\sim$ year). The data analysis problem involves tracking the phase coherently over such large integration times, which makes it the most computationally intensive problem among all GW sources envisaged. In this article, the general problem of data analysis is discussed, and more so, in the context of searching for CGW sources orbiting another companion object. The problem is important because there are several pulsars, which could be deemed to be CGW sources orbiting another companion star. Differential geometric techniques for data analysis are described and used to obtain computational costs. These results are applied to known systems to assess whether such systems are detectable with current (or near future) computing resources.</p>

					<p>This talk presents a brief overview of recent results pertaining to the cosmological constant ‘$\Lambda$’. I summarize the observational situation focussing on observations of high redshift Type Ia supernovae which suggest $\Lambda&gt; 0$. Observations of small angular anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background complement Type Ia supernovae observations and both CMB and Sn can be combined to place strong constraints on the value of $\Lambda$. The presence of a small $\Lambda$-term increases the age of the universe and slows down the formation of large scale structure. I also review recent theoretical attempts to generate a small $\Lambda$-term at the current epoch and a model independent approach for determining the cosmic equation of state.</p>

					<p>Magnetic ﬁelds are observed not only in stars, but in galaxies, clusters, and even high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ systems. In principle, these ﬁelds could play an important role in structure formation and also affect the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). The study of cosmological magnetic ﬁelds aims not only to quantify these effects on large-scale structure and the CMB, but also to answer one of the outstanding puzzles of modern cosmology: when and how do magnetic ﬁelds originate? They are either primordial, i.e. created before the onset of structure formation, or they are generated during the process of structure formation itself.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This is a summary of the papers presented in session W2 on a fairly wide-ranging variety of topics in the area of black hole physics and quantum aspects of gravity, including quantum ﬁeld and string theory in curved spacetimes. In addition, experts in a couple of topical subjects were invited to present short surveys on the subjects of their specialization. The invited speakers were: Mitra, who surveys recent research on the very topical area of AdS black holes, and Date, who presents a comparative perspective on trapping and isolated horizons. Among the contributed papers, the ﬁrst, by Jassal, is an attempt to understand the dynamics of strings near a black hole horizon. This is followed by a paper by Barve et al on a calculation of the quantum stress tensor for a background that includes a naked singularity. Following this we have Singh on radial oscillations of quark stars in strong magnetic ﬁelds. The next paper by Goyal and Dahiya, discusses chiral symmetry restoration in a linear sigma model in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The following paper, by Horwitz, offers new perspectives on the intriguing question of primordial black holes. Finally, Madhavan discusses issues pertaining to the classical limit of kinematical quantum gravity</p>

				<page>0617-0621</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss ways of quantifying structuration in relativistic cosmological settings, by employing a family of covariant density constrast indicators. We study the evolution of these indicators with time in the context of inhomogeneous Szekeres models. We ﬁnd that different observers (having either different spatial locations or different indicators) see different evolutions for the density contrast, which may or may not be monotonically increasing with time. We also ﬁnd that monotonicity seems to be related to the initial conditions of the model, which may be of potential interest in connection with debates regarding gravitational entropy and the arrow of time.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0623-0628</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The introduction of time dependence through a scale factor in a non-conformally ﬂat static cosmological model whose spacetime can be embedded in a ﬁve demensional ﬂat spacetime is shown to give rise to two spherical models of universe ﬁlled with perfect ﬂuid acompannied with radial heat ﬂux without any Big Bang type singularity. The ﬁrst model describes an ever existing universe which witnesses a transition from state of contraction to that of ever expansion. The second model represents a universe oscillating between two regular states.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0665-0683</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Boundary layers are the sites where energy and momentum are exchanged between two distinct plasmas. Boundary layers occurring in space plasmas can support a wide spectrum of plasma waves spanning a frequency range of a few mHz to 100 kHz and beyond. The main characteristics of the broadband plasma waves (with frequencies $&gt;  1$ Hz) observed in the magnetopause, polar cap, and plasma sheet boundary layers are described. The rapid pitch angle scattering of energetic particles via cyclotron resonant interactions with the waves can provide sufﬁcient precipitated energy ﬂux to the ionosphere to create the diffused auroral oval. The broadband plasma waves may also play an important role in the processes of local heating/acceleration of the boundary layer plasma.</p>

				<title>Matched ﬁltering-parameter estimation method and analysis of whistlers recorded at Varanasi</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0685-0691</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The matched ﬁltering technique is based on the digital-construction of theoretical whistlers and their comparison with observed whistlers. The parameters estimated from the theoretical and experimental whistler curves are matched to have higher accuracy using digital ﬁlters. This yields a resolution ten times better in the time domain. We have tested the applicability of this technique for the analysis of whistlers recorded at Varanasi. It is found that the whistlers have propagated along $L&gt; 2$ and have wave normal angles after exiting from the ionosphere such that they propagate towards equator in the earth-ionosphere wave-guide. High-resolution analysis shows the presence of ﬁne structures present in the dynamic spectrum. An effort is made to interpret the results.</p>

					<p>The amplitude scintillations of very high frequency electromagnetic wave transmitted from geo-stationary satellite at 244.168 MHz have been recorded at Varanasi (geom. lat. $14^{\circ}$ $55'$N) during 1991 to 1999. The data are analyzed to determine the statistical features of overhead ionospheric plasma irregularities which are mostly of small duration $&lt; 30$ minutes and are predominant during pre-midnight period. The increase of solar activity generally increases the depth of scintillation. The auto-correlation functions and power spectra of scintillations predict that the scale length of these irregularities varies from 200–500 m having velocity of movement between 75 m/sec to 200 m/sec. These results agree well with the results obtained by other workers.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Edge plasma properties in a tokamak is an interesting subject of study from the view point of conﬁnement and stability of tokamak plasma. The edge plasma of SINP-tokamak has been investigated using specially designed Langmuir probes. We have observed a poloidal asymmetry of ﬂoating potentials, particularly the top-bottom ﬂoating potential differences are quite noticeable, which in turn produces a vertical electric ﬁeld $({\rm\bfseries E}_{v})$. This ${\rm\bfseries E}_{v}$ remains throughout the discharge but changes its direction at certain point of time which seems to depend on applied vertical magnetic ﬁeld $({\rm\bfseries B}_{v})$.</p>

				<title>Mirnov coil data analysis for tokamak ADITYA</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0727-0732</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The spatial and temporal structures of magnetic signal in the tokamak ADITYA is analysed using recently developed singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. The analysis technique is ﬁrst tested with simulated data and then applied to the ADITYA Mirnov coil data to determine the structure of current peturbation as the discharge progresses. It is observed that during the current rise phase, current perturbation undergoes transition from $m = 5$ poloidal structure to $m = 4$ and then to $m = 3$. At the time of current termination, $m = 2$ perturbation is observed. It is observed that the mode frequency remains nearly constant ($\approx$10 kHz) when poloidal mode structure changes from $m = 4$ to $m = 2$. This may be either an indication of mode coupling or a consequences of changes in the plasma electron temperature and density scale length.</p>

				<title>Electron temperature $(T_{e})$ measurements by Thomson scattering system</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0733-0740</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thomson scattering technique based on high power laser has already proved its superoirity in measuring the electron temperature $(T_{e})$ and density $(n_{e})$ in fusion plasma devices like tokamaks. The method is a direct and unambiguous one, widely used for the localised and simultaneous measurements of the above parameters. In Thomson scattering experiment, the light scattered by the plasma electrons is used for the measurements. The plasma electron temperature is measured from the Doppler shifted scattered spectrum and density from the total scattered intensity. A single point Thomson scattering system involving a $Q$-switched ruby laser and PMTs as the detector is deployed in ADITYA tokamak to give the plasma electron parameters. The system is capable of providing the parameters $T_{e}$ from 30 eV to 1 keV and $n_{e}$ from $5 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}-5\times 10^{13}$cm$^{-3}$. The system is also able to give the parameter proﬁle from the plasma center ($Z = 0$ cm) to a vertical position of $Z = +22$ cm to $Z = -14$ cm, with a spatial resolution of 1 cm on shot to shot basis. This paper discusses the initial measurements of the plasma temperature from ADITYA.</p>

				<title>Plasma position control in SST1 tokamak</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0741-0750</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For long duration steady state operation of SST1, it would be very crucial to maintain the plasma radial and vertical positions accurately. For designing the position controller in SST1 we have adopted the simple linear RZIP control model. While the vertical position instability is slowed down by a set of passive stabilizers placed closed to the plasma edge, a pair of in-vessel active feedback coils can adequately control vertical position perturbations of up to 1 cm. The shifts in radial position arising due to minor disruptions would be controlled by a separate pair of poloidal ﬁeld (PF) coils also placed inside the vessel, however the controller would ignore fast but insigniﬁcant changes in radius arising due to edge localised modes. The parameters of both vertical and radial position control coils and their power supplies are determined based on the RZIP simulations.</p>

				<title>Internal magnetic ﬁeld measurement in tokamak plasmas using a Zeeman polarimeter</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0751-0756</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a tokamak plasma, the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle closely depends on the current density proﬁle. We can deduce the internal magnetic ﬁeld from the analysis of circular polarization of the spectral lines emitted by the plasma. The theory of the measurement and a detailed design of the Zeeman polarimeter constructed to measure the poloidal ﬁeld proﬁle in the ADITYA tokamak are presented. The Fabry-Perot which we have employed in our design, with photodiode arrays followed by lock-in detection of the polarization signal, allows the measurement of the fractional circular polarization. In this system He-II line with wavelength 4686 Å is adopted as the monitoring spectral line. The line emission used in the present measurement is not well localized in the plasma, necessiating the use of a spatial inversion procedure to obtain the local values of the ﬁeld.</p>

				<title>Lie-optics, geometrical phase and nonlinear dynamics of self-focusing and soliton evolution in a plasma</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0757-0771</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is useful to state propagation laws for a self-focusing laser beam or a soliton in grouptheoretical form to be called Lie-optical form for being able to predict self-focusing dynamics conveniently and amongst other things, the geometrical phase. It is shown that the propagation of the gaussian laser beam is governed by a rotation group in a non-absorbing medium and by the Lorentz group in an absorbing medium if the additional symmetry of paraxial propagation is imposed on the laser beam. This latter symmetry, however, needs care in its implementation because the electromagnetic wave of the laser sees a different refractive index proﬁle than the laboratory observer in this approximation. It is explained how to estimate this non-Taylor paraxial power series approximation. The group theoretical laws so-stated are used to predict the geometrical or Berry phase of the laser beam by a technique developed by one of us elsewhere. The group-theoretical Lie-optic (or ABCD) laws are also useful in predicting the laser behavior in a more complex optical arrangement like in a laser cavity etc. The nonlinear dynamical consequences of these laws for long distance (or time) predictions are also dealt with. Ergodic dynamics of an ensemble of laser beams on the torus during absorptionless self-focusing is discussed in this context. From the point of view of new physics concepts, we introduce a stroboscopic invariant torus and a stroboscopic generating function in classical mechanics that is useful for long-distance predictions of absorptionless self-focusing.</p>

Observation of some high frequency ﬂuctuations superimposed on ion saturation current along with structuring in the pin hole images of x-ray emitting plasma plume indicate the presence of instability in the plasma. Two type of slope in the variation of x-ray emission with laser intensity in the absence and presence of magnetic ﬁeld shows appearance of different threshold intensity of laser corresponding to each magnetic ﬁeld at which this instability or density ﬂuctuation sets on.

				<abstract>
					<p>An intense laser radiation ($10^{12}$ to $10^{14}$ W/cm$^{-2}$) focused on the solid target creates a hot ($\geq 1$ keV) and dense plasma having high ionization state. The multiple charged ions with high current densities produced during laser matter interaction have potential application in accelerators as an ion source. This paper presents generation and detection of highly stripped titanium ions (Ti) in laser produced plasma. An Nd:glass laser (KAMETRON) delivering 50 J energy ($\lambda = 0.53$ $\mu$m) in 2.5 ns was focused onto a titanium target to produce plasma. This plasma was allowed to drift across a space of $\sim 3$ m through a diagnostic hole in the focusing mirror before ions are ﬁnally detected with the help of electrostatic ion analyzer. Maximum current density was detected for the charge states of $+16$ and $+17$ of Ti ions for laser intensity of $\sim 10^{14}$ W/cm$^{-2}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An investigation of x-ray emission from Cu plasma produced by 1.054 $\mu$m Nd:glass laser pulses of 5 ns duration, at $2\times 10^{12}-2 \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$ is reported. The x-ray emission has been studied as a function of target position with respect to the laser beam focus position. It has been observed that x-ray emissions from ns duration plasma show a volume effect similar to subnanosecond plasmas. Due to this effect the x-ray yield increases when target is moved away relative to the best focal plane of the laser beam. This result supports the theoretical model of Tallents and has also been testiﬁed independently using suitably modiﬁed theoretical model for our experimental conditions. While above result is in good agreement with similar experimental results obtained for sub-nanosecond laser produced plasmas, it differs from result claiming ﬁlamentation rather than pure geometrical effect leading to x-ray enhancement for ns plasmas.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The x-ray emission from slab targets of copper irradiated by Nd:glass laser (1.054 $\mu$m, 5 and 15 ns) at intensities between $10^{12}$ and $10^{14}$W/cm2 has been studied. The x-ray emissions were monitored with the help of high quantum efﬁciency x-ray silicon photo diodes and vacuum photo diodes, all covered with aluminium ﬁlters of different thickness. The x-ray intensity vs the laser intensity has a scaling factor of (1.2–1.92). The relative x-ray conversion efﬁciency follows an empirical relationship which is in close agreement with the one reported by Babonneau et al. The ion velocities were monitored using Langmuir probes placed at different angles and radial distances from the target position. The variation of the ion velocity with the laser intensity follows a scaling of the form $\Phi^{\beta}$ where $\beta\sim 0.22$ which is in good agreement with the reported scaling factor values. The results on the x-ray emission from Cu plasma are reported.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0803-0811</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Growth of a radially symmetrical ripple, superimposed on a Gaussian laser beam in collisional unmagnetised plasma is investigated. From numerical computation, it is observed that self-focusing of main beam as well as ripple determine the growth dynamics of ripple with the distance of propagation. The effect of growing ripple on excitation of ion acoustic wave (IAW) has also been studied</p>

					<p>Propagation algorithm for computer simulation of stationary paraxial self-focusing laser beam in a medium with saturating nonlinearity is given in Lie-optic form. Accordingly, a very natural piece-wise continuous Lie transformation that reduces to a restricted Lorentz group of the beam results. It gives rise to a matrix method for self-focusing beam propagation that is constructed and implemented. Although the results use plasma nonlinearities of saturable type, and a gaussian initial beam, these results are applicable for other media like linear optical ﬁbers and to more general situations.</p>

				<title>Plasma dynamics from laser ablated solid lithium</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0823-0833</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Emission plasma plume generated by pulsed laser ablation of a lithium solid target by a ruby laser (694 nm, 20 ns, 3 J) was subjected to optical emission spectroscopy: time and space resolved optical emission was characterised as a function of distance from the target surface. Propagation of the plume was studied through ambient background of argon gas. Spectroscopic observations can, in general, be used to analyse plume structure with respect to an appropriate theoretical plasma model. The plume expansion dynamics in this case could be explained through a shock wave propagation model wherein, the experimental observations made were seen to ﬁt well with the theoretical predictions. Spectral information derived from measurement of peak intensity and line width determined the parameters, electron temperature $(T_{e})$ and electron number density $(n_{e})$, typically used to characterise laser produced plasma plume emission. These measurements were also used to validate the assumptions underlying the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, invoked for the high density laser plasma under study. Some interesting results pertaining to the analysis of plume structure and spatio-temporal behaviour of $T_{e}$ and $n_{e}$ along the plume length will be presented and discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A plasma channel produced by a short ionising laser pulse is axially nonuniform resulting from the self-defocusing. Through such preformed plasma channel, when a delayed pulse propagates, the phenomena of diffraction, refraction and self-phase modulation come into play. We have solved the nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation governing the propagation characteristics for an approximate analytical solution using variational approach. Results are compared with the theoretical model of Liu and Tripathi (Phys. Plasmas ${\rm\bfseries 1}$, 3100 (1994)) based on paraxial ray approximation. Particular emphasis is on both beam width and longitudinal phase delay which are crucial to many applications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Colloidal plasma is a distinct class of the impure plasmas with multispecies ionic composition. The distinction lies in the phase distribution of the impurity-ion species. The ability to tailor the electrostatic interactions between these colloidal particles provides a fertile ground for scientists to investigate the fundamental aspects of the Coulomb phase transition behavior. The present contribution will review the basic physics of the charging mechanism of the colloidal particles as well as the physics of the collective normal mode behavior of the general multi-ion species plasmas. Emphasis will be laid on the clariﬁcation of the prevailing confusing ideas about distinct qualities of the various acoustic modes, which are likely to exist in colloidal plasmas as well as in normal multi-ion species plasmas. Introductory ideas about the proposed physical models for the Coulomb phase transition in colloidal plasma will also be discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Theoretical prediction of a new kind of normal mode behaviour of electro-mechanical nature was ﬁrst time reported by Dwivedi and Das in 1992 in the context of mesospheric modeling of observed neutral induced turbulence. Local dynamo action (due to relative neutral ﬂow) governs the basic physical principle for linear excitation of the neutral induced low frequency instability (NILF) in mesospheric plasma, which comprises of weakly ionized inhomogeneous gas conﬁned by the external gravity and ambient magnetic ﬁeld. The present contribution offers physical explanation in terms of dynamo transformation of neutral drag effect as a source to understand complete suppression of the usual collisional R-T and in turn linear driving of the NILF. It is therefore emphasized, worth calling it as the dynamo instability.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of nonthermal ion distribution and ﬁnite dust temperature are incorporated in the investigation of nonlinear dust acoustic waves in an unmagnetized dusty plasma. Sagdeev pseudopotential method which takes into account the full nonlinearity of plasma equations, is used here to study solitary wave solutions. Possibility of co-existence of refractive and compressive solitons as a function of Mach number, dust temperature and concentration of nonthermal ions, is considered. For the ﬁxed value of nonthermal ions, it is found that the effect of increase in dust temperature is to reduce the range of co-existence of compressive and refractive solitons. Particular concentration of nonthermal ions results in disappearance of refractive solitons while the decrease in dust temperature, at this concentration restores the lost refractive solitons.</p>

					<p>Considering the Boltzmann response of the ions and electrons in plasma dynamics and inertial dynamics of the dust charged grains in a highly collisional dusty plasma, the nature of the electrostatic potential near a boundary is investigated. Based on the ﬂuid approximation, the formation as well as the characteristic behaviours of the sheath is studied.

				<title>Arc root dynamics in high power plasma torches – Evidence of chaotic behavior</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0873-0886</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although plasma torches have been commercially available for about 50 years, areas such as plasma gun design, process efﬁciency, reproducibility, plasma stability, torch lives etc. have remained mostly unattended. Recent torch developments have been focusing on the basic understanding of the plasma column and its dynamics inside the plasma torch, the interaction of plasma jet and the powders, the interaction of the plasma jet with surroundings and the impingement of the jet on the substrate. Two of the major causes of erratic and poor performance of a variety of thermal plasma processes are currently identiﬁed as the ﬂuctuations arising out of the arc root movement on the electrodes inside the plasma torch and the ﬂuid dynamic instabilities arising out of entrainment of the air into the plasma jet. This paper reviews the current state of understanding of these ﬂuctuations as well as the dynamics of arc root movement in plasma torches. The work done at the author’s laboratory on studying the ﬂuctuations in arc voltage, arc current, acoustic emissions and optical emissions are also presented. These ﬂuctuations are observed to be chaotic and interrelated. Real time monitoring and controlling the arc instabilities through chaos characterization parameters can greatly contribute to the understanding of electrode erosion as well as improvement of plasma torch lifetime.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A self-consistent kinetic treatment is presented here, where the Boltzmann equation is solved for a particle conserving Krook collision operator. The resulting equations have been implemented numerically. The treatment solves for the entire quasineutral column, making no assumptions about $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}/L$, where $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ is the ion-neutral collision mean free path and $L$ the size of the device. Coulomb collisions are neglected in favour of collisions with neutrals, and the particle source is modeled as a uniform Maxwellian. Electrons are treated as an inertialess but collisional ﬂuid. The ion distribution function for the trapped and the transiting orbits is obtained. Interesting ﬁndings include the anomalous heating of ions as they approach the presheath, the development of strongly non-Maxwellian features near the last $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$, and strong modiﬁcations of the sheath criterion.</p>

					<p>The variation of electron temperature and plasma density in a magnetized $N_{2}$ plasma is studied experimentally in presence of a grid placed at the middle of the system. Plasma leaks through the negatively biased grid from the source region into the diffused region. It is observed that the electron temperature increases with the magnetic ﬁeld in the diffused region whereas it decreases in the source region of the system for a constant grid biasing voltage. Also, investigation is done to see the change of electron temperature with grid biasing voltage for a constant magnetic ﬁeld. This is accompanied by the study of the variation of sheath structure across the grid for different magnetic ﬁeld and grid biasing voltage as well. It reveals that with increasing magnetic ﬁeld and negative grid biasing voltage, the sheath thickness expands.</p>

				<title>CAMAC based continuous/transient digitizer for long duration discharge</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0911-0918</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With the development of fusion research, in the next generation tokamak like SST1 and ITER the tokamak discharge duration time of the order of 1000 sec is planned. At the same time acquisition of rapid changes of plasma parameters during discharge is required and this demands for higher sampling rate to acquire the data. Hence a large size of RAM (memory) is required to fulﬁll the above requirements but normally CAMAC based digitizer has limited on-board RAM which can be emptied only after the buffer is completely ﬁlled. Therefore, acquisition period is dependent on sampling frequency of the signal as well as on existing size of RAM. This drawback of above is overcome in this design of CAMAC based digitizer where we are using combination of FIFO memory and RAM to get continuous lossless acquisition as well as transient acquisition. This paper includes design of 4-channel CAMAC digitizer with 32 K samples RAM per channel for on-board storage and 8 K samples FIFO per channel for continuous acquisition. The module can be operated in different modes like monitoring, transient acquisition and continuous lossless acquisition with selectable sampling rate</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple and very efﬁcient gas jet levitation technique for levitating inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) targets has been developed. A low velocity gas jet through diverging nozzle generates precisely controlled low Reynolds number ﬂow pattern, capable of levitating polymer microballoons up to 2500 $\mu$m diameter. Different shaped diverging nozzle are investigated, satisfactory levitation is achieved with simple conical shapes. With this setup microballoon can be levitated for hours with excellent stability, continuous rotation and at the desired height (reproducible with in less than 100 $\mu$m). The height of stabilization depends upon cone angle of diverging nozzle and velocity of levitating gas. This technique is very robust and highly insensitive to external disturbances like nonuniform temperature ﬁelds and vibrations.</p>
					<p>This setup is very economical to fabricate, easy to operate and can be used efﬁciently in various spray coating application involving plastic and metallic layers on microballoons.</p>

				<title>Plasma sprayed alumina coatings for radiation detector development</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0927-0932</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Conventional design of radiation detectors uses sintered ceramic insulating modules. The major drawback of these ceramic components is their inherent brittleness. Ion chambers, in which these ceramic spacers are replaced by metallic components with plasma spray coated alumina, have been developed in our Research Centre. These components act as thin spacers that have good mechanical strength as well as high electrical insulation and replace alumina insulators with the same dimensions. As a result, the design of the beam loss monitor ion chamber for CAT could be simpliﬁed by coating the outer surface of the HT electrode with alumina. One of the chambers developed for isotope calibrator for brachytherapy gamma sources has its outer aluminium electrode (60 mm dia $\times$ 220 mm long) coated with 250 $\mu$ thick alumina (97%) + titania (3%).</p>
					<p>In view of potential applications in neutron-sensitive ion chambers used in reactor control instrumentation, studies were carried out on alumina 100 $\mu$ to 500 $\mu$ thick coatings on copper, aluminium and SS components. The electrical insulation varied from $10^{8}$ ohms to $10^{12}$ ohms for coating thicknesses above 200 $\mu$. The porosity in the coating resulted in some fall in electrical insulation due to moisture absorption. An improvement could be achieved by providing the ceramic surface with moisture-repellent silicone oil coating. Irradiation at Apsara reactor core location showed that the coating on aluminium was found to be unaffected after exposure to $10^{17}$ nvt ﬂuence.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The promising applications of the microwave plasmas have been appearing in the ﬁelds of chemical processes and semiconductor manufacturing. Applications include surface deposition of all types including diamond/diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings, etching of semiconductors, promotion of organic reactions, etching of polymers to improve bonding of the other materials etc. With a 2.45 GHz, 700 W, microwave induced plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system set up in our laboratory we have deposited diamond like carbon coatings. The microwave plasma generation was effected using a wave guide single mode applicator. We have deposited DLC coatings on the substrates like stainless steel, Cu–Be, Cu and Si. The deposited coatings have been characterized by FTIR, Raman spectroscopy and ellipsometric techniques. The results show that we have achieved depositing $\sim 95\%$ sp$^{3}$ bonded carbon in the ﬁlms. The ﬁlms are uniform with golden yellow color. The ﬁlms are found to be excellent insulators. The ellipsometric measurements of optical constant on silicon substrates indicate that the ﬁlms are transparent above 900 nm.</p>

We are using water as a medium for this process. By discharging the stored electrical energy of the capacitor bank in water, we are getting the desired result i.e. to form (expand or compress) a wide range of workpiece to the desired shapes. The advantage of this method over conventional method is that it uses low power (negligible running cost). It does not require any post assembly cleaning degreasing and is hence environmentally ‘friendly’.</p>

				<title>Minimum dissipative relaxed states in toroidal plasmas</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0947-0952</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relaxation of toroidal discharges is described by the principle of minimum energy dissipation together with the constraint of conserved global helicity. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is solved in toroidal coordinates for an axisymmetric torus by expressing the solutions in terms of Chandrasekhar-Kendall (C-K) eigenfunctions analytically continued in the complex domain. The C-K eigenfunctions are obtained as hypergeometric functions that are solutions of scalar Helmholtz equation in toroidal coordinates in the large aspect-ratio approximation. Equilibria are constructed by assuming the current to vanish at the edge of plasma. For the $m = 0$; $n = 0$ ($m$ and $n$ are the poloidal and toroidal mode numbers respectively) relaxed states, the magnetic ﬁeld, current, $q$ (safety factor) and pressure proﬁles are calculated for a given value of aspect-ratio of the torus and for different values of the eigenvalue $\lambda r_{0}$. The new feature of the present model is that solutions allow for both tokamak as well as RFP-like behaviour with increase in the values of $\lambda r_{0}$, which is related directly to volt-sec in the experiment.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We review the theory of the microscopic modeling of the 5-dim. black hole of type IIB string theory in terms of the $D_{1}-D_{5}$ brane system. A detailed discussion of the low energy effective Lagrangian of the brane system is presented and the black hole micro-states are identiﬁed. These considerations are valid in the strong coupling regime of supergravity due to the non-renormalization of the low energy dynamics in this model. Using Maldacena duality and standard statistical mechanics methods one can account for black hole thermodynamics and calculate the absorption cross section and the Hawking radiation rates. Hence, at least in the case of this model black hole, since we can account for black hole properties within a unitary theory, there is no information paradox.</p>

					<p>We critically review the $\Lambda\Lambda$ dynamics by examining $\Lambda-\Lambda$ and $\Lambda$-nucleon phenomenological potentials in the study of the bound state properties of double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei $^{6}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$He, $^{10}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Be, $^{14}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$C, $^{18}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$O, $^{22}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Ne, $^{26}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Mg, $^{30}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Si, $^{34}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$S, $^{38}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Ar, $^{42}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Ca, $^{46}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Ti, $^{50}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Cr, $^{54}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Fe, $^{58}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Ni, $^{62}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Zn, $^{66}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Ge, $^{70}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Se, $^{74}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Kr, $^{78}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Sr, $^{82}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Zr, $^{86}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Mo, $^{90}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Ru, $^{94}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Pd, $^{98}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Cd, $^{102}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Sn in the frame work of (core $+\Lambda+\Lambda$) three body model. An effective $\Lambda N$ potential is obtained by folding the phenomenological $\Lambda N$ potential into the density distribution of the core nuclei. The former two cases (i.e. $^{6}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$He and $^{10}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Be) are revisited to justify the correctness of the present potential model. Assuming the same potential model we predicted some of the structural properties of heavier doubly $\Lambda$-hypernuclei. The hyperspherical harmonics expansion method, which is an essentially exact method has been employed for the three body system. A convergence in binding energy up to 0.15% for $K_{\max} = 20$ has been achieved. In our calculation we have made no approximation in restricting the allowed $l$-values of the interacting pairs.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper an alternative approach for measurement of $\sigma\tau$ product for $^{4}F_{3/2}\to  {}^{4}I_{11/2}$ transition of Nd$^{3+}$ doped YVO$_{4}$ crystal is reported. In this method a microchip laser is formed by keeping a small piece of the sample in plane–plane resonator and a diode laser (808 nm) is used for pumping. The pump power induced thermal lensing effect is used to make the cavity stable. The cavity mode area is estimated by measuring the thermal lens focal length at the threshold and the average pump area is measured by Gaussian ﬁt to the intensity proﬁles of the pump beam. The value of $\sigma\tau$ product of Nd:YVO$_{4}$ crystal obtained by this method is within 10% of the reported values. The advantage of this method is that it is a simple method for direct measurement of $\sigma\tau$ product of laser crystals.</p>

					<p>The vibronic vapour phase photoacoustic spectrum of Br$_{2}$ in the wavelength region 505–541 nm (19796–18480 cm$^{-1}$) has been recorded using microphone as well as pump-probe method. Discrete vibronic bands superimposed on a monotonically increasing continuum background towards the dissociation limit results from the overlapping $B^{3}\Pi^{+}_{0u}\leftarrow X^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}$ and $^{1}\Pi_{1u}\leftarrow X^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}$ electronic transitions. Vibronic bands originating from $v'' = 0$ have been used to estimate the relative rate of non-radiative relaxation as a function of the excited state $B$ $^{3}\Pi_{0u}$ vibrational quantum number $v'$. A comparison with the optical absorption spectroscopy of Br$_{2}$ leads to the identiﬁcation of three broad spectral regions between 505 and 541 nm (19796 and 18480 cm$^{-1}$) on the basis of different non-radiative relaxation processes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of the radiative cooling of electrons on the gravitational collapse of cold dust grains with ﬂuctuating electric charge is investigated. We ﬁnd that the radiative cooling as well as the charge ﬂuctuations, both, enhance the growth rate of the Jeans instability. However, the Jeans length, which is zero for cold grains and nonradiative plasma, becomes ﬁnite in the presence of radiative cooling of electrons and is further enhanced due to charge ﬂuctuations of grains resulting in an increased threshold of the spatial scale for the Jeans instability.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In subnormal glow discharge under d.c. excitation at different pressure in a varying transverse magnetic ﬁeld (0 to 30 G) some measurements have been carried out for various initial average tube currents. The voltage across the discharge increases and average tube current and residual current decreases in the magnetic ﬁeld. With the help of Beckman’s expression [4] for the axial ﬁeld and the electron density distribution in a transverse magnetic ﬁeld the observed variation of current and voltage can be satisfactorily explained. The variation of axial electric ﬁeld with transverse magnetic ﬁeld can be represented to a fair degree of accuracy by the derived equation. The behaviour of residual current with magnetic ﬁeld has been observed in these oscillations.</p>

					<p>The area enclosed by hysteresis loops in a periodically forced bistable microscopic system at zero-temperature is examined by using the time dependent Hellmann–Feynman theorem and the Fourier grid Hamiltonian recipe for solving time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Effects of non-zero temperatures are explored with reference to a symmetric double well potential. The barrier crossing or, relaxation rates are shown to correlate systematically with the area of the loop. The possible use of hysteresis loop area in designing ﬁeld parameters for optimal control is suggested.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0179-0187</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tripartite entangled states of systems 1, 2 and 3 involving nonorthogonal states are used to reveal two hitherto unexplored quantum effects. The ﬁrst shows that kinematic entanglement between the states of 1 and 2 can affect the result of dynamical interaction between 2 and 3, though 1 and 2 may be spatially separated so that they no longer interact. The second shows that if a residual interaction persists between 1 and 2 while 2 interacts with 3 to form an entangled state, the measurement of observables of 1 can be used to determine whether 2 has interacted with 3. This effect occurs even when the measurement on 1 is made long after the residual interaction between 1 and 2 has ceased to act. Such effects resulting from interplay between unitary dynamics and kinematic entanglement have interesting implications. In particular, we discuss the signiﬁcance as regards what we call the dynamic version of Einstein locality</p>

					<p>Recently it has been demonstrated that Bell inequalities for spin 1/2 particles must be modiﬁed if unsharp spin observables are considered, and furthermore, the modiﬁed Bell inequalities may not be violated by quantum mechanics if the observables are sufﬁciently unsharp. In case of massive particles there may be more imperfection than seems to appear in the photon EPR experiments. So the experiment proposed by Fry, Walther and Li can place experimental limits on the unsharpness of spin variables. It sheds new light on the much debated issues like non-local correlations in quantum mechanics.</p>

In particular, it is puzzlingly time-asymmetric. The paper begins with a summary of the case for considering hidden variable models which, in abandoning this independence assumption, allow a degree of ‘backward causation’. The remainder of the paper clariﬁes the physical signiﬁcance of such models, in relation to the issue as to whether quantum mechanics provides a complete description of physical reality.</p>

				<page>0223-0237</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Any two inﬁnite-dimensional (separable) Hilbert spaces are unitarily isomorphic. The sets of all their self-adjoint operators are also therefore unitarily equivalent. Thus if all self-adjoint operators can be observed, and if there is no further major axiom in quantum physics than those formulated for example in Dirac’s ‘quantum mechanics’, then a quantum physicist would not be able to tell a torus from a hole in the ground. We argue that there are indeed such axioms involving observables with smooth time evolution: they contain commutative subalgebras from which the spatial slice of spacetime with its topology (and with further reﬁnements of the axiom, its $C^{K}$ - and $C^{\infty}$ - structures) can be reconstructed using Gel’fand–Naimark theory and its extensions. Classical topology is an attribute of only certain quantum observables for these axioms, the spatial slice emergent from quantum physics getting progressively less differentiable with increasingly higher excitations of energy and eventually altogether ceasing to exist. After formulating these axioms, we apply them to show the possibility of topology change and to discuss quantized fuzzy topologies. Fundamental issues concerning the role of time in quantum physics are also addressed.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0321-0331</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The analysis of the Aharanov–Bohm phase and other similar physical effects in this paper is motivated by the philosophy that all physical changes, including phase changes, should originate in one of the local physical interactions even if they are described elegantly and concisely as topological or geometric changes. The topological or geometric nature comes about either due to an additional physical principle or due to certain special spatial or temporal property of the ﬁelds from the source. Similar remarks apply to rotation or precession of polarization and spin vectors. As a primary example I describe the Aharanov–Bohm phase as arising from the Coulomb interaction of a charge in the electrostatic potential created by other charges. The topological nature comes about because the interaction energy has zero gradient throughout space, except in a compact region enclosed by the quantum paths. This analysis brings out the unifying aspects of the scalar and the vector A–B effects, and the Aharanov–Casher phase. Then I discuss two other related problems with descriptions in the geometrical and the interaction pictures; I discuss how quantum complementarity is realized without the Heisenberg back action on momentum in certain atom interferometry experiments. In the second example, I show that the Thomas precession of the spin results from the local torque in the accelero-magnetic ﬁeld, a ﬁeld predicted in analogy with the gravitomagnetic ﬁeld. I end the discussion with some remarks on the classical nature of fringe shifts in Aharanov–Bohm like phenomena in electromagnetism and gravitation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Entanglement, one of the most important features of quantum mechanics, is at the core of the famous Einstein–Bohr philosophical debate [1] and is the principal resource for quantum information processing [2]. We report on new experimental investigations of the properties of entangled photon pairs with emphasis on the tension between quantum mechanics and relativity [3,4]. Entangled photons are sent via an optical ﬁber network to two villages near Geneva, separated by more than 10 km where they are analyzed by interferometers [5]. The photon pair source is set as precisely as possible in the center so that the two photons arrive at the detectors within a time interval of less than 5 ps (corresponding to a path length difference of less than 1 mm). This sets a lower bound on the ‘speed of quantum information’ to $10^{7}$ times the speed of light. Next, one detector is set in motion [6] so that both detectors, each in its own inertial reference frame, are ﬁrst to do the measurement! The data always reproduces the quantum correlations.</p>

Identiﬁcation of a base-pairing with a quantum query gives a natural (and ﬁrst ever!) explanation of why living organisms have 4 nucleotide bases and 20 amino acids. It is amazing that these numbers arise as solutions to an optimisation problem. Components of the DNA structure which implement Grover’s algorithm are identiﬁed, and a physical scenario is presented for the execution of the quantum algorithm. It is proposed that enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining quantum coherence of the process. Experimental tests that can verify this scenario are pointed out.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present a rare example of a decay mechanism playing a constructive role in quantum information processing. We show how the state of an atom trapped in a cavity can be teleported to a second atom trapped in a distant cavity by the joint detection of photon leakage from the cavities. The scheme, which is probabilistic, requires only a single three level atom in a cavity. We also show how this scheme can be modiﬁed to a teleportation with insurance.</p>

				<page>0393-0401</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We propose a method called ‘coherence swapping’ which enables us to create superposition of a particle in two distinct paths, which is fed with initially incoherent, independent radiation. This phenomenon is also present for the charged particles, and can be used to swap the effect of ﬂux line due to the Aharonov–Bohm effect. We propose an optical version of experimental set-up to test the coherence swapping. The phenomenon, which is simpler than entanglement swapping or teleportation, raises some fundamental questions about the true nature of wave-particle duality, and also opens up the possibility of studying the quantum erasure from a new angle.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study spin tunnelling in molecular magnets as an instance of a mesoscopic phenomenon, with special emphasis on the molecule Fe$_{8}$. We show that the tunnel splitting between various pairs of Zeeman levels in this molecule oscillates as a function of applied magnetic ﬁeld, vanishing completely at special points in the space of magnetic ﬁelds, known as diabolical points. This phenomena is explained in terms of two approaches, one based on spin-coherent-state path integrals, and the other on a generalization of the phase integral (or WKB) method to difference equations. Explicit formulas for the diabolical points are obtained for a model Hamiltonian.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Universal statistical aspects of wave scattering by a variety of physical systems ranging from atomic nuclei to mesoscopic systems and microwave cavities are described. A statistical model for the scattering matrix is employed to address the problem of quantum chaotic scattering. The model, introduced in the past in the context of nuclear physics, discusses the problem in terms of a prompt and an equilibrated component: it incorporates the average value of the scattering matrix to account for the prompt processes and satisﬁes the requirements of ﬂux conservation, causality and ergodicity. The main application of the model is the analysis of electronic transport through ballistic mesoscopic cavities: it describes well the results from the numerical solutions of the Schrödinger equation for two-dimensional cavities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mesoscopic systems have provided an opportunity to study quantum effects beyond the atomic realm. In these systems quantum coherence prevails over the entire sample. We discuss several novel effects related to persistent currents in open systems which do not have analogues in closed systems. Some phenomena arising simultaneously due to two non-classical effects namely, Aharonov–Bohm effect and quantum tunneling are presented. Simple analysis of sharp phase jumps observed in double-slit Aharonov–Bohm experiments is given. Some consequences of parity violation are elaborated. Finally, we brieﬂy describe the dephasing of Aharonov–Bohm oscillations in Aharonov–Bohm ring geometry due to spin-ﬂip scattering in one of the arms. Several experimental manifestations of these phenomena and their applications are given.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The new millennium will see the upcoming of several ground-based interferometric gravitational wave antennas. Within the next decade a space-based antenna may also begin to observe the distant Universe. These gravitational wave detectors will together operate as a network taking data continuously for several years, watching the transient and continuous phenomena occurring in the deep cores of astronomical objects and dense environs of the early Universe where gravity was extremely strong and highly nonlinear. The network will listen to the waves from rapidly spinning non-axisymmetric neutron stars, normal modes of black holes, binary black hole inspiral and merger, phase transitions in the early Universe, quantum ﬂuctuations resulting in a characteristic background in the early Universe. The gravitational wave antennas will open a new window to observe the dark Universe unreachable via other channels of astronomical observations.</p>

					<p>We develop a stochastic formulation of cosmology in the early universe, after considering the scatter in the redshift-apparent magnitude diagram in the early epochs as an observational evidence for the non-deterministic evolution of early universe. We consider the stochastic evolution of density parameter in the early universe after the inﬂationary phase qualitatively, under the assumption of ﬂuctuating $\omega$ factor in the equation of state, in the Fokker–Planck formalism. Since the scale factor for the universe depends on the energy density, from the coupled Friedmann equations we calculated the two variable probability distribution function assuming a ﬂat space geometry</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Considering the nucleon as consisting entirely of its valence quarks conﬁned independently in a scalar-vector harmonic potential; unpolarized structure functions $F_{1}(x,\mu^{2})$ and $F_{2}(x,\mu^{2})$ are derived in the Bjorken limit under certain simplifying assumptions; from which valence quark distribution functions $u_{v}(x,\mu^{2})$ and $d_{v}(x,\mu^{2})$ are appropriately extracted satisfying the normalization constraints. QCD-evolution of these input distributions from a model scale of $\mu^{2}=0.07$ GeV$^{2}$ to a higher $Q^{2}$ scale of $Q^{2}_{0} = 15$ GeV$^{2}$ yields $xu_{v}(x, Q^{2}_{0})$ and $xd_{v}(x, Q^{2}_{0})$ in good agreement with experimental data. The gluon and sea-quark distributions such as $G(x,Q^{2}_{0})$ and $q_{s}(x, Q^{2}_{0})$ are dynamically generated with a reasonable qualitative agreement with the available data; using the leading order renormalization group equations with appropriate valence-quark distributions as the input.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Bounded whistlers are well-known for their efﬁcient plasma production capabilities in thin cylindrical tubes. In this paper we shall present their radio frequency (RF) breakdown and discharge sustaining capabilities in toroidal systems. Pulsed RF power in the electronmagnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) frequency regime is fed to the neutral background medium. After the breakdown stage, discharge is sustained by toroidal bounded whistlers. In these pulsed experiments the behaviour of the time evolution of the discharge could be studied in four distinct phases of RF breakdown, steady state attainment, decay and afterglow. In the steady state average electron density of $\approx 10^{12}$ per cc and average electron temperature of $\approx 20$ eV are obtained at $10^{-3}$ mbar of argon ﬁlling pressure. Experimental results on toroidal mode structure, background effects and time evolution of the electron distribution function will be presented and their implications in understanding the breakdown mechanism are discussed.</p>

					<p>A simple method to generate an effective electron–ion interaction pseudopotential from the energy wave number characteristic obtained by ﬁrst principles calculations has been suggested. This effective potential has been used, in third order perturbation, to study the effect of three-body forces on the lattice dynamics of noble metals. It is found that three-body forces, in these metals, do play an important role. The inclusion of such three-body forces appreciably improves the agreement between the experimental and theoretical phonon dispersion curves.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electrical resistivity $(\rho)$ of the amorphous (a-)Fe$_{100-c}$Zr$_{c}$ ($c = 8.5$, 9.5 and 10) alloys has been measured in the temperature range 77 to 300 K, which embraces the second-order magnetic phase transition at the Curie temperature point $T_{c}$. Analysis of the resistivity data particularly in the critical region reveals that these systems have a much wider range of critical region compared to other crystalline ferromagnetic materials. The value of $T_{c}$ and speciﬁc heat critical exponent, $\alpha$ has the same values as those determined from our earlier magnetic measurements. The value of $\alpha$ for all the present investigated alloys are in close agreement with the values predicted for three-dimensional (3D) Heisenberg ferromagnet systems, which gives contradiction to the earlier results on similar alloys. It is observed from the analysis that the presence of quenched disorder does not have any inﬂuence on critical behavior.</p>

				<title>On conformally related $pp$-waves</title>

				<page>0591-0596</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Brinkmann [1] has shown that conformally related distinct Ricci flat solutions are $pp$-waves. Brinkmann's result has been generalized to include the conformally invariant source terms. It has been shown that [4] if $g_{ik}$ and $\overline{g}_{ik}$ ($=\omega^{-2}g_{ik}$, $\omega$: a scalar function), are distinct metrics having the same Einstein tensor, $G_{ik}=\overline{G}_{ik}$, then both represent (generalized) $pp$-waves and $\omega_{i}$ is a null convariantly constant vector of $g_{ik}$. Thus $pp$-waves are the only candidates which yield conformally related nontrivial solutions of $G_{ik}=T_{ik}=\overline{G}_{ik}$, with $T_{ik}$ being conformally invariant source.</p>
					<p>In this paper the functional form of the conformal factor for the conformally related $pp$-waves/generalized $pp$-waves has been obtained. It has been shown that the most general $pp$-wave, conformally related to ${\rm d}s^{2}=-2{\rm d}u[{\rm d}v-m{\rm d}y+H{\rm d}u]+P^{-2}[{\rm d}y^{2}+{\rm d}z^{2}]$, turns out to the $(au+b)^{-2}{\rm d}s^{2}$, where $a$, $b$ are constants. Only in the special case when $m=0$, $H=1$, and $P=P(y,z)$, the conformal factor is $(au+b)^{-2}$ or $(a(u+v)+b)^{-2}$.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0615-0624</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A one-dimensional stability transport code has been developed to simulate the evolution of tokamak plasma discharges. Explicit finite-difference methods have been used to follow the temporal evolution of the electron temperature equation. The poloidal field diffusion equation has been solved at every time step. The effects of MHD instabilities have been incorporated by solving equations for MHD mixing and tearing modes as and when required. The code has been applied to follow the evolution of tokamak plasma discharges obtained in the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) tokamak. From these simulations, we have been able to identify the possible models of thermal conductivity, diffusion and impurity contents in these discharges. Effects of different MHD modes have been estimated. It has been found that in low $q_{a}$ discharge $m=1$, $n=1$ and $m=2$, $n=1$ modes play major role in discharge evolution. These modes are found to result in the positive jump in the loop voltage which was also observed in the experiments. Hollow current density profile $j_{\phi}$ and negative shear in the $q$ profile have also been found in the rising phase of a discharge.</p>

				<page>0643-0656</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Obliquely propagating ultra-low-frequency dust-electromagnetic waves in a self-gravitating, warm, magnetized, two fluid dusty plasma system have been investigated. Two special cases, namely, dust-Alfvén mode propagating parallel to the external magnetic field and dust-magnetosonic mode propagating perpendicular to the external magnetic field have also been considered. It has been shown that effects of self-gravitational field, dust fluid temperature, and obliqueness significantly modify the dispersion properties of these ultra-low-frequency dust-electromagnetic modes. It is also found that in parallel propagating dust-Alfvén mode these effects play no role, but in obliquely propagating dust-Alfvén mode or perpendicular propagating dust-magnetosonic mode the effect of self-gravitational field plays destabilizing role whereas the effect of dust/ion fluid temperature plays stabilizing role.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0657-0665</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a model in which metastable supercooled phase and stable equilibrium phase of vortex matter coexist in different regions of a sample. Minor hysteresis loops are calculated with the simple assumption of the two phases of vortex matter having field-independent critical current densities. We use our earlier published ideas that the free energy barrier separating the metastable and stable phases reduces as the magnetic induction moves farther from the first order phase transition line, and that metastable to stable transformations occur in local regions of the sample when the local energy dissipation exceeds a critical value. Previously reported anomalous features in minor hysteresis loops are reproduced, and calculated field profiles are presented.</p>

				<title>Experimental evidence of photoinduced valence change of Fe$^{3+}$ in BaTiO$_{3}$ and mechanism for growth of new grating in depleted pump condition: An EPR investigation</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0667-0684</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With a view to understanding the role of photo-induced valence changes of impurities in BaTiO$_{3}$ in the phenomena of photorefraction, EPR experiments were conducted under in situ HeNe laser illumination. These experiments gave evidence for photoinduced valence change of Fe in BaTiO$_{3}$ at room temperature. The EPR signal due to trivalent iron was found to reduce in intensity with laser illumination The kinetics of the valence change has been investigated. Under large fringe width condition, the time constant of the decay is identified as the dielectric relaxation time $\tau_{\text{d}}$. The changes in line shape on laser illumination to Dysonian form, appeared most predominantly in mechanically poled crystal compared to electrically poled single domain crystals. This demonstrated the possible role of domain walls and the defects there, as source or sinks of charge carriers on photo excitation. It is observed, that there is transient growth of Fe$^{3+}$, when the laser illumination was put on, before its decay. This was attributed to charge transfer between electrons in oxygen vacancies and Fe$^{4+}$. This predicted the growth of transient grating under depleted pump condition in a two beam coupling experiment. This was experimentally proved by following the diffracted signal of the reading beam under the depleted pump condition.</p>

					<p>A scheme to execute an $n$-bit Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm using $n$ qubits has been implemented for up to three cubits on an NMR quantum computer. For the one- and the two-bit Deutsch problem, the qubits do not get entangled, and the NMR implementation is achieved without using spin-spin interactions. It is for the three-bit case, that the manipulation of entangled states becomes essential. The interactions through scalar $J$-couplings in NMR spin systems have been exploited to implement entangling transformations required for the three bit DJ algorithm.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the propagation equations for the expansion, vorticity and shear for perfect ﬂuid space-times which are geodesic. It is assumed that space-time admits a conformal Killing vector which is inheriting so that ﬂuid ﬂow lines are mapped conformally. Simple constraints on the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor are found for conformal symmetry. For homothetic vectors the vorticity and shear are free; they vanish for nonhomothetic vectors. We prove a conjecture for conformal symmetries in the special case of inheriting geodesic ﬂows: there exist no proper conformal Killing vectors $(\psi_{;ab}\neq 0)$ for perfect ﬂuids except for Robertson–Walker space-times. For a nonhomothetic vector ﬁeld the propagation of the quantity ln$(R_{ab}u^{a}u^{b})$ along the integral curves of the symmetry vector is homogeneous.</p>

				<title>Resonance propagation in heavy-ion scattering</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0723-0734</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The formalism developed earlier by us for the propagation of a resonance in the nuclear medium in proton–nucleus collisions has been modiﬁed to the case of vector boson production in heavy-ion collisions. The formalism includes coherently the contribution to the observed di-lepton production from the decay of a vector boson inside as well as outside the nuclear medium. The medium modiﬁcation of the boson is incorporated through an energy dependent optical potential. The calculated invariant $\rho$ mass distributions are presented for the $\rho$-meson production using optical potentials estimated within the VDM and the resonance model. The shift in the invariant mass distribution is found to be small. To achieve the mass shift (of about 200 MeV towards lower mass) as indicated in the high energy heavy-ion collision experiments, an unusually strong optical potential of about $-120$ MeV is required. We also observe that, for not so heavy nuclear systems and/or for fast moving resonances, the shape, magnitude and peak position of the invariant mass distribution is substantially different if the contributions from the resonance decay inside and outside are summedup at the amplitude level (coherently) or at the cross section level (incoherently).</p>

					<p>Several measurements of decay energy using the inner Bremsstrahlung spectrum (IB) due to radiative electron capture in $^{55}$Fe has been made. But the results are not uniform. Hence another attempt has been made at the same. Experimental data was obtained with a 4.445 cm. dia $\times 5.08$ cm thick NaI (Tl) detector. It was subjected to suitable statistical treatment and various corrections using Liden and Starfelt procedure. The corrected spectrum agrees well with the Glauber and Martin theory for 1s electron capture beyond 100 keV. From the Jauch plot, the decay energy of $232.36\pm 0.64$ keV was obtained.</p>

				<title>A new method for the calculation of Sommerfeld screening parameter $\sigma_{1}$ in x-ray spectra</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0745-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper describes a new method for the calculation of the Sommerfeld screening parameter $\sigma_{1}$. It requires neither the knowledge of the energy separations of spin doublet levels nor is it based on the application of the Hertz law. The only data required for the calculation are the experimental energy values of the level concerned for the series of elements belonging to the same subshell in which the element in the question is situated. As an illustration the values of $\sigma_{1}$ are calculated for the $L_{1}$, $L_{2}$ and $L_{3}$ levels for elements belonging to the $4f$ subshell and these are found to be in excellent agreement with those published earlier by Gokhale and Misra. The method brings out the constancy of $\sigma_{1}(L_{2}L_{3})-\sigma_{1}(L_{1})$ in a natural way and may thus be regarded as providing theoretical explanation of the Hertz law.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0755-0766</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present paper we have investigated the self-focusing behaviour of radially symmetrical rippled Gaussian laser beam propagating in a plasma. Considering the nonlinearity to arise from relativistic phenomena and following the approach of Akhmanov et al, which is based on the WKB and paraxial-ray approximation, the self-focusing behaviour has been investigated in some detail. The effect of the position and width of the ripple on the self-focusing of laser beam has been studied for arbitrary large magnitude of nonlinearity. Results indicate that the medium behaves as an oscillatory wave-guide. The self-focusing is found to depend on the position parameter of ripple as well as on the beam width. Values of critical power has been calculated for different values of the position parameter of ripple. Effects of axially and radially inhomogeneous plasma on self-focusing behaviour have been investigated and presented here.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We examine using Monte Carlo simulations, photon transport in optically ‘thin’ slabs whose thickness $L$ is only a few times the transport mean free path $l^{\ast}$, with particles of different scattering anisotropies. The conﬁned geometry causes an auto-selection of only photons with looping paths to remain within the slab. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations are borne out by our analytical treatment that incorporates directional persistence by the use of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, which interpolates between the short time ballistic and long time diffusive regimes.</p>

				<title>Role of magnetic shear on the electrostatic current driven ion-cyclotron instability in the presence of parallel electric ﬁeld</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0779-0784</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent observation and theoretical investigations have led to the signiﬁcance of electrostatic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves in the electrodynamics of acceleration process. The instability is one of the fundamental of a current carrying magnetized plasma. The EIC instability has the lowest threshold current among the current driven instabilities. On the basis of local analysis where inhomogeneities like the magnetic shear and the ﬁnite width current channel, have been ignored which is prevalent in the magnetospheric environment. On the basis of non-local analysis interesting modiﬁcation has been incorporated by the inclusion of magnetic shear. In this paper we provide an analytical approach for the non-local treatment of current driven electrostatic waves in presence of parallel electric ﬁeld. The growth rate is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the ﬁeld aligned electron drift. The presence of electric ﬁeld enhances the growth of EIC waves while magnetic shear stabilizes the system.</p>

					<p>Propagation of both low and high frequency waves in a plasma consisting of electrons, ions, positrons and charged dust particles have been theoretically studied. The characteristics of dust acoustic wave propagating through the plasma has been analysed and the dispersion relation deduced is a generalization of that obtained by previous authors. It is found that nonlinear localization of high frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld in such a plasma generates magnetic ﬁeld. This magnetic ﬁeld is seen to depend on the temperatures of electrons and positrons and also on their equilibrium density ratio. It is suggested that the present model would be applicable to ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld generation in space plasma.</p>

				<title>Evolution of nuclear spectroscopy at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0005-0009</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Experimental studies of nuclear excitations have been an important subject from the earliest days when the institute was established. The construction of 4 MeV proton cyclotron was mainly aimed to achieve this goal. Early experiments in nuclear spectroscopy were done with radioactive nuclei with the help of beta and gamma ray spectrometers. Small NaI(Tl) detectors were used for gamma–gamma coincidence, angular correlation and life time measurements. The excited states nuclear magnetic moments were measured in perturbed gamma–gamma angular correlation experiments. A high transmission magnetic beta ray spectrometer was used to measure internal conversion coefﬁcients and beta–gamma coincidence studies. A large number of signiﬁcant contributions were made during 1950–59 using these facilities. Proton beam in the cyclotron was made available in the late 1950’s and together with 14 MeV neutrons obtained from a C-W generator a large number of short-lived nuclei were investigated during 1960’s and 1970’s. The introduction of high resolution Ge gamma detectors and the improved electronics helped to extend the spectroscopic work which include on-line $(p,p'\gamma)$ and $(p,n\gamma)$ reaction studies. Nuclear spectroscopic studies entered a new phase in the 1980’s with the availability of 40–80 MeV alpha beam from the variable energy cyclotron at VECC, Calcutta. A number of experimental groups were formed in the institute to study nuclear level schemes with $(\alpha,xn\gamma)$ reactions. Initially only two unsuppressed Ge detectors were used for coincidence studies. Later in 1989 ﬁve Ge detectors with a large six segmented NaI(Tl) multiplicitysum detector system were successfully used to select various channels in $(\alpha,xn\gamma)$ reactions. From 1990 to date a variety of medium energy heavy ions were made available from the BARC-TIFR Pelletron and the Nuclear Science Centre Pelletron. The state of the art gamma detector arrays in these centres enabled the Saha Institute groups to undertake more sophisticated experiments. Front line nuclear spectroscopy works are now being done and new informations are obtained for a large number of nuclei over a wide mass range. Currently Saha Institute is building a multi-element gamma heavy ion neutron array detector (MEGHNAD), which will have six high efﬁciency clover Ge detector together with charged particle ball and other accessories. The system is expected to be usable in 2002 and will be used in experiments using high energy heavy ions from VECC.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Radioactive beams obtained via fragmentation of the projectile on a primary target have shown to be a powerful tool to produce exotic nuclei and some typical results obtained at GANIL in this area will be shown. To go further, and in particular , to get beams of exotic nuclei, new facilities have been developed recently. The physics expected from the use of these radioactive ion beam facilities is extremely ambitious as stated in the scientiﬁc motivations justifying their construction. At GANIL the SPIRAL facility is ready and will hopefully deliver the ﬁrst radioactive beams in 2001. New experimental devices have been developed to fully exploit the potentiality expected from SPIRAL. EXOGAM is a new, efﬁcient and powerful gamma ray spectrometer currently under installation at GANIL. The design and the performances expected from this array will be discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In-beam gamma-ray spectroscopy, carried out at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in the recent past, using heavy-ion projectiles from the pelletron accelerator centres in the country and multi-detector arrays have yielded signiﬁcant data on the structure of a large number of nuclei spanning different mass regions. The experiments included the study of two-fold $\gamma\gamma$-coincidence events for establishing decay schemes, directional correlation of oriented nuclei (DCO) for help in spin assignments and Doppler shift attenuation for lifetime information. The studies have led to the observation of rotational sequences of states in nuclei near closed shell in the mass $A = 110$ region, vibrational spectra in nuclei with $A\sim 60$, interplay between single-particle and collective modes of excitation in the doubly-odd bromine isotopes, decoupled bands with large quadrupole deformation in $^{77}$Br, shape transition with rotational frequency within a band in $^{138}$Pm and octupole collectivity in $^{153}$Eu. Particle-rotor-model and cranked-shell-model calculations have been carried out to provide an understanding of the underlying nuclear structure</p>

				<title>Spallation reactions studied with $4\pi$-detector arrays</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0067-0073</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recently there has been a renewed interest in the study of spallation reactions in basic nuclear physics as well as in potential applications. Spallation reactions induced by light projectiles (protons, antiprotons, pions, etc.) in the GeV range allow the formation of hot nuclei which do not suffer the collective excitations (compression, rotation, deformation) unavoidable when using massive projectiles. Such nuclei provide an ideal testbench for probing their decay as a function of excitation energy. In these investigations, $4\pi$-detector arrays for charged particles and neutrons play a major role in the event-by-event sorting according to the excitation energy of the nucleus.</p>
					<p>Spallation reactions induced on heavy nuclei allow the conversion of the incident GeV proton into several tens of evaporated neutrons. The neutron production in thick targets has been investigated in great detail thanks to the use of high efﬁciency neutron detector arrays. When scattered on samples of inert or biological materials, these neutrons can be used to study details of the material structure. They could also be utilized for the transmutation of long-lived nuclear wastes or for the feeding of sub-critical nuclear reactors.</p>
					<p>The role of different types of multi-detector arrays is highlighted in this paper. Several references are also given for different uses of high efﬁciency neutron detectors in other contexts.</p>

				<title>The leak microstructure</title>
				<feature>Others</feature>
				<page>0115-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The capabilities of a new microstructure, anode point based, for the detection of gas ionizing radiations are presented. For every single detected ionizing radiation it gives a pair of ‘induced’ charges (anodic and cathodic) of the same amount (pulses of the same amplitudes), of opposite sign, with the same collection time and essentially in time coincidence, that are proportional to the primary ionization collected. Each pulse of a pair gives the same energy and timing information, thus one can be used for these information and the other for the position. The complete lack of insulating materials in the active volume of this microstructure avoids problems of charging-up and makes stable and repeatable its behavior. It is possible to observe primary avalanches with a size of more than $2.5 \times  10^{7}$  electrons (4 pC), which give current pulses with a peak of more than 0.26 mA on 100 Ohm and about 30 ns duration, with 5.9 KeV X-rays of $^{55}$Fe working in proportional region in 760 Torr of isobutane gas. Single electrons emitted by a heated ﬁlament $(E_{c} &lt; 1~{\rm eV})$ can also be detected in 760 Torr of isobutane; with an estimated gas gain of $1.2 \times 10^{6}$ and a counting rate up to 800 Kpulses/sec per single microstructure. Some new features and three different types of sensitive-position two-dimensional read-out detectors based on these microstructures, which are in developmental stage, are presented.</p>

					<p>In the coming decade, the expanding ﬁeld of experimental nuclear physics in our country is going to see a quantum leap in research and developmental activities with new accelerator facilities like the variable energy cyclotron with ECR heavy ion source, the upcoming K-500 superconducting cyclotron, both at VECC, Calcutta, and the superconducting linac boosters at both the Pelletron Accelerator Facilities at TIFR, Mumbai and NSC, New Delhi. When heavy ion beam available from such machines fall on a target and undergo collision, very rich and often pristine ﬁelds of research open up. In order to carry on such activities, we have taken up a project to build a multi element gamma, heavy ion and neutron array of detectors (MEGHNAD) to detect and study the properties of a wide variety of particles like neutrons, protons, light mass clusters, massive ejected fragments, and gamma rays with good solid angle coverage and efﬁciency. Design of the detector array, performance of the prototype detector and brief outline of the research programme to be undertaken with the detector array will be discussed.</p>

In $^{97}$Mo, the ground state level sequence has been extended to $\simeq 4.5$ MeV while the previous information had been up to 2.4 MeV. A negative parity band built on 1437 keV $(11/2^{-})$ excited state has been extended to 5.5 MeV. The structure seems to show a coexistence of single particle and collective modes of excitation.

In the present work, particle-rotor-model calculations have been performed for the $\pi h_{11/2}$ band, using an axially symmetric deformed Nilsson potential.

				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0191-0194</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lifetimes of high spin states up to $I^{\pi}=22^{+}$ in the yrast positive parity bands have been measured to investigate the shape evolution with increasing spin in $^{72,74}$Se. The $Q_{\text{t}}$ values derived from these measurements indicate that prolate shape stabilizes for $^{72}$Se, while a triaxial shape develops for $^{74}$Se at higher spins. Comparison of the observed trend in $Q_{\text{t}}$ with spin for $^{72,74}$Se with that of the corresponding kryptones isotones emphasizes the stability provided by $N = 38$ prolate shell gap even at high rotational frequency.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fusion cross-sections for the $^{7}{\rm Li} + {}^{12}{\rm C}$ reaction have been measured at energies above the Coulomb barrier by the direct detection of evaporation residues. The heavy evaporation residues with energies below 3 MeV could not be separated out from the $\alpha$-particles in the spectrum and hence their contribution was estimated using statistical model calculations. The present work indicates that suppression of fusion cross-sections due to the breakup of $^{7}$Li may not be signiﬁcant for $^{7}{\rm Li} + {}^{12}{\rm C}$ reaction at energies around the barrier.</p>

The RMS consists of a quadrupole doublet just after the target chamber followed by an ‘electrostatic deﬂector’, a magnetic dipole and a second electrostatic deﬂector. The recoils produced in the $^{12}{\rm C} + {}^{58}{\rm Ni}$ reaction using 60 MeV $^{12}$C beam were focussed with the help of electric and magnetic ﬁelds and detected in a strip detector placed at the focal plane of the RMS. Further testing of the spectrometer to obtain mass resolution and efﬁciency are in progress.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0235-0249</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The production of single photons in Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS as measured by the WA98 experiment is analysed. A quark gluon plasma is assumed to be formed initially, which expands, cools, hadronizes, and undergoes freeze-out. A rich hadronic equation of state is used and the transverse expansion of the interacting system is taken into account. The recent estimates of photon production in quark-matter (at two loop level) along with the dominant reactions in the hadronic matter leading to photons are used. About half of the radiated photons are seen to have a thermal origin. The same treatment and the initial conditions provide a very good description to hadronic spectra measured by several groups and the intermediate mass dileptons measured by the NA50 experiment, lending a strong support to the conclusion that quark gluon plasma has been formed in these collisions. Predictions for RHIC and LHC energies are also given.</p>

					<p>Rather than regarding the restriction of current lattice QCD simulations to quark masses that are 5–10 times larger than those observed as a problem, we note that this presents a wonderful opportunity to deepen our understanding of QCD. Just as it has been possible to learn a great deal about QCD by treating $N_{c}$ as a variable, so the study of hadron properties as a function of quark mass is leading us to a deeper appreciation of hadron structure. As examples we cite progress in using the chiral properties of QCD to connect hadron masses, magnetic moments, charge radii and structure functions calculated at large quark masses within lattice QCD with the values observed physically.</p>

A scaling of charged particle multiplicity as $N^{1.07\pm 0:05}_{\text{part}}$ and photons as $N^{1.12\pm 0:03}_{\text{part}}$ have been observed, indicating violation of naive wounded nucleon model. The analysis of localized charged-neutral ﬂuctuation indicates a model-independent demonstration of non-statistical ﬂuctuations in both charged particles and photons in limited azimuthal regions.

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0301-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A systematic analysis of the multifragmentation (MF) in fully reconstructed events from $1A$ GeV Au, La and Kr collisions with C has been performed. Detailed comparisons of the various fragment properties are presented as a function of excitation energy, $E^{\ast}_{\text{th}}$. The charged particle multiplicity from MF stage shows a saturation beyond $E^{\ast}_{\text{th}}\sim 8$ MeV/nucleon for Kr. The universal behavior of intermediate mass fragment yields and of the size of the largest fragment is observed only for Au and La when scaled with size of the system. The Kr data are found to lack this property. Moments of the fragment size distribution show that the Kr MF is different than the MF of Au and La. A power law behavior is observed for Au and La with exponent $\tau &gt;  2$, while for Kr $\tau&lt; 2$. The results are compared with the statistical multifragmentation model (SMM). A single value of all the parameters of the model ﬁts the data for all the three systems. The breakup of Au and La is consistent with a continuous phase transition. The data indicate that both $E^{\ast}_{\text{th}}$ and the isotope ratio temperature $T_{\text{He}-\text{DT}}$ decrease with increase in system size at the critical point. The breakup temperature obtained from SMM also shows the same trend as seen in data. This trend is attributed primarily to the increasing Coulomb energy with ﬁnite size effects playing a smaller role. The percolation and Ising model studies for ﬁnite size neutral matter show behavior which is opposite to the one seen in the present work.</p>

				<title>Quark matter formation in dense stellar objects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0325-0335</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is expected that at very large densities and/or temperatures a quark-hadron phase transition takes place. Lattice QCD calculations at zero baryon density indicate that the transition occurs at $T_{c}\sim 150-170$ MeV. The transition is likely to be second order or a cross over phenomenon. Although not much is known about the density at which the phase transition takes place at small temperatures, it is expected to occur around the nuclear densities of few times nuclear matter density. Also, there is a strong reason to believe that the quark matter formed after the phase transition is in colour superconducting phase. The matter densities in the interior of neutron stars being larger than the nuclear matter density, the neutron star cores may possibly consist of quark matter which may be formed during the collapse of supernova. Starting with the assumption that the quark matter, when formed consists of predominantly $u$ and $d$ quarks, we consider the evolution of $s$ quarks by weak interactions in the present work. The reaction rates and time required to reach the chemical equilibrium are computed here. Our calculations show that the chemical equilibrium is reached in about $10^{-7}$ seconds. Further more during the equilibration process enormous amont of energy is released and copious numbers of neutrinos are produced. Implications of these on the evolution of supernovae will be discussed.</p>

To get the EOS, we have used Brueckner–Bethe–Golstone formalism with Bonn-$B$ potential as two-body interaction and QCD sum rule and Brown–Rho scaling prescriptions for modiﬁcation of hadron parameters. We ﬁnd that EOS is very much sensitive to the meson parameters. We can ﬁt, with two body interaction alone, both the saturation density and the binding energy per nucleon.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The PHENIX experiment consists of a large detector system located at the newly commissioned relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The primary goal of the PHENIX experiment is to look for signatures of the QCD prediction of a deconﬁned high-energy-density phase of nuclear matter quark gluon plasma. PHENIX started data taking for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130$ GeV in June 2000. The signals from the beam-beam counter (BBC) and zero degree calorimeter (ZDC) are used to determine the centrality of the collision. A Glauber model reproduces the ZDC spectrum reasonably well to determine the participants in a collision. Charged particle multiplicity distribution from the ﬁrst PHENIX paper is compared with the other RHIC experiment and the CERN, SPS results. Transverse momentum of photons are measured in the electro-magnetic calorimeter (EMCal) and preliminary results are presented. Particle identiﬁcation is made by a time of ﬂight (TOF) detector and the results show clear separation of the charged hadrons from each other.</p>

				<title>Nuclear and hadronic reaction mechanisms producing spin asymmetry</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0379-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We brieﬂy review concept of the quark recombination (QRC) model and a general success of the model. To solve the existing problem, so called anomalous spin observables, in the high energy hyperon spin phenomena, we propose a mechanism; the primarily produced quarks, which are predominantly $u$ and $d$ quarks, act as the leading partons to form the hyperons. Extension of the quark recombination concept with this mechanism is successful in providing a good account of the anomalous spin observables. Another kind of anomaly, the non-zero analysing power and spin depolarization in the $\Lambda$ hyperon productions, are also discussed and well understood by the presently proposed mechanism. Recently, a further difﬁculty was observed in an exclusive $\Lambda K^{+} p$ production and we will indicate a possible diagram for resolving it.</p>

				<title>Parametrization of nuclear parton distributions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0445-0457</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optimum nuclear parton distributions are obtained by analysing available experimental data on electron and muon deep inelastic scattering (DIS). The distributions are given at $Q^{2} = 1$ GeV$^{2}$ with a number of parameters, which are determined by a $\chi^{2}$ analysis of the data. Valencequark distributions are relatively well determined at medium $x$, but they are slightly dependent on the assumed parametrization form particularly at small $x$. Although antiquark distributions are shadowed at small $x$, their behavior is not obvious at medium $x$ from the $F_{2}$ data. The gluon distributions could not be restricted well by the inclusive DIS data; however, the analysis tends to support the gluon shadowing at small $x$. We provide analytical expressions and computer subroutines for calculating the nuclear parton distributions, so that other researchers could use them for applications to other high-energy nuclear reactions.</p>

The QMFT is a complete theory of cold nuclear phenomena, namely, the cold ﬁssion, cold fusion and cluster radioactivity. Also, the structure calculations based on the axially deformed relativistic mean ﬁeld (DRMF) approach are presented which predict new regions of spherical magicity, namely $Z = 120$ and $N = 172$ or 184, for superheavy nuclei. This result is discussed in the light of recent experiments reporting the cold synthesis of $Z = 118$ element.</p>

				<title>E1 resonances in neutron-rich nuclei within the phonon damping model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0505-0518</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The quasiparticle representation of the phonon damping model (PDM) is developed to include the superfluid pairing correlations microscopically. The formalism is applied to calculate the photoabsorption and the electromagnetic (EM) differential cross sections of E1 excitations in neutron-rich oxygen and calcium isotopes. The calculated photoabsorption cross sections agree reasonably well with the available data for $^{16,18}$O and $^{40,48}$Ca. The results of calculations show that the change of the fraction of the E1 integrated strength in the region of pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) as a function of mass number $A$ with increasing neutron number $N$ is in agreement with the recent experimental data, and does not follow the prediction by the simple cluster model. The EM differential cross sections obtained within PDM in this work show prominent PDR peaks below 15 MeV for $^{20,22}$O in agreement with the recent experimental observation. It is also shown that, using low-energy RI beams at around 50-60 MeV/nucleon, one can observe clean and even enhanced PDR peaks without the admixture with the GDR in the EM differential cross sections of neutron-rich nuclei.</p>

					<p>The essential aspect of contemporary physics is to understand properties of nucleonic matter that constitutes the world around us. Over the years research in nuclear physics has provided strong guidance in understanding the basic principles of nuclear interactions. But, the scenario of nuclear physics changed drastically as the new generation of accelerators started providing more and more rare isotopes, which are away from the line of stability. These weakly bound nuclei are found to exhibit new forms of nuclear matter and unprecedented exotic behaviour. The low breakup thresholds of these rare nuclei are posing new challenges to both theory and experiments. Fortunately, nature has provided a few loosely bound stable nuclei that have been studied thoroughly for decades. Attempts are being made to ﬁnd a consistent picture for the unstable nuclei starting from their stable counterparts. Some signiﬁcant differences in the structure and reaction mechanisms are found.</p>

					<p>Coulomb breakup of neutron-rich nuclei around mass $A\sim 20$ has been studied experimentally using secondary beams ($\sim 500$–600 MeV/u) of unstable nuclei produced at GSI. The spectroscopic factor deduced for the neutron occupying $s_{1/2}$ level in $^{15}$C ground state is consistent with the earlier reported value. The data analysis for Coulomb breakup of $^{17}$C shows that most of the cross section yields the $^{16}$C core in its excited state. For $^{17-22}$O, the low-lying E1 strength amounts up to about 12% of the energy weighted dipole sum rule strength depending on neutron excess. The cluster sum rule limit with $^{16}$O as a core is almost exhausted for $^{17,18}$O, while for more neutron rich isotopes the strength with respect to that limit decreases.</p>

In the transition, there is a new universality which we present here, bringing about a relation between dynamics and statistics. We summarize also the role of chaos in thermalization and dissipation in isolated systems like nuclei.

				<title>Recent studies in heavy ion induced ﬁssion reactions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0585-0600</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nuclear ﬁssion process involves large scale shape changes of the nucleus, while it evolves from a nearly spherical conﬁguration to two separated ﬁssion fragments. The dynamics of these shape changes in the nuclear many body system is governed by a strong interplay of the collective and single particle degrees of freedom. With the availability of heavy ion accelerators, there has been an impetus to study the nuclear dynamics through the investigations of nucleus–nucleus collisions involving fusion and ﬁssion process. From the various investigations carried out in the past years, it is now well recognized that there is large scale damping of collective modes in heavy ion induced ﬁssion reactions, which in other words implies that nuclear motion is highly viscous. In recent years, there have been many experimental observations in heavy ion induced ﬁssion reactions at medium bombarding energies, which suggest possible occurrence of various non-equilibrium modes of ﬁssion such as quasi-ﬁssion, fast ﬁssion and pre-equilibrium ﬁssion, where some of the internal degrees of freedom of the nucleus is not fully equilibrated. We have carried out extensive investigations on the ﬁssion fragment angular distributions at near barrier bombarding energies using heavy ﬁssile targets. The measured fragment anisotropies when compared with the standard saddle point model (SSPM) calculations show that for projectile-target systems having zero or low ground state spins, the angular anisotropy exhibits a peak-like behaviour at the sub barrier energies, which cannot be explained by the SSPM calculations. For projectiles or targets with large ground state spins, the anomalous peaking gets washed out due to smearing of the $K$-distribution by the intrinsic entrance channel spins. Recently studies have been carried out on the spin distributions of ﬁssion fragments through the gamma ray multiplicity measurements. The ﬁssion fragments acquire spin mainly from two sources: (i) due to rigid rotation of the nascent fragments at scission and (ii) due to statistical excitation of the spin bearing collective modes in the ﬁssioning nucleus. One of the collective modes – the tilting mode depends on the $K$ quantum number and is responsible for the emission angle dependence of fragment spin. In our studies, we have shown conclusively that the collective statistical spin modes get strongly suppressed for high $K$ values corresponding to large rotational frequencies along the ﬁssion axis. These results bring out the importance of the dynamical effects in the heavy ion induced fusion-ﬁssion reactions. The present article will review the work carried out on the above aspects in heavy ion ﬁssion reactions as well as on the ﬁssion time scales, and some of the recent studies on the mass-energy correlations of ﬁssion fragments at near-barrier bombarding energies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The deformed mean ﬁeld of nuclei exhibits various geometrical and dynamical symmetries which manifest themselves as various types of rotational and decay patterns. Most of the symmetry operations considered so far have been deﬁned for a situation wherein the angular momentum coincides with one of the principal axes and the principal axis cranking may be invoked. New possibilities arise with the observation of rotational features in weakly deformed nuclei and now interpreted as magnetic rotational bands. More than 120 MR bands have now been identiﬁed by ﬁltering the existing data. We present a brief overview of these bands. The total angular momentum vector in such bands is tilted away from the principal axes. Such a situation gives rise to several new possibilities including breaking of chiral symmetry as discussed recently by Frauendorf. We present the outcome of such symmetries and their possible experimental veriﬁcation. Some possible examples of chiral bands are presented.</p>

					<p>The Project SPES (study and production of exotic nuclei) aims at the full design of a facility based on a 100 MeV, 1–30 mA CW proton Linac used for production of ﬁssion fragments from a uranium like-target by means of a neutron converter. Neutron rich ion species are extracted, selected, further ionized at high charge state, isotopically puriﬁed and then accelerated through a superconducting Linac at energies up to 20 MeV/A. SPES represents INFN’s effort in view of the construction of the European next generation ISOL-type facility, which is expected to be operative by 2010. A conceptual design report of such a European facility is being prepared with the support of the European Commission. R&amp;D activities, covering the most critical parts of the facility, have been partially started in the last two years, triggered by the French–Italian feasibility study of an accelerator driven system for waste transmutation.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0639-0650</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The folded tandem ion accelerator (FOTIA) project at BARC has been commissioned. The analysed carbon beams of 40 nA($3^{+}$) and 25 nA($4^{+}$), at terminal voltage of 2.5 MV with ${\rm N}_{2} + {\rm CO}_{2}$ as insulating gas, were obtained. The beams were characterized by performing the Rutherford back scattering (RBS) on gold, tin and iron targets. The beam energy of 12.5 MeV for $^{12}$C$^{4+}$ was consistent with the terminal voltage of 2.5 MV. The N$_{2} + CO$_{2}$ mixture is being replaced by SF$_{6}$ gas in order to achieve 6 MV on the terminal. In this paper, some of the salient features of the FOTIA and its present status are discussed.</p>

					<p>We are in the process of constructing a superconducting linear accelerator (LINAC), to boost the energy of heavy ion beams from the 14UD Pelletron accelerator, at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. The accelerating structures in the LINAC are quarter wave resonators (QWR) coated with lead which is superconducting at liquid helium temperature. With feasibility studies having been completed during the course of the 4th and 5th ﬁve-year plan periods, culminating with the demonstration of beam acceleration using one accelerating module, the construction of the LINAC is now under way.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This is a brief summary of the ISNP2K (International Symposium on Nuclear Physics, 2000). Many interesting works were presented on new developments and perspectives of nuclear physics in the plenary and poster sessions. Subjects discussed are 1) high temperature and high density nuclei, new QGP phases and relativistic HI collisions, 2) new degrees of freedoms studied by medium energy reactions, 3) exotic nuclei with large isospin, large $A$, high $J$ and high $E_{x}$, 4) new dynamical properties of many body nucleon systems, 5) neutrino nuclear physics and neutrons for astroparticle physics, and 6) new accelerators and new applications. ISNP2K with extensive discussions on nuclear physics frontiers at the turning point from 2000 to 2001 provides a good bridge to the new century.</p>

				<title>Statistical constraints on state preparation for a quantum computer</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0683-0687</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum computing algorithms require that the quantum register be initially present in a superposition state. To achieve this, we consider the practical problem of creating a coherent superposition state of several qubits. We show that the constraints of quantum statistics require that the entropy of the system be brought down when several independent qubits are assembled together. In particular, we have: (i) not all initial states are realizable as pure states; (ii) the temperature of the system must be reduced. These factors, in addition to decoherence and sensitivity to errors, must be considered in the implementation of quantum computers.</p>

					<p>The scattering and absorption differential cross sections for nonlinear QED process such as double photon Compton scattering have been measured as a function of independent ﬁnal photon energy. The incident gamma photons are of 0.662 MeV in energy as produced by an 8 Ci$^{137}$Cs radioactive source and thin aluminum foils are used as scatterer. The two simultaneously emitted photons in this process are detected in coincidence using two NaI(T1) scintillation detectors and a slow-fast coincidence set-up of 30 nsec resolving time. The measured values of scattering and absorption differential cross sections agree with theory within experimental estimated error.</p>

					<p>We derive relativistic ﬂuid set of equations for neutrinos and electrons from relativistic Vlasov equations with Fermi weak interaction force. Using these ﬂuid equations, we obtain a dispersion relation describing neutrino beam plasma instability, which is little different from normal dispersion relation of streaming instability. It contains new, nonelectromagnetic, neutrino-plasma (or electroweak) stable and unstable modes also. The growth of the instability is weak for the highly relativistic neutrino ﬂux, but becomes stronger for weakly relativistic neutrino ﬂux in the case of parameters appropriate to the early universe and supernova explosions. However, this mode is dominant only for the beam velocity greater than $0.25c$ and in the other limit electroweak unstable mode takes over.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0763-0774</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the recent results for the surface current density on cylindrical surfaces of arbitrary cross-section producing uniform interior magnetic ﬁeld we propose a method for obtaining solutions of Bean’s critical state model for general cylindrical samples. The method uses the technique of conformal mapping to express the sample surface and the ﬂux-fronts in terms of a set of coefﬁcients that depend on a parameter. The ﬂux-fronts are to be determined by solving a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the coefﬁcients. Retaining only a certain ﬁnite number of leading coefﬁcients we get an approximate solution. The procedure is illustrated by considering two cylindrical samples – one with an elliptical cross-section and the other with a non-elliptical cross-section. The virgin curve and small and large magnetization hysteresis loops for the two samples are obtained.</p>

				<title>Dielectric relaxation phenomena of rigid polar liquid molecules under giga hertz electric ﬁeld</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0775-0793</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dielectric relaxation phenomena of rigid polar liquid molecules chloral and ethyltrichloroacetate $(j)$ in benzene, $n$-hexane and $n$-heptane $(i)$ under 4.2, 9.8 and 24.6 GHz electric ﬁelds at $30^{\circ}$C are studied to show the possible existence of double relaxation times $\tau_{2}$ and $\tau_{1}$ for rotations of the whole and the ﬂexible parts of molecules. The probability of showing double relaxation is more in aliphatic solvents indicating their nonrigidity. The symmetric and asymmetric distribution parameters $\gamma$ and $\delta$ are obtained from $\chi'_{ij}/\chi_{0ij}$ and $\chi''_{ij}/\chi_{0ij}$ at $w_{j}\to 0$ where $\chi'_{ij}$ and $\chi''_{ij}$ are real and imaginary parts of the complex orientational susceptibility $\chi^{\ast}_{ij}$ and $\chi_{0ij}$ is the low frequency susceptibility which is real. $\chi_{ij}$’s are involved with the measured dielectric relative permittivities $\epsilon'_{ij}$, $\epsilon''_{ij}$, $\epsilon_{0ij}$ and $\epsilon_{\infty ij}$ of solutions. The theoretical weighted contributions $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ towards dielectric dispersions by Fröhlich’s method are compared with the experimental ones obtained from the graphical variation of $\chi'_{ij}/\chi_{0ij}$ and $\chi''_{ij}/\chi_{0ij}$ with weight fractions $w_{j}$’s at $w_{j}\to 0$. The measured dipole moments $\mu_{2}$ and $\mu_{1}$ of the whole and the ﬂexible part of a polar molecule in terms of the linear coefﬁcients $\beta$'s of $\chi'_{ij}$’s with $w_{j}$’s and the estimated $\tau_{2}$ and $\tau_{1}$ reveal their associations with aliphatic solvents. The theoretical dipole moments $\mu_{\text{theo}}$’s from the available bond angles and bond moments of the substituent polar groups of the molecules with the estimated $\mu$’s suggest the mesomeric, inductive and electromeric effects in them under GHz electric ﬁeld.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0795-0808</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present theoretical analyses of anisotropic lattice diamagnetism, magnetization due to magnetic ions and carrier spin-polarization in the diluted magnetic semiconductor, Pb$_{1-x}$Eu$_{x}$Te. The lattice diamagnetism results from orbital susceptibility due to inter band effects and spin-orbit contributions. The spin-orbit contribution is found to be dominant. However, both the contributions show pronounced anisotropy. With increase inx, the diamagnetism decreases. We consider contributions from randomly distributed isolated magnetic ions and clusters of pairs and triads for the local moment magnetization. The isolated magnetic-ion contribution is the dominant one. We calculate the magnetization for two typical magnetic ion concentrations: $x = 0.03$ and $x = 0.06$. Temperature dependence of the magnetization is also considered. Apart from lattice and localized magnetic ions, the carrier contribution to the spin-density is also calculated for a carrier density of $p = 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$. The relative spin-density of carriers increases with increase in the magnetic ﬁeld strength and magnetic ion concentration. The agreement with experiment where available is reasonably good.</p>

					<p>Chemical compositions of the alloys of CuNi (Cu$_{0.10}$Ni$_{0.90}$, Cu$_{0.30}$Ni$_{0.70}$, Cu$_{0.70}$Ni$_{0.30}$) and BiSb (Bi$_{0.80}$Sb$_{0.20}$, Bi$_{0.64}$Sb$_{0.34}$, Bi$_{0.55}$Sb$_{0.45}$) are determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The stoichiometries are determined and are compared with the bulk compositions. Possible sources of systematic errors contributing to the results are discussed. Errors arising out of preferential etching in these alloys have been investigated. It has been inferred from such studies that the preferential etching does not enrich the surface composition with a particular component for the two systems reported here. Quantitative results of CuNi system indicate that the surface regions of the Cu$_{0.70}$Ni$_{0.30}$ alloy is Cu-rich, although no such evidence is observed in case of BiSb system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations (CNLS) very often represent wave propagation in optical media such as multicore ﬁbers, photorefractive materials and so on. We consider speciﬁcally the pulse propagation in integrable CNLS equations (generalized Manakov systems). We point out that these systems possess novel exact soliton type pulses which are shape changing under collision leading to an intensity redistribution. The shape changes correspond to linear fractional transformations allowing for the possibility of construction of logic gates and Turing equivalent all optical computers in homogeneous bulk media as shown by Steiglitz recently. Special cases of such solitons correspond to the recently much discussed partially coherent stationary solitons (PCS). In this paper, we review critically the recent developments regarding the above properties with particular reference to 2-CNLS.</p>

				<title>Completely integrable models of nonlinear optics</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0953-0968</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The models of the nonlinear optics in which solitons appeared are considered. These models are of paramount importance in studies of nonlinear wave phenomena. The classical examples of phenomena of this kind are the self-focusing, self-induced transparency and parametric interaction of three waves. At present there are a number of theories based on completely integrable systems of equations, which are, both, generations of the original known models and new ones. The modiﬁed Korteweg-de Vries equation, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation, Sine–Gordon equation, the reduced Maxwell–Bloch equation, Hirota equation, the principal chiral ﬁeld equations, and the equations of massive Thirring model are some soliton equations, which are usually to be found in nonlinear optics theory.</p>

					<p>Switching between the bistable soliton states in a doubly and inhomogeneously doped ﬁber system is studied numerically. Both the cases of lossless as well as lossy couplers are considered. It is shown that both up-switching (from the low state to the high state) and down-switching (from the high state to the low state) of solitons between bistable states are realizable, if the ampliﬁcation of the input soliton for up-switching and the extraction of energy from it for down-switching are suitably adjusted.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we consider nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equations, both in the anomalous and normal dispersive regimes, which govern the propagation of a single ﬁeld in a ﬁber medium with phase modulation and ﬁbre gain (or loss). The integrability conditions are arrived from linear eigen value problem. The variable transformations which connect the integrable form of modiﬁed NLS equations are presented. We succeed in Hirota bilinearzing the equations and on solving, exact bright and dark soliton solutions are obtained. From the results, we show that the soliton is alive, i.e. pulse area can be conserved by the inclusion of gain (or loss) and phase modulation effects.</p>

				<title>Stable helical solitons in optical media</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1061-1078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a review of new results which suggest the existence of fully stable spinning solitons (self-supporting localised objects with an internal vorticity) in optical ﬁbres with self-focusing Kerr (cubic) nonlinearity, and in bulk media featuring a combination of the cubic self-defocusing and quadratic nonlinearities. Their distinctive difference from other optical solitons with an internal vorticity, which were recently studied in various optical media, theoretically and also experimentally, is that all the spinning solitons considered thus far have been found to be unstable against azimuthal perturbations.</p>
					<p>In the ﬁrst part of the paper, we consider solitons in a nonlinear optical ﬁbre in a region of parameters where the ﬁbre carries exactly two distinct modes, viz., the fundamental one and the ﬁrst-order helical mode. From the viewpoint of application to communication systems, this opens the way to doubling the number of channels carried by a ﬁbre. Besides that, these solitons are objects of fundamental interest. To fully examine their stability, it is crucially important to consider collisions between them, and their collisions with fundamental solitons, in (ordinary or hollow) optical ﬁbres. We introduce a system of coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations for the fundamental and helical modes with nonstandard values of the cross-phase-modulation coupling constants, and show, in analytical and numerical forms, results of collisions between solitons carried by the two modes.</p>
					<p>In the second part of the paper, we demonstrate that the interaction of the fundamental beam with its second harmonic in bulk media, in the presence of self-defocusing Kerr nonlinearity, gives rise to the ﬁrst ever example of completely stable spatial ring-shaped solitons with intrinsic vorticity. The stability is demonstrated both by direct simulations and by analysis of linearized equations.</p>

				<page>1097-1127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Multi-terabit/s, ultra-high speed optical transmissions over several thousands kilometers on ﬁbers are becoming a reality. Most use RZ (Return to Zero) format in dispersion-managed ﬁbers. This format is the only stable waveform in the presence of ﬁber Kerr nonlinearity and dispersion in all optical transmission lines with loss compensated by periodic ampliﬁcations. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation assisted by the split step numerical solutions is commonly used as the master equation to describe the information transfer in optical ﬁbers. All these facts are the outcome of research on optical solitons in ﬁbers in spite of the fact that the commonly used RZ format is not always called a soliton format. The overview presented here attempts to incorporate the role of soliton-based communications research in present day ultra-high speed communications.</p>

We work to quadratic order in the gauge ﬁeld strength $F$, but all orders in derivatives. In a certain limit, which requires the presence of a constant $B$-ﬁeld background, it is found that these corrections neatly sum up into the $\ast_{2}$ product of (commutative) gauge ﬁelds.

					<p>It has been a long standing problem to ﬁnd the connection between the realistic nucleon–nucleon interaction and the interaction between two nucleons when they are embedded inside a nuclear medium, the so-called ‘effective interaction’. On the one hand various many-body approaches have been employed, while on the other hand, information is sought on the basis of static nuclear properties. Both provide partial information. An attempt is made to understand if there is an inherent link, a bridge, which connects all these informations, through the study of heavy ion fusion reactions.</p>

				<title>Investigations of low $q_{a}$ discharges in the SINP tokamak</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Low edge safety factor discharges including very low $q_{a} (1 &lt; q_{a} &lt; 2)$ and ultra low $q_{a}$ $(0 &lt; q_{a} &lt; 1)$ have been obtained in the SINP tokamak. It has been observed that accessibility of these discharges depends crucially on the fast rate of plasma current rise. Several interesting results in terms of different time scales like $T_{q_{a}}$, $\tau_{R}$ etc have been obtained using a set of softwares developed at SINP. From ﬂuctuation analysis of the external magnetic probe data it has been found that MHD instabilities $m = 1$, $n = 1$ and $m = 2$, $n = 1$ etc. play major role in the evolution of these discharges. To investigate the internal details of these discharges, an internal magnetic probe system has been developed using which current density $j_{\phi}$ and other related parameters have been estimated. By carrying out a resistive stability analysis, evidence of the above-mentioned MHD instabilities have again been found. The physical processes lying behind the accessibility and evolution of the low $q_{a}$ discharges have been thoroughly investigated.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0091-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Compton proﬁles of momentum distribution of conduction electrons in the orthorhombic phase of $\alpha$-Ga metal at low temperature are calculated in the band model for the three crystallographic directions (100), (010), and (001). Unlike the results at room temperature, previously reported by Lengeler, Lasser and Mair, the present results show strong anisotropy in the Compton proﬁles with the momentum distribution along (001) direction being substantially different from the other two directions. While experimental data on Compton proﬁles at low temperatures are not available for comparison with theory, the resistivity data in $\alpha$-Ga at low temperature strongly support this anisotropic behaviour. Besides, the electronic heat capacity constant $\gamma$ available from both experiment and present calculation suggests that the conduction electron distribution at low temperature in the orthorhombic phase is markedly different from the free-electron-like-distribution at room temperature, thus lending additional support to anisotropic behaviour of Compton proﬁles. It would be nice to have Compton proﬁles data from experiment at low temperature for direct comparison with theory. It is hoped that the present work would stimulate enough interest in that direction.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0101-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photo-EPR measurements carried out on Nd$^{3+}$ -doped polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) ﬁlms have shown that nearly 100% reduction occurs in the intensity of EPR of Nd$^{3+}$ under in situ copper vapor laser (CVL) illumination (510.5 nm and 578.2 nm). The kinetics of decay and recovery were investigated. Photoacoustic (PA) spectra, observed under CVL pump condition had shown that the CVL induced changes were not due to photoinduced valence change, and that the CVL pumping creates highly favorable conditions for non-equilibrium population distribution in the excited electronic states. The complete disappearance of EPR under CVL pumping is attributed either to the possible equalization of population of $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ Zeeman components, through the decay of many excited states in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld or conﬁgurational changes around Nd$^{3+}$ shifting the resonance frequency. The former appears less probable in view of the relatively slower recovery of EPR signal.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have analysed the solar neutrino data obtained from chlorine, gallium and Super-Kamiokande (SK) experiments (1258 days) and also the new results that came from Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) charge current (CC) and elastic scattering (ES) experiments considering that the solar neutrino deﬁcit is due to the interaction of neutrino transition magnetic moment with the solar magnetic ﬁeld. We have also analysed the moments of the spectrum of scattered electrons at SK. Another new feature in the analysis is that for the global analysis, we have replaced the spectrum by its centroid.</p>

				<title>Theory of non-hermitian localization in one dimension: Localization length and eigenenergies</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0155-0172</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We recall some basic aspects of the pinning of ﬂux lines in a superconducting cylindrical shell subjected to a depinning magnetic ﬁeld, as well as its description by the quantum mechanics of a disordered ring with an imaginary vector potential proportional to the depinning ﬁeld (N Hatano and D R Nelson, Phys. Rev. \textbf{B56}, 8651 (1997)). We then discuss our recent analysis of the pinning-depinning transition in terms of an explicit solution for the inverse localization length of the eigenstates of the non-hermitian quantum system for weak disorder. Our results as to the nature of the non hermitian quantum states, differ qualitatively from earlier studies which did not examine the detailed properties of the localization length. Nevertheless we obtain a well-deﬁned simple picture for the pinning-depinning transition of ﬂux lines. We discuss furthermore a new exact calculation of localized state eigenenergies for weak disorder, which we compare with previous analytic and numerical results.</p>

				<title>Effect of quantum entanglement on Aharonov–Bohm oscillations, spin-polarized transport and current magniﬁcation effect</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0173-0181</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a simple model of transmission across a metallic mesoscopic ring. In one of its arm an electron interacts with a single magnetic impurity via an exchange coupling. We show that entanglement between electron and spin impurity states leads to reduction of Aharonov–Bohm oscillations in the transmission coefﬁcient. The spin-conductance is asymmetric in the ﬂux reversal as opposed to the two-probe electrical conductance which is symmetric. In the same model, in contradiction to the naive expectation of a current magniﬁcation effect, we observe enhancement as well as suppression of this effect depending on the system parameters. The limitations of this model to the general notion of dephasing or decoherence in quantum systems are pointed out.</p>

				<title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking by ac ﬁeld: Effect of commensurability in the frequency domain</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0183-0193</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is shown that the variance of the linear dc conductance ﬂuctuations in an open quantum dot under high-frequency ac pumping depends signiﬁcantly on the spectral content of the ac ﬁeld. For a sufﬁciently strong ac ﬁeld the dc conductance ﬂuctuations are much stronger for the periodic pumping than in the case of the noise ac ﬁeld of the same intensity. The reduction factor $r$ in a static magnetic ﬁeld takes the universal value of 2 only for the white-noise pumping. In general $r$ may deviate from 2 thus signalling on the time-reversal breaking by the ac ﬁeld. For the bi-harmonic ac ﬁeld of the form $A(t) = A_{0} [\cos(\omega_{1} t) + cos(\omega_{2} t)]$ we predict the enchancement of effects of $T$-symmetry breaking at commensurate frequencies $\omega_{2}/\omega_{1} = P/Q$. In the high-temperature limit there is also the parity effect: the enchancement is only present if either $P$ or $Q$ is even.</p>

					<p>We numerically study the effect of non-symmetry dictated nodes (NSDN) on electron correlation effects for spinless electrons. We ﬁnd that repulsive interaction between electrons can enhance the overlap between nearest neighbors in the tight binding Hamiltonian, in the presence of NSDN. Normally, in the absence of NSDN, attractive interaction between electrons give such an effect and repulsive interaction gives the opposite effect.</p>

				<title>Parity effects in eigenvalue correlators, parametric and crossover correlators in random matrix models: Application to mesoscopic systems</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0217-0224</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper summarizes some work that I have been doing on eigenvalue correlators of random matrix models which show some interesting behavior. First we consider matrix models with gaps in their spectrum or density of eigenvalues. The density–density correlators of these models depend on whether $N$, where $N$ is the size of the matrix, takes even or odd values. The fact that this dependence persists in the large $N$ thermodynamic limit is an unusual property and may have consequences in the study of one electron effects in mesoscopic systems. Secondly, we study the parametric and cross correlators of the Harish Chandra–Itzykson–Zuber matrix model. The analytic expressions determine how the correlators change as a parameter (e.g. the strength of a perturbation in the Hamiltonian of the chaotic system or external magnetic ﬁeld on a sample of material) is varied. The results are relevant for the conductance ﬂuctuations in disordered mesoscopic systems.</p>

				<title>Role of mesoscopic morphology in charge transport of doped polyaniline</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0233-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In doped polyaniline (PANI), the charge transport properties are determined by mesoscopic morphology, which in turn is controlled by the molecular recognition interactions among polymer chain, dopant and solvent. Molecular recognition plays a signiﬁcant role in chain conformation and charge delocalization. The resistivity of PANI doped by camphor sulfonic acid (CSA)/2-acrylo-amido-1-propane sulfonic acid (AMPSA)/dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) is around 0.02 $\Omega$ cm. PANI-CSA and PANI-AMPSA show a metallic positive temperature coefﬁcient of resistivity above 150 K, with a ﬁnite value of conductivity at 1.4 K; whereas, PANI-DBSA shows hopping transport at low temperatures. The magnetoresistance is positive (negative) for PANI-CSA (PANIAMPSA); and PANI-DBSA has a large positive MR. The behavior of MR suggests subtle variations in mesoscopic morphology between PANI-CSA and PANI-AMPSA.</p>

				<title>Charge densities and charge noise in mesoscopic conductors</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0241-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We introduce a hierarchy of density of states to characterize the charge distribution in a mesoscopic conductor. At the bottom of this hierarchy are the partial density of states which represent the contribution to the local density of states if both the incident and the out-going scattering channel is prescribed. The partial density of states play a prominent role in measurements with a scanning tunneling microscope on multiprobe conductors in the presence of current ﬂow. The partial density of states determine the degree of dephasing generated by a weakly coupled voltage probe. In addition the partial density of states determine the frequency-dependent response of mesoscopic conductors in the presence of slowly oscillating voltages applied to the contacts of the sample. The partial density of states permit the formulation of a Friedel sum rule which can be applied locally. We introduce the off-diagonal elements of the partial density of states matrix to describe charge ﬂuctuation processes. This generalization leads to a local Wigner–Smith life-time matrix.</p>

					<p>The quantum-classical crossover from the Fermi liquid towards the Wigner solid is numerically revisited using small square lattice models where electrons interact via a Coulomb $U/r$ potential. From exact numerical diagonalizations, one ﬁnds that the mesoscopic electron solid is formed in two stages, giving rise to an intriguing solid–liquid regime at intermediate couplings. The roles of a random substrate and of the spin degrees of freedom are investigated.

				<title>Mesoscopic effects in the quantum Hall regime</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0271-0283</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report results of a study of (integer) quantum Hall transitions in a single or multiple Landau levels for non-interacting electrons in disordered two-dimensional systems, obtained by projecting a tight-binding Hamiltonian to the corresponding magnetic subbands. In ﬁnite-size systems, we ﬁnd that mesoscopic effects often dominate, leading to apparent non-universal scaling behavior in higher Landau levels. This is because localization length, which grows exponentially with Landau level index, exceeds the system sizes amenable to the numerical study at present. When band mixing between multiple Landau levels is present, mesoscopic effects cause a crossover from a sequence of quantum Hall transitions for weak disorder to classical behavior for strong disorder. This behavior may be of relevance to experimentally observed transitions between quantum Hall states and the insulating phase at low magnetic ﬁelds.</p>

					<p>We discuss the possibility of spin-glass order in the vicinity of the unexpected metallic state of the two-dimensional electron gas in zero applied magnetic ﬁeld. An average ferromagnetic moment may also be present, and the spin-glass order then resides in the plane orthogonal to the ferromagnetic moment. We argue that a quantum transition involving the destruction of the spin-glass order in an applied in-plane magnetic ﬁeld offers a natural explanation of some features of recent magnetoconductance measurements. We present a quantum ﬁeld theory for such a transition and compute its mean ﬁeld properties.</p>

Using these tight binding Hamiltonians and spin resolved Landauer–Büttiker formula, spin and charge transport is studied. Speciﬁcally numerical results are presented for a new method to perform magnetic scanning tunneling microscopy with non-magnetic tip but in the presence of Elliot–Yafet SO interaction. The spin relaxation phenomena in two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of Rashba SO interaction are studied and contrary to naive expectation, it is shown that disorder helps to reduce spin relaxation.</p>

				<title>Wave scattering through classically chaotic cavities in the presence of absorption: A maximum-entropy model</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0325-0331</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a maximum-entropy model for the transport of waves through a classically chaotic cavity in the presence of absorption. The entropy of the $S$-matrix statistical distribution is maximized, with the constraint $\langle {\rm Tr}SS^{\dagger}\rangle = \alpha n: n$ is the dimensionality of $S$, and $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$. For $\alpha = 1$ the $S$-matrix distribution concentrates on the unitarity sphere and we have no absorption; for $\alpha = 0$ the distribution becomes a delta function at the origin and we have complete absorption. For strong absorption our result agrees with a number of analytical calculations already given in the literature. In that limit, the distribution of the individual (angular) transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients becomes exponential – Rayleigh statistics – even for $n = 1$. For $n\gg 1$ Rayleigh statistics is attained even with no absorption; here we extend the study to $\alpha &lt; 1$. The model is compared with random-matrix-theory numerical simulations: it describes the problem very well for strong absorption, but fails for moderate and weak absorptions. The success of the model for strong absorption is understood in the light of a central-limit theorem. For weak absorption, some important physical constraint is missing in the construction of the model.</p>

					<p>We study the statistics of the experimental eigenfunctions of chaotic and disordered microwave billiards in terms of the moments of their spatial distributions, such as the inverse participation ratio (IPR) and density-density auto-correlation. A path from chaos to disorder is described in terms of increasing IPR. In the chaotic, ballistic limit, the data correspond well with universal results from random matrix theory. Deviations from universal distributions are observed due to disorder induced localization, and for the weakly disordered case the data are well-described by including ﬁnite conductance and mean free path contributions in the framework of nonlinear sigma models of supersymmetry.</p>

				<title>Flicker noise in degenerately doped Si single crystals near the metal–insulator transition</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0343-0359</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we report some of the important results of experimental investigations of the ﬂicker noise near the metal–insulator (MI) transition in doped silicon single crystals. This is the ﬁrst comprehensive work to study low-frequency noise in heavily doped Si over an extensive temperature range (2 K $&lt; T &lt; 500$ K). The measurements of conductance ﬂuctuations (ﬂicker noise) were carried out in the frequency range $10^{-2}&lt; f &lt; 4\times 10^{1}$ Hz in single crystalline Si across the MI transition by doping with phosphorous and boron. The magnitude of noise in heavily doped Si is much larger than that seen in lightly doped Si over the whole temperature range. The extensive temperature range covered allowed us to detect two distinct noise mechanisms. At low temperatures ($T &lt; 100$ K) universal conductance ﬂuctuations (UCF) dominate and the spectral dependence of the noise is determined by dephasing the electron from defects with two-levels (TLS). At higher temperatures ($T &gt; 200$ K) the noise arises from activated defect dynamics. As the MI transition is approached, the $1/f$ spectral power, typical of the metallic regime, gets modiﬁed by the presence of discrete Lorentzians which arise from generation-recombination process which is the characteristic of a semiconductor.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Non-resonant microwave absorption (NRMA) studies of superconducting MgB$_{2}$ and a sample containing $\sim 10\%$ by weight of MgO in MgB$_{2}$ are reported. The NRMA results indicate near absence of intergranular weak links in the pure MgB$_{2}$ sample. A linear temperature dependence of the lower critical ﬁeld $H_{\text{c}1}$ is observed indicating a non-$s$ wave superconductivity. However, the phase reversal of the NRMA signal which could suggest $d$ wave symmetry is also not observed. In the MgB$_{2}$ + MgO sample, much larger low ﬁeld dependent absorption is observed indicating the presence of intergranular weak links. The hysteretic behavior of NRMA is compared and contrasted in the two samples. In the pure MgB$_{2}$ sample, a large hysteresis is observed between the forward and the reverse scans of the magnetic ﬁeld indicating strong pinning of ﬂux lines. This hysteresis saturates a few degrees below $T_{\text{c}}$ while in the MgB$_{2}$ + MgO sample, a much slower increase of hysteresis with decreasing temperature is observed, a signature of weaker pinning.</p>

Core-shell Pd–Ni particles with composition, Pd$_{561}$Ni$_{3000}$, (diameter $\sim 3.3$ nm) are superparamagnetic at 5 K and organize themselves into two-dimensional crystalline arrays. Similar arrays are obtained with Pd$_{561}$Ni$_{3000}$Pd$_{1500}$ nanoparticles containing an additional Pd shell. Magnetic spinel particles of $\gamma$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$, Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$ and CoFe$_{2}$O$_{4}$ of average diameters in the 4–6 nm range coated with octylamine are all supermagnetic at room temperature and yield close-packed disordered arrays. Relatively regular arrays are formed by dodecylamine-capped Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$ nanoparticles ($\sim 8.6$ nm diameter) while well-ordered hexagonal arrays were obtained with octylamine-covered Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$ nanoparticles ($\sim 4.2$ nm diameter).</p>

The dynamical equations are of the canonical form for the two conjugate variables, and the Hamiltonian corresponds to that of a momentum-shortened pendulum, supporting a richer set of tunneling oscillation modes than for a superconductor Josephson junction, that has a ﬁxed-length pendulum as a mechanical model. Novel modes include ‘inverted pendulum’ oscillations with an average angle of $\pi$; and oscillations about a self-maintained population imbalance that we term ‘macroscopic quantum self-trapping’. Other systems with this phase-number nonlinear dynamics include two-component (interconverting) condensates in a single harmonic trap, and He$^{3}B superﬂuids in two containers connected by micropores.</p>

				<title>Locating the minimum: Approach to equilibrium in a disordered, symmetric zero range process</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0409-0417</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We consider the dynamics of the disordered, one-dimensional, symmetric zero range process in which a particle from an occupied site $k$ hops to its nearest neighbor with a quenched rate $w(k)$. These rates are chosen randomly from the probability distribution $f (w) \sim (w - c)^{n}$, where $c$ is the lower cutoff. For $n &gt; 0$, this model is known to exhibit a phase transition in the steady state from a low density phase with a ﬁnite number of particles at each site to a high density aggregate phase in which the site with the lowest hopping rate supports an inﬁnite number of particles. In the latter case, it is interesting to ask how the system locates the site with globally minimum rate. We use an argument based on the local equilibrium, supported by Monte Carlo simulations, to describe the approach to the steady state. We ﬁnd that at large enough time, regions with a smooth density proﬁle are described by a diffusion equation with site-dependent rates, while the isolated points where the mass distribution is singular act as the boundaries of these regions. Our argument implies that the relaxation time scales with the system size $L$ as $L^{z}$ with $z = 2+ 1/(n+ 1)$ for $n &gt; 1$ and suggests a different behavior for $n &lt; 1$.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0419-0426</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article reviews some effects of disorder in percolation systems away from the critical density $p_{c}$. For densities below $p_{c}$, the statistics of large clusters deﬁnes the animals problem. Its relation to the directed animals problem and the Lee–Yang edge singularity problem is described. Rare compact clusters give rise to Grifﬁths singularities in the free energy of diluted ferromagnets, and lead to a very slow relaxation of magnetization. In biased diffusion on percolation clusters, trapping in dead-end branches leads to asymptotic drift velocity becoming zero for strong bias, and very slow relaxation of velocity near the critical bias ﬁeld.</p>

				<title>All basic condensed matter physics phenomena and notions mirror in biology – A hypothesis, two examples and a novel prediction</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0427-0437</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A few billion years of evolutionary time and the complex process of ‘selection’ has given biology an opportunity to explore a variety of condensed matter phenomena and situations, some of which have been discovered by humans in the laboratory, that too only in extreme non-biological conditions such as low temperatures, high purity, high pressure etc., in the last centuries. Biology, at some level, is a complex and self-regulated condensed matter system compared to the ‘inanimate’ condensed matter systems such as liquid $^{4}$He, liquid water or a piece of graphite. In this article I propose a hypothesis that ‘all basic condensed matter physics phenomena and notions (already known and ones yet to be discovered) mirror in biology’. I explain this hypothesis by considering the idea of ‘Bose condensation’ or ‘momentum space order’ and discuss two known example of quantum magnetism encountered in biology. I also provide some new and rather speculative possibility, from light harvesting in biological photosynthesis, of mesoscopic exciton condensation related phenomena at room temperature.</p>

				<page>0439-0442</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we present a qualitative outlook of mesoscopic biology where the typical length scale is of the order of nanometers and the energy scales comparable to thermal energy. Novel biomolecular machines, governed by coded information at the level of DNA and proteins, operate at these length scales in biological systems. In recent years advances in technology have led to the study of some of the design principles of these machines; in particular at the level of an individual molecule. For example, the forces that operate in molecular interactions, the stochasticity involved in these interactions and their spatio-temporal dynamics are beginning to be explored. Understanding such design principles is opening new possibilities in mesoscopic physics with potential applications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A base-equation method is implemented to realize the hereditary algebra of the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) hierarchy and the $N$-soliton manifold is reconstructed. The novelty of our approach is that, it can in a rather natural way, predict other nonlinear evolution equations which admit local conservation laws. Signiﬁcantly enough, base functions themselves are found to provide a basis to regard the KdV-like equations as higher order degenerate bi-Lagrangian systems.</p>

					<p>One-soliton solutions of axially symmetric vacuum Einstein ﬁeld equations are presented in this paper.

An analysis of the solutions in terms of the Ernst potential is also presented. It is found that the solutions do not reduce to the Euclidean form at spatial inﬁnity.

				<page>0489-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The $^{124}$Ba nucleus is investigated on the basis of the method of statistical mechanics by assuming the nucleons to move in triaxially deformed Nilsson potential. The variation in the Fermi energies of protons and neutrons is studied as a function of spin and temperature. The Fermi energies determined as a function of angular momentum is used to study the dependence of shell correction on angular momentum using the Strutinsky smoothing procedure. The most important observation is that the shell correction is almost the same for all spins for $^{124}$Ba. The spin cutoff parameter and the single particle level density parameter are studied as a function of spin and temperature. Constant entropy lines drawn by plotting the excitation energy against angular momentum are found to be roughly at constant energy above the yrast line and are almost equally spaced. It is observed that no yrast traps are present for $^{124}$Ba.</p>

					<p>Development of a new electron-recoil ion/photon coincidence setup for investigating some of the electron induced collision processes, such as electron bremsstrahlung, electron backscattering, innershell excitation and multiple ionization of target atoms/molecules in bombardment of electrons having energies from 2.0 keV to 30.0 keV with solid and gaseous targets is described. The new features include the use of a compact multipurpose scattering chamber, a time-of-ﬂight spectrometer for detection of multiply charged target ions, a $45^{\circ}$-parallel plate electrostatic analyzer for measuring energy and angle of the ejected electrons, a room temperature high resolution Si-PIN photo diode X-ray detector for counting the collisionally induced photons, a coincidence data acquisition system consisting of a 200 MHz Pentium based 8K-multichannel analyzer and a standard network of a fast/slow coincidence electronics. In particular, the details of design, fabrication and assembly of indigenous components employed in the setup are presented. Selected experiments planned with the setup are mentioned and brieﬂy discussed. A report on performance, optimization, efﬁciency, time resolution etc. of the time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectrometer and that of the $45^{\circ}$-parallel plate electrostatic analyzer (PPEA) is presented. Test spectra of electron-recoil ion coincidences, energy distribution of ejected electrons and characteristic plus non-characteristic X-ray spectrum are illustrated to exhibit the satisfactory performance of the developed setup.</p>

These coefﬁcients have been found to depend upon the photon energy following a 4-parameter polynomial. These extinction coefﬁcients for different sugars having the same molecular formula have same values varying within experimental uncertainty. Within concentration ranges studied, Beer–Lambert law is obeyed very well.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>QCD corrections to order $\alpha_{s}$ in the soft-gluon approximation to angular distributions of decay charged leptons in the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to t\overline{t}$, followed by semileptonic decay of $t$ or $\overline{t}$, are obtained in the $e^{+} e^{-}$ centre-of-mass frame. As compared to distributions in the top rest frame, these have the advantage that they would allow direct comparison with experiment without the need to reconstruct the top rest frame. The results also do not depend on the choice of a spin quantization axis for $t$ or $\overline{t}$. Analytic expression for the triple distribution in the polar angle of $t$ and polar and azimuthal angles of the lepton is obtained. Analytic expression is also derived for the distribution in the charged-lepton polar angle. Numerical values are discussed for $\sqrt{s} = 400$, 800 and 1500 GeV.</p>

					<p>Half life for the emission of exotic clusters like $^{8}$Be, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{20}$Ne, $^{24}$Mg and $^{28}$Si are computed taking Coulomb and proximity potentials as interacting barrier and many of these are found well within the present upper limit of measurement. These results lie very close to those values reported by Shanmugam et al using their cubic plus Yukawa plus exponential model (CYEM). It is found that $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O emissions from $^{116}$Ce and $^{16}$O from $^{118}$Ce are most favorable for measurement $(T_{1/2} &lt; 10^{10}{\rm s})$. Lowest half life time for $^{16}$O emission from $^{116}$Ce stress the role of doubly magic $^{100}$Sn daughter in exotic decay. Geiger–Nuttall plots were studied for different clusters and are found to be linear. Inclusion of proximity potential will not produce much deviation to linear nature of Geiger–Nuttall plots. It is observed that neutron excess in the parent nuclei slow down the exotic decay process. These ﬁndings support the earlier observations of Gupta and collaborators using their preformed cluster model (PCM).</p>

					<p>The angular variations of the ﬁve-fold differential cross section obtained by using different wave functions of helium are compared with experimental data. It is found that in the coplanar geometry two kinematical arrangements, (i) equal energy sharing between the two ejected electrons with one of them ejected along the momentum transfer direction and the other along varying direction and (ii) the Bethe ridge condition with ﬁxed sum of ejected electron energies and varying angle between them, are very sensitive to e–e correlations contained in the target wave function. This comparison has been used to show that open-shell class of wave functions better incorporate e–e correlations than the closed-shell class.</p>

				<title>Effect of absorbed pump power on the quality of output beam from monolithic microchip lasers</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0657-0668</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dependence of the beam propagation factor ($M^{2}$ parameter) with the absorbed pump power in the case of monolithic microchip laser under face-cooled conﬁguration is extensively studied. Our investigations show that the $M^{2}$ parameter is related to the absorbed pump power through two parameters ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) whose values depend on the laser material properties and laser conﬁguration. We have shown that one parameter arises due to the oscillation of higher order modes in the microchip cavity and the other parameter accounts for the spherical aberration associated with the thermal lens induced by the pump beam. Such dependency of $M^{2}$ parameter with the absorbed pump power is experimentally veriﬁed for a face-cooled monolithic microchip laser based on Nd$^{3+}$ - doped GdVO$_{4}$ crystal and the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters were estimated from the experimentally measured data points.</p>

					<p>We study the rheology of semi-dilute solutions of the sodium salt of calf-thymus DNA in the linear and nonlinear regimes.

					<p>Densities $\rho$ and ultrasonic speeds $u$ of the binary mixtures of tetrahydrofuran (THF) with 1-butanol and tert-butanol, at $30^{\circ}$C, over the entire composition range were measured. From these data isentropic compressibility, $K_{s}$, intermolecular free length $L_{f}$, relative association $R_{A}$, acoustic impedance $Z$, molar sound speed $R_{m}$, deviations in isentropic compressibility $\Delta K_{s}$, and excess volume $V^{E}$ were calculated. The variation of these parameters with composition of the mixture helps us in understanding the nature and extent of interaction between unlike molecules in the mixtures. Further, theoretical values of ultrasonic speed were evaluated using theories and empirical relations. The relative merits of these theories and relations were discussed.</p>

					<p>Expressions for transverse and longitudinal current–current correlation functions of an ideal Fermi gas describing the current ﬂuctuations induced in the electron system by external probe perpendicular and parallel to the propagation of electron wave, have been obtained at ﬁnite temperature. The results obtained for transverse and longitudinal functions are presented for different values of wavelength and frequency at different temperatures.

				<title>Magnetotransport of the low-carrier density one-dimensional $S=1/2$ antiferromagnet Yb$_{4}$As$_{3}$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0715-0723</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The transport properties of the semimetallic quasi-one-dimensional $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnet Yb$_{4}$As$_{3}$ have been studied by performing low-temperature ($T\geq 0.02$ K) and high magnetic-ﬁeld ($B \leq 60$ T) measurements of the electrical resistivity $\rho(T, B)$. For $T\gtrsim 2$ K a ‘heavy-fermion’-like behavior $\Delta_{\rho}(T) = AT^{2}$ with huge and nearly ﬁeld-independent coefﬁcient $A \approx 3 \mu\Omega$  cm/K$^{2}$ is observed, whereas at lower temperatures $\rho(T)$ deviates from this behavior and slightly increases to the lowest $T$. In $B > 0$ and $T \lesssim 6$ K the resistivity shows an anomalous magnetic-history dependence together with an unusual relaxation behavior. In the isothermal resistivity Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations, arising from a low-density system of mobile As-$4p$ holes, with a frequency of 25 T have been recorded. From the $T$- and $B$-dependence of the SdH oscillations an effective carrier mass of $(0.275 \pm 0.005)m_{0}$ and a charge-carrier mean-free path of 215 Å are determined. Furthermore, in $B \geq 15$ T, the system is near the quantum limit and spin-splitting effects are observed.</p>

					<p>The temperature dependence of the rare-earth $\Delta_{2}$-bulk band has been regarded as an exemplary case which realizes the simple Stoner behavior. We examined the evolution of Gd$\Delta_{2}$ bulk bands with temperature in the range $0.5 \leq T/T_{C}\leq 1$ with spin-resolved, photoemission spectroscopy. The direct observation of the spin-dependent spectral line shapes reveals a complex temperature dependence and manifests a clear inadequacy of the Stoner model to the description of the magnetism in rare earths.</p>

In these metallic states, $\sim 10\%$ of $3d$ atoms seem to have large localized magnetic moments.

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0755-0760</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>NMR and NQR studies on two interesting systems (URu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, CeTIn$_{5}$) were performed under high pressure. (1) URu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$: In the pressure range 3.0 to 8.3 kbar, we have observed new $^{29}$Si NMR signals arising from the antiferromagnetic (AF) region besides the previously observed $^{29}$Si NMR signals which come from the paramagnetic (PM) region in the sample. This gives deﬁnite evidence for spatially-inhomogeneous development of AF ordering below $T_{0}$ of 17.5 K. The volume fraction is enhanced by applied pressure, whereas the value of internal ﬁeld ($\sim 91$ mT) remains constant up to 8.3 kbar. In the AF region, the ordered moment is about one order of magnitude larger than 0.03 $\mu_{B}$. (2) CeTIn$_{5}$: The pressure and temperature $(T)$ dependences of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$ of $^{115}$In in CeTIn$_{5}$ have shown that the superconductivity (SC) occurs close to an AF instability. From the $T$ dependences of $1/T_{1}$ and Knight shift below $T_{c}$, CeTIn$_{5}$ has been found to exhibit non-$s$ wave (probable $d$ wave) SC with even parity and line nodes in the SC energy gap.</p>

					<p>The formation of induced $5d$ magnetic moment on Ir in Fe$_{100-x}$Ir$_{x}$ ($x=3$, 10 and 17) and Co$_{100-x}$Ir$_{x}$ ($x=5$, 17, 25 and 32) alloys has been investigated by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at Ir L$_{2,3}$ absorption edges. Sum rule analysis of the XMCD data show that the orbital moment of Ir is in the range of $-0.071(2)\mu_{B}$ to $-0.030(1)\mu_{B}$ in Fe–Ir alloys and $-0.067(2)\mu_{B}$ to 0.024(1)$\mu_{B}$ in Co–Ir alloys. We ﬁnd that the total moment of Ir in Fe–Ir alloys is approximately 1/5 of the total $3d$ moment on Fe at all the three compositions. In contrast, the total moment on Ir in Co–Ir alloys varies between 1/6 to 1/16 of the $3d$ moment on cobalt. The observed trends of Ir moments and the role of interatomic exchange interactions in $5d$ moment formation are discussed.</p>

				<page>0773-0776</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The magnetic-ﬁeld-induced valence transition in rare-earth systems has been investigated using the periodic Anderson model supplemented by the Falicov–Kimball term. This model has been solved by ﬁrst decoupling the Falicov–Kimball term as proposed by Khomskii and Koharjan and then taking the limit of inﬁnite intra-site Coulomb repulsion. The valence transition both in the absence and in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld as a function of temperature is studied. It has been found that the system makes transition from non-magnetic to magnetic state when the magnetic ﬁeld increases beyond a critical value $H_{c}$. The phase boundary deﬁned in terms of reduced ﬁeld $H_{c}(T)/H_{c}(0)$ and reduced temperature $T/T_{v}$ ($T_{v}$ being the valence transition temperature in the absence of ﬁeld) is almost independent of the position of the localized level. The results are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations in Yb- and Eu-compounds.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Recently, the solid solution Ce$_{2}$Au$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si$_{3}$ has been shown to exhibit many magnetic anomalies associated with the competition between magnetic ordering and the Kondo effect. Here we report high pressure electrical resistivity of Ce$_{2}$AuSi$_{3}$, ac susceptibility $(\chi)$ and magnetoresistance of various alloys of this solid solution in order to gain better knowledge of the magnetism of these alloys. High pressure resistivity behavior is consistent with the proposal that Ce$_{2}$AuSi$_{3}$ lies at the left-hand side of the maximum in Doniach’s magnetic phase diagram. The ac $\chi$ data reveal that there are in fact two magnetic transitions, one at 2 K and the other at 3 K for this compound, both of which are spin-glass-like. However, as the Co concentration is increased, antiferromagnetism is stabilized for intermediate compositions before attaining non-magnetism for the Co end member.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of substitutional disorder on the superconducting properties of YNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C was studied by partially replacing yttrium and nickel by Lu and Pt, respectively. For the two series of (Y, Lu)Ni$_{2}$B$_{2}$C and Y(Ni, Pt)$_{2}$B$_{2}$C compounds, the upper critical ﬁeld $H_{c2}(T)$ and the speciﬁc heat $c_{p}(T, H)$ in the superconducting mixed state have been investigated. Disorder is found to reduce several relevant quantities such as $T_{c}$, the upper critical ﬁeld $H_{c2}(0)$ at $T = 0$ and a characteristic positive curvature of $H_{c2}(T)$ observed for these compounds near $T_{c}$. The $H_{c2}(T)$ data point to the clean limit for (Y, Lu) substitutions and to a transition to the quasi-dirty limit for (Ni, Pt) substitutions. The electronic speciﬁc heat contribution $\gamma (H)$ exhibits signiﬁcant deviations from the usual linear $\gamma (H)$ law. These deviations reduce with growing substitutional disorder but remain even in the quasidirty limit which is reached in the Y(Ni$_{1-x}$, Pt$_{x}$)$_{2}$B$_{2}$C samples for $x =0.1$.</p>

				<page>0799-0802</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microwave absorption studies have been carried out on MgB$_{2}$ superconductor using a standard X-band EPR spectrometer. The modulated low-ﬁeld microwave absorption signals recorded for polycrystalline (grain size $\sim 10\mu$m) samples suggested the absence of weak-link character. The ﬁeld dependent direct microwave absorption has been found to obey a $\sqrt{H}$ dependence with two different slopes, which indicated a transition from strongly pinned lattice to ﬂux ﬂow regime.</p>

				<title>Metal–insulator crossover in high $T_{c}$ cuprates: A gauge ﬁeld approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0803-0808</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A metal–insulator crossover appears in the experimental data for in-plane resistivity of underdoped cuprates and a range of superconducting cuprates in the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld suppressing superconductivity. We propose an explanation for this phenomenon based on a gauge ﬁeld theory approach to the t-J model. In this approach, based on a formal spin-charge separation, the low energy effective action describes gapful spinons (with a theoretically derived doping dependence of the gap $m^{2}_{s}\sim\delta|{\rm ln }\delta|$) and holons with ﬁnite Fermi surface $(\epsilon_{F}\sim t\delta)$ interacting via a gauge ﬁeld whose basic effect on the spinons is to bind them into overdamped spin waves, shifting their gap by a damping term linear in $T$, which causes the metal–insulator crossover. The presence of a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the plane acts by increasing the damping, in turn producing a big positive transverse in-plane magnetoresistance at low $T$, as experimentally observed.</p>

					<p>Both RuSr$_{2}$GdCu$_{2}$O$_{8-\delta}$ (Ru-1212) and RuSr$_{2}$Gd$_{1.5}$Ce$_{0.5}$Cu$_{2}O$_{10-\delta}$ (Ru-1222) exhibits magnetism and superconductivity, as seen by magnetization vs. temperature behavior measured in 5 Oe ﬁeld. Zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC) and ﬁeld-cooled (FC) magnetization data show branching at around 140 K and 100 K with a cusp at 135 K and 80 K and a diamagnetic transition around 20 K and 30 K in the ZFC part, for Ru-1212 and Ru-1222, respectively. The isothermal magnetization possesses a non-linear contribution due to a ferromagnetic component at low temperatures below 50 K for both samples. The resistance vs. temperature behavior of the samples in applied ﬁelds of 0, 3 and 7 T conﬁrmed superconductivity, with a different type of broadening of the superconductivity transition under magnetic ﬁelds for Ru-1212 from that known for conventional high-$T_{c}$ superconductors. The magnetoresistance (MR) is negative above the Ru magnetic ordering temperature at 135 K. Below the Ru magnetic ordering temperature, MR displays a positive peak at low ﬁelds and becomes negative at higher ﬁelds for Ru-1212. For Ru-1222, MR remains negative both above and below the ordering temperature. A maximum of 2% is observed for the negative MR value at the Ru magnetic ordering temperature. An electron diffraction pattern obtained for the Ru-1212 sample shows two types of superstructure: one has a weak spot at the centre of the $a-b$ rectangle, and the other only along the $b$ direction. Interestingly, Ru-1222 shows only clean $a-b$ and $a-c$ planes, without any superstructures.</p>

				<title>Fluctuation conductivity in cuprate superconductors</title>

				<page>0817-0825</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have measured the in-plane resistivity of Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ and Tl$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ single crystals in the temperature range 70–300 K. The thermodynamic ﬂuctuations in the conductivity of both the samples start around $\sim 125$ K. We ﬁnd the Lawrence and Doniach [1] model to be inadequate to describe the ﬂuctuation conductivity in these materials. The modiﬁcation suggested by Ramallo et al [4] where by the conductivity is enhanced due to the presence of two superconducting layers in each unit cell is also not adequate. We suggest the ﬂuctuation conductivity to be reduced due to the reduction in the density of states (DOS) of the quasiparticles which results due to the formation of Cooper pairs at the onset of the ﬂuctuations. The data agrees with the theory proposed by Dorin et al [5] which takes into account this reduction in DOS.</p>

				<page>0827-0837</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We review the observation of novel charge density wave (CDW) transitions in ternary R$_{5}$Ir$_{4}$Si$_{10}$ compounds. A high quality single crystal of Lu$_{5}$Ir$_{4}$Si$_{10}$ shows the formation of a commensurate CDW along $c$-axis below 80 K in the $(h, 0, l)$ plane that coexists with BCS type superconductivity below 3.9 K. However, in a single crystal of Er$_{5}$Ir$_{4}$Si$_{10}$, one observes the development of a 1D-incommensurate CDW at 155 K, which then locks into a purely commensurate state below 55 K. The well-localized Er$^{3}$ moments are antiferromagnetically ordered below 2.8 K which results in the coexistence of strongly coupled CDW with local moment antiferromagnetism in Er$_{5}$Ir$_{4}$Si$_{10}$. Unlike conventional CDW systems, extremely sharp transition (width $\sim 1.5$ K) in all bulk properties along with huge heat capacity anomalies in these compounds makes this CDW transition an interesting one.</p>

On cooling below 10 K in an applied ﬁeld of 4 kOe, the former causes a noticeable upturn in the ﬁeld cooled (FC) magnetization signal. Such a change in magnetic response is also reﬂected in the magnetic hysteresis loop generated at 9 K.

				<title>EPR study of deoxygenated high-temperature superconductors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0843-0848</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High-$T_{c}$ superconductors are EPR silent but on a little deoxygenation of the high-$T_{c}$ materials and their constituents, they yield rich but complex spectra. Spectra of (1) CuO, (2) BaCuO$_{2}$, (3) CaCuO$_{2}$, (4) Y$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$O$_{5}$, (5) La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$, (6) La$_{2-x}$M$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (M = Sr, Ba), (7) Y based-123, (8) Bi based-2201, 2212, 2223, (9) Tl based-2223 and (10) Hg based-1212,1223 have been studied. One thing common to all these materials is the CuO$_{2}$ plane which gets fragmented on deoxygenation and the inherent antiferromagnetic coupling is partially destroyed which results in the appearance of the spectra.</p>
					<p>The spectra recorded have been identiﬁed to be due to (1) Cu-monomer, (2) Cu-dimer, (3) Cutetramer, (4) Cu-octamer and (5) one signal at very low ﬁeld which could not be identiﬁed because there was no structure in it and may be due to fragments higher than octamers. Very big fragments do not give any spectra because the original AF order probably remains intact in them. It is expected that when the fragments become magnetically isolated from the bulk, they produce EPR spectra. Most of the spectra have been analyzed and their spin-Hamiltonian parameters determined. The spectra of these species vary a little in terms of g-value and ﬁne-structure splitting constant from sample to sample or even in the same sample and this may be attributed to some extra oxygen attachments retained with these species. Most frequently occurring species is the Cu-tetramer, (CuO)$_{4}$. As (CuO)$_{4}$ represents the unit cell of the all important two-dimensional CuO$_{2}$ plane of the high-$T_{c}$ materials, its spectra have been argued to provide some clue to the mechanism of high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity. The tetramer (CuO)$_{4}$ is a four one-half spin system and is essentially 16-fold degenerate by Heisenberg isotropic exchange, it is split into 6 components: one pentet, three triplets and two singlets. In superconductors the pentet appears to be the ground state and in the non-superconducting constituents the singlets seem to form the ground state as revealed by the temperature variation studies. In the case of La$_{1.854}$Sr$_{0.146}$CuO$_{4}$ we have found the signature of quantum stripe formation. The high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity theories involving spin bag, antiferromagnetic spin ﬂuctuations and magnons can be explained on the basis of Cu-tetramers.</p>

Very strong inﬂuence of the various exchange and correlation functions is concluded from the present study. The comparison with other such theoretical values is encouraging, which conﬁrms the applicability of our model potential in explaining the superconducting state parameters of binary mixture.</p>

				<title>Spectral properties of doped bilayer cuprates at ﬁnite temperatures</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0855-0859</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recently, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$, which possesses two CuO$_{2}$ layers in the same unit cell, have yielded very interesting results. For the overdoped samples, these results show a splitting of electronic states near $k = (\pi, 0)$ point of Brillioun zone. On the other hand, no splitting is observed in the underdoped samples. In view of this, the detailed studies including the doping and temperature dependence of the spectral properties become desirable. In this paper, we consider cuprates possessing two CuO$_{2}$ layers per unit cell. Each layer in the system is described by the $t-t'-J$ model and the two layers are coupled via an intrabilayer hopping term $(t_{\perp})$ and an intrabilayer exchange coupling $(J_{\perp}$)$. A self-consistent perturbation approach is used to calculate the electronic spectral function for different values of hole density, hole momentum and temperature. We ﬁnd that the imaginary part of the self energy is strongly momentum dependent which contradicts the suggestion that the Fermi surface of cuprates may be described by marginal Fermi liquid theory. We have calculated the spectral function for various values of intrabilayer parameters $t_{\perp}$ and $J_{\perp}$. For larger values of intrabilayer interactions we observe the splitting in the quasi-particle peak at $k = (\pi,0)$ which is in agreement with the recent observations. The splitting is also found to be sensitive to the hole concentration as well as the temperature of the system. We have also discussed the reasons why the splitting is absent in underdoped bilayer cuprates at low temperature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work, we report the interplay of single particle and Cooper pair tunnelings on the superconducting state of layered high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors. For this we have considered a model Hamiltonian incorporating the intra-planar interactions and the contributions arising due to the coupling between the planes. The interplanar interactions include the single particle tunneling as well as the Josephson tunneling of Cooper pairs between the two layers. The expression of the out-of-plane correlation parameter which describes the hopping of a particle from one layer to another layer in the superconducting state is obtained within a Bardeen–Cooper–Schriefer (BCS) formalism using the Green’s function technique. This correlation is found to be sensitive to the various parameter of the model Hamiltonian. We have calculated the out-of-plane contribution to the superconducting condensation energy. The calculated values of condensation energy are in agreement with those obtained from the speciﬁc heat and the $c$-axis penetration depth measurements on bilayer cuprates.</p>

					<p>We have investigated the superconducting properties of the Bi$_{1.7}$Pb$_{0.3}$Sr$_{2}$Ca$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{10+\delta}$ system with $x = 0.00$, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.1 by X-ray diffraction and magnetic susceptibility. The substitution of Ce for Ca has been found to drastically change the superconducting properties of the system. X-ray diffraction studies on these compounds indicate decrease in the $c$-parameter with increased substitution of Ce at Ca site and volume fraction of high $T_{c}(2 : 2 : 2 : 3)$ phase decreases and low $T_{c}$ phase increases. The magnetic susceptibility of this compound shows that the diamagnetic on set superconducting transition temperature (onset) varies from 109 K to 51 K for $x =0.00$, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.1. These results suggest the possible existence of Ce in a tetravalent state rather than a trivalent state in this system; that is, ${\rm Ca}^{2+} \to {\rm Ce}^{4+}$ replacement changes the hole carrier concentration. Hole ﬁlling is the cause of lowering $T_{c}$ of the system.</p>

In the present work, the results of the analysis of the neutron diffraction measurements at room temprerature on $x = 0.3$ and 0.5 samples are reported.

					<p>We calculate the longitudinal ultrasonic attenuation rate (UAR) in clean d-wave superconductors in the Meissner and the mixed phases. In the Meissner phase we calculate the contribution of previously ignored processes involving the excitation of a pair of quasi-holes or quasi-particles. There is a contribution $\propto T$ in the regime $k_{B}T \ll Q_{v_{F}} \ll \Delta_{0}$ and a contribution $\propto 1/T$ in the regime $Q_{v_{F}} \ll k_{B}T \ll \Delta_{0}$. We ﬁnd that these contributions to the UAR are large and cannot be ignored. In the mixed phase, using a semi-classical description, we calculate the electronic quasi-particle contribution to the UAR which at very low $T$, has a $T$ independent term proportional to $\sqrt{H}$.</p>

				<title>Investigating the vortex melting phenomenon in BSCCO crystals using magneto-optical imaging technique</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0893-0898</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using a novel differential magneto-optical imaging technique we investigate the phenomenon of vortex lattice melting in crystals of Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$ (BSCCO). The images of melting reveal complex patterns in the formation and evolution of the vortex solid–liquid interface with varying ﬁeld $(H)$/temperature $(T)$. We believe that the complex melting patterns are due to a random distribution of material disorder/inhomogeneities across the sample, which create ﬂuctuations in the local melting temperature or ﬁeld value. To study the ﬂuctuations in the local melting temperature/ﬁeld, we have constructed maps of the melting landscape $T_{m}(H, r)$, viz., the melting temperature $(T_{m})$ at a given location $(r)$ in the sample at a given ﬁeld $(H)$. A study of these melting landscapes reveals an unexpected feature: the melting landscape is not ﬁxed, but changes rather dramatically with varying ﬁeld and temperature along the melting line. It is concluded that the changes in both the scale and shape of the landscape result from the competing contributions of different types of quenched disorder which have opposite effects on the local melting transition.</p>

				<title>The microscopic investigation of structures of moving ﬂux lines by neutron and muon techniques</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0899-0901</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have used a variety of microscopic techniques to reveal the structure and motion of ﬂux line arrangements, when the ﬂux lines in low $T_{c}$ type II superconductors are caused to move by a transport current. Using small-angle neutron scattering by the ﬂux line lattice (FLL), we are able to demonstrate directly the alignment by motion of the nearest-neighbor FLL direction. This tends to be parallel to the direction of ﬂux line motion, as had been suspected from two-dimensional simulations. We also see the destruction of the ordered FLL by plastic ﬂow and the bending of ﬂux lines. Another technique that our collaboration has employed is the direct measurement of ﬂux line motion, using the ultra-high-resolution spectroscopy of the neutron spin-echo technique to observe the energy change of neutrons diffracted by moving ﬂux lines. The muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) technique gives the distribution of values of magnetic ﬁeld within the FLL. We have recently succeeded in performing $\mu$SR measurements while the FLL is moving. Such measurements give complementary information about the local speed and orientation of the FLL motion. We conclude by discussing the possible application of this technique to thin ﬁlm superconductors.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We compare the results of small angle neutron scattering on the ﬂux line lattice (FLL) obtained in the borocarbide superconductor LuNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C with the applied ﬁeld along the $c$- and $a$-axes. For $\mathbf{H}||\mathbf{c}$ the temperature dependence of the FLL structural phase transition from square to hexagonal symmetry was investigated. Above 10 K the transition onset ﬁeld, $H_{2}(T)$, rises sharply, bending away from $H_{c2}(T)$ in contradiction to theoretical predictions of the two merging. For $\mathbf{H}||\mathbf{a}$ a ﬁrst order FLL reorientation transition is observed at $H_{\text{tr}} =3$-3.5 kOe. Below $H_{\text{tr}}$ the FLL nearest neighbor direction is parallel to the $b$-axis, and above $H_{\text{tr}}$ to the $c$-axis. This transition cannot be explained using nonlocal corrections to the London model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have performed a series of neutron diffraction experiments from the magnetic order and the vortex lattice in single crystal ErNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C. The incommensurate magnetic structure develops additional even harmonics below the ‘ferromagnetic’ ordering temperature, $T_{F}$ of 2.3 K. This feature and the existence of rods of diffuse scattering suggest the development of ferromagnetic microdomain walls. The magnetic structure is very sensitive to the application of a magnetic ﬁeld with changes in modulation vector and harmonic content. Studies of the vortex lattice show the presence of a $45^{\circ}$ reorientation transition and a distorted hexagonal to square transition as a function of applied ﬁeld. Further distortions of the vortex lattice occur at $T_{N}$, but no changes are seen at $T_{F}$.</p>

					<p>We have performed extensive small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) diffraction studies of the vortex lattice in single crystal YNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C for $B||c$. High-resolution SANS, combined with a ﬁeld-oscillation vortex lattice preparation technique, allows us to separate Bragg scattered intensities from two orthogonal domains and accurately determine the unit cell angle, $\beta$. The data suggest that upon increasing ﬁeld there is a ﬁnite transition width where both low- and high-ﬁeld distorted hexagonal vortex lattice phases, mutually rotated by $45^{\circ}$, coexist. The smooth variation of diffracted intensity from each phase through the transition corresponds to a redistribution of populations between the two types of domains.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Understanding the dynamics of vortex matter subjected to random and correlated pinning disorders in layered superconductors remains a topic of considerable interest. The dynamical behavior of vortices in these systems shows a rich variety of effects due to many competing interactions. Here, we study the ac response of as-grown as well as heavy-ion-irradiated Tl$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$ (Tl-2212) thin ﬁlms by using a micro Hall-probe susceptometer. We ﬁnd that the dynamics of vortices in the high-temperature, low-ﬁeld regime of the $H-T$ phase diagram investigated here depends on the nature of pinning defects. While the decay of screening currents $J(t)$ indicates a glassy behavior in both types of samples, the nature of the glassy phase is different in the two cases. Samples with columnar defects show distinct signature of a Bose glass in the measurement of $J(t)$ and the angular dependence of the irreversibility ﬁeld $(B_{\text{irr}})$.</p>

					<p>We present a novel ac susceptibility technique for the study of vortex creep in superconducting thin ﬁlms. With this technique we study the dynamics of dilute vortices in $c$-axis oriented Y-123, Hg-1212, and Tl-1212 thin ﬁlms, as well as $a$-axis oriented Hg-1212 thin ﬁlms. Results on the Hg-1212 and Tl-1212 thin ﬁlms indicate that dislocation-mediated plastic ﬂux creep of single vortices dominates at low temperatures and ﬁelds. As the temperature (or the ﬁeld) is increased, the increasing vortex–vortex interactions promote a collective behavior, which can be characterized by elastic creep with a non-zero $\mu$ exponent. Also, in some of these samples effects of thermally assisted quantum creep are visible up to 45 K in some of these samples. In Y-123 thin ﬁlms, creep is found to be collective down to the lowest temperatures and ﬁelds investigated, while the quantum creep persists only up to 10–11 K.</p>

				<title>Ferrites – what is new?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0995-1002</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ferrites, combining insulating and ferrimagnetic properties, have long been used in technology. The aim of this paper is to focus on new features in these materials. In the classical theory of ferrimagnets, Neel had predicted the unusual thermal variation of the spontaneous magnetization, such as, the disappearance of the magnetization at a temperature which was not the Curie temperature but at a point where there was compensation of the spontaneous magnetization of the two sublattices. We show experimentally that temperature $(T_{K})$ in spinel oxide is different under the ZFC and FC magnetization method. To our knowledge, only limited attempt has been made to study $T_{K}$ as very few systems exhibit such behavior. In general, some of the ferrites have speciﬁc semiconducting properties, e.g., a very low carrier mobility. We discuss the anomalies of the magneto-resistance in ferrites that occur at order–disorder and order–order magnetic phase transition along with our ac and dc conductivity data near the spin compensation temperature. Another notable feature of the ferrites is that, upon irradiation of heavy ions, one can tune the magnetic ordering on bulk sample without destructive effects, i.e., irradiation-induced magnetization. It is interesting to note that spinel ferrite (nano) particle is an ideal small particle magnetic system as the crystal chemistry issue can be controlled, unlike pure metal particle systems where the crystal chemistry issues are basically ﬁxed. In relevance to this, we will also discuss the future prospects, namely, the effect of irradiation on small particle magnetism, as, so far, only a limited attempt has been made in this ﬁeld.</p>

				<title>BiFeO$_{3}$ thin ﬁlms: Novel effects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1003-1008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we report synthesis of phase-pure highly resistive magnetoelectric BiFeO$_{3}$ thin ﬁlms on Pt/TiO$_{2}$/SiO$_{2}$/Si substrate by using pulsed laser deposition technique. For the ﬁrst time saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loop has been observed. It has conﬁrmed the presence of ferroelectricity in BiFeO$_{3}$ compound. The ﬁlms exhibit dielectric anomaly near Neel temperature. This anomaly is related to the inﬂuence of vanishing magnetic order on the electric order. In situ domain alignment occurs during observation of the ﬁlms under transmission electron microscope.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1009-1012</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electron-doped (Ba$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$)MnO$_{3}$ compounds were prepared for $x = 0-0.5$. Measurements of X-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature and temperature variation of dc electrical resistivity down to 20 K were carried out. Samples with $x = 0.2-0.5$ exhibit metal–insulator (M–I) transition. The maximum M–I transition temperature $(T_{c})$ of 289 K was observed for 30% of La doping $(x = 0.3)$. XRD patterns of these samples $(x = 0.2-0.5)$ were analyzed using Rietveld reﬁnement. These samples are found to be mostly in single-phase form with orthorhombic symmetry (space group Pbnm). We have found strong correlation between Mn–O–Mn bond angles and $T_{c}$ of M–I transition. The resistivity data below $T_{c}$ could be ﬁtted to the expression $\rho=\rho_{1} +\rho_{2}T^{2}$ and this shows that double exchange interaction plays a major role even in Mn$^{4+}$-rich compound. Above $T_{c}$ the resistivity data were ﬁtted to variable range hopping and small polaron models.</p>

					<p>We report polarized Raman scattering in single crystals of Nd$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$. The temperature dependence of the MnO$_{6}$ octahedral bending and stretching modes observed in the XX spectra points to the existence of local lattice distortions, possibly polarons.

				<title>Mn site substitution of La$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ with closed shell ions: Effect on magnetic transition temperature</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1019-1026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mn site is substituted with closed shell ions (Al, Ga, Ti, Zr and a certain combination of Zr and Al) and also with Fe and Ru ions carrying the magnetic moment ($S=5/2$ and 2 respectively) at a ﬁxed concentration of 5 at %. Substitution did not change either the crystal symmetry or the oxygen stoichiometry. All substituents were found to suppress both the metal–insulator and ferromagnetic transition temperatures ($T_{p}(\rho)$ and $T_{C}$, respectively) to varied extents. Two main contributions identiﬁed for the suppression are the lattice disorder arising due to difference in the ionic radii between the substituent ($r_{M}$) and the Mn$^{3+}$ ion ($r_{Mn^{3+}}$) and in the case of the substituents carrying a magnetic moment, the type of magnetic coupling between the substituent and that of the neighboring Mn ion.</p>

Novel wet chemical route has been developed to produce ﬁne particles of BiFeO$_{3}$ with controlled size and size distribution.

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1035-1039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of simultaneous substitution of a ﬂuctuating cation and a divalent cation in LaMnO$_{3}$ perovskite modiﬁes the properties of the material to exhibit large valence colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect. A good example of these properties is (La$_{1-2x}$Pr$_{x}$Ca$_{x}$)MnO$_{3}$ (LPCMO) type CMR material. In this communication it is reported that, with the increase in $x$ (for $x = 0.1$, 0.15, 0.2), the $T_{c}$ varies between 100 and 120 K with improvisation in metal–insulator transition. Interestingly, resistance increases with $x$ from few hundred ohms to few kilo ohms with corresponding decrease in the unit cell volume. The results of the studies using X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrical resistivity, magnetoresistance and ac susceptibility measurements on LPCMO samples for understanding the structural, transport and magnetic properties are discussed in detail.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1041-1044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrical resistance $(R)$ measurements of a bulk La$_{0.33}$Nd$_{0.33}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ perovskite in magnetic ﬁelds up to 40 kOe have revealed anomalous temperature hysteretic effects both in 0 Oe and 20 kOe magnetic ﬁelds. The sharp peak observed in the $R$ vs. $T$ plot indicates the occurrence of metal-to-insulator (M–I) transition at a temperature of $T_{\text{MI}} = 110$ K and 140 K, for cooling and warming paths, respectively. An applied magnetic ﬁeld of 20 kOe reduces the resistance and shifts $T_{\text{MI}}$ to 160 K and 185 K for cooling and warming, respectively. We have observed a much higher resistance in the cooling path than in the warming path leading to the hysteretic resistance ratio $(R_{\text{cool}}/R_{\text{warm}}$) of 200 at 110 K and 1.8 at 160 K for 0 Oe and 20 kOe, respectively. Record values of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) have been achieved. The CMR value reaches nearly 99% in the temperature ranges of 90 K to 140 K and 90 K to 170 K for 20 kOe and 40 kOe magnetic ﬁelds in the cooling mode, respectively. The observed unusual behavior is attributed to the co-existence of La-rich and Nd-rich domains assumed to be distributed randomly in the compound.</p>

The end members of this series, namely Pr$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ and La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ are canonical charge-ordered (CO) and ferromagnetic manganites, respectively. The onset of the CO state in Pr$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ is manifested by a pronounced insulating behavior below $\sim 200$ K. The CO state remains stable even when a large ($\sim 2\times 10^{5}$ V/cm) electric ﬁeld is applied across the thin ﬁlm samples. However, on substitution of Pr with La, a crossover from the highly resistive CO state to a state of metallic character is observed at relatively low electric ﬁelds. The current–voltage characteristics of the samples at low temperatures show hysteretic and history dependent effects. The electric ﬁeld driven charge transport in the system is modelled on the basis of an inhomogeneous medium consisting of ferromagnetic metallic clusters dispersed in a CO background.</p>

The structural and magnetotransport properties of the ﬁlms have been studied. The sharp peak in the temperature dependence of the resistance corresponding to metal-to-insulator transition $(T_{p})$ has been observed at a temperature of $T_{p}=82$ K, 97 K and 110 K for 0 Oe, 20 kOe and 40 kOe magnetic ﬁelds, respectively. The ﬁlm exhibits a large nearly temperature-independent magnetoresistance around 99% in the temperature regime below $T_{p}$. The zero ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC) and ﬁeld-cooled (FC) magnetization data at 50 Oe shows irreversibility between the ZFC and FC close to the ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_{c}= 250$ K. The ZFC temperature data of the ﬁlm displays ferromagnetic behavior for higher temperature regime $T_{c}=250$ K $&gt; T &gt; T_{p}= 82$ K, and a decrease in magnetization with decreasing temperature up to 5 K below 82 K exhibiting a sort of antiferromagnetic behavior in the low temperature regime $(T &lt; 82{\rm \ K}= T_{p}= T_{N})$.</p>

The present work is on the irradiation study of ferromagnetic metallic glasses, where both dimensional change and modiﬁcation of magnetic anisotropy are expected. Magnetic anisotropy was measured using Mössbauer spectroscopy of virgin and irradiated Fe$_{40}$Ni$_{40}$B$_{20}$ and Fe$_{40}$Ni$_{38}$Mo$_{4}$B$_{18}$ metallic glass ribbons. 90 MeV $^{127}$I beam was used for the irradiations. Irradiation doses were $5\times 10^{13}$ and $7.5\times 10^{13}$ ions/cm$^{2}$. The relative intensity ratios $D_{23}$ of the second and third lines of the Mössbauer spectra were measured to determine the magnetic anisotropy. The virgin samples of both the materials display in-plane magnetic anisotropy, i.e., the spins are oriented parallel to the ribbon plane. Irradiation is found to cause reduction in magnetic anisotropy. Near-complete randomization of magnetic moments is observed at high irradiation doses. Correlation is found between the residual stresses introduced by ion irradiation and the change in magnetic anisotropy.</p>

					<p>New $R_{2}$Ti$_{3}$Ge$_{4}$ ($R$ = Dy, Ho and Er) intermetallic compounds have been synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction and low temperature ac magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power measurements were carried out. The compounds crystallize in the parent, Sm$_{5}$Ge$_{4}$-type orthorhombic structure (space group Pnma) and lanthanide contraction is observed as one moves along the rare-earth series. The changeover from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase happens at low temperatures and the ordering temperature scales with the de Gennes factor. The electrical resistivity is metallic with a negative curvature above 100 K. Thermopower displays a weak maximum at temperatures less than 50 K signifying the possible phonon and magnon drag effects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Rare earth element substituted bismuth ferrites (BiFeO$_{3}$) are of enormous importance as magnetoelectric materials. The polycrystalline samples of Bi$_{x}$La$_{1-x}$FeO$_{3}$ ($x=0$, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) were prepared by solid-state reaction using standard ceramic method. The single-phase formation of these compounds was conﬁrmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The samples with $x = 0$, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 are found to be orthorhombic while the sample with $x = 0.8$ is triclinic. The dielectric constant $(\epsilon')$ and dissipation factor $(\tan \delta)$ were measured in the frequency range 100 Hz to 1 MHz at room temperature and as a function of temperature at certain ﬁxed frequencies (1 kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz, 1 MHz). All the samples showed dielectric dispersion. The dielectric constant with temperature shows a broad peak; the peak temperature shifts with frequency which reﬂects the relaxor-type behavior. The peak above 600 K in the measured temperature range corresponds to antiferromagnetic ordering temperature (Néel temperature). The broadness of the peak changes with composition. The ac conductivity as well as $\epsilon'$ are found to be maximum for the sample $x = 0.2$ at room temperature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The response of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices depends critically on the ﬁlm microstructure, with parameters such as layer thickness and interfacial abruptness being crucial. This paper presents results obtained using high resolution electron microscopy (HREM), chemical mapping and atom probe microanalysis. Local variations in the magnetic properties are induced by the microstructure and also when the ﬁlms are patterned to form small elements. These lead to changes in the magnetization reversal mechanism. Some results of the studies of the magnetization reversal carried out using in situ in Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) magnetizing experiments are also included.</p>

				<title>Shape memory alloys – characterization techniques</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1131-1139</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Shape memory alloys are the generic class of alloys that show both thermal and mechanical memory. The basic physics involved in the shape memory effect is the reversible thermoelastic martensitic transformation. In general, there exists two phases in shape memory alloys, viz., a hightemperature phase or austenitic phase (A) and a low-temperature phase or martensitic phase (M). In addition, an intermediate R phase exists in some special cases. The M $\leftrightarrow$ A transformation is associated with a recoverable strain of about 6.5–8% and the R $\leftrightarrow$ A transformation is associated with a recoverable strain of about 1%. The former transformation has been widely used in the applications like antenna deployment of satellite, aerospace couplings, orthodontic arch wires, medical guide wires for diagnostic and therapeutic catheters and other industrial applications. Our group has been giving emphasis to the characterization techniques for R phase, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), electrical resistivity probe (ER) and thermomechanical analyzer (TMA). R phase is found to have attractive features like stability against thermal cycling, a small thermal hysteresis and a negligible strain recovery fatigue. DSC has been used successfully to characterize the recoverable strain parameters, apart from the determination of transformation temperatures. ER is used, for the systematic study of the dependence of various phases on heat-treatment temperatures. TMA has been effectively employed for the study of the mixed phases. A space-rotating platform is designed and fabricated, using an actuator of shape memory spring, for obtaining controlled rotations. The efﬁciency and the reliability of this actuator has been tested, over a million thermal cycles.</p>

				<title>Insulator–metal transition in a conservative system: An evidence for mobility coalescence in island silver ﬁlms</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1141-1145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aging, which manifests itself as an irreversible increase in electrical resistance in island metal ﬁlms is of considerable interest from both academic as well as applications point of view. Aging is attributed to various causes, oxidation of islands and mobility of islands followed by coalescence (mobility coalescence) being the main contenders. The effect of parameters like substrate temperature, substrate cleaning, residual gases in the vacuum chamber, ultrasonic vibration of the substrate, suggest that the mobility coalescence is responsible for the aging in island metal ﬁlms. Electron microscopy studies show evidence for mobility of islands at high substrate temperatures. The comparison of aging data of island silver ﬁlms deposited on glass substrates in ultra high vacuum and high vacuum suggests that the oxidation of islands, as being responsible for aging in these ﬁlms, can be ruled out. Further, under certain conditions of deposition, island silver ﬁlms exhibit a dramatic and drastic fall in electrical resistance, marking the insulator–metal transition. This interesting transition observed in a conservative system – after the stoppage of deposition of the ﬁlm – is a clear evidence for mobility coalescence of islands even at room temperature. The sudden fall in resistance is preceded by ﬂuctuations in resistance with time and the ﬂuctuations are attributed to the making and breaking of the percolation path in the ﬁlm</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1147-1151</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have carried out extensive studies on the self-injection problem in barrierless heterojunctions between La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LCMO) and YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) thin ﬁlms. The heterojunctions were formed in situ by sequentially growing LCMO and YBCO ﬁlms on $\langle 100\rangle$ LaAlO$_{3}$ (LAO) substrate using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system. YBCO micro-bridges with 64 $\mu$m width were patterned both on the LAO (control) and LCMO side of the substrate. Critical current, $I_{c}$, was measured at 77 K on both the control side as well as the LCMO side for different YBCO ﬁlm thickness. It was observed that while the control side showed a $J_{c}$ of $\sim 2\times 10^{6}$ A/cm$^{2}$, the LCMO side showed about half the value for the same thickness (1800 Å). The difference in $J_{c}$ indicates that a certain thickness of YBCO has become ‘effectively’ normal due to self-injection. From the measurement of $J_{c}$ at two different thicknesses (1800 Å and 1500 Å) of YBCO ﬁlms both on the LAO as well as the LCMO side, the value of self-injection length (at 77 K) was estimated to be $\sim 900$ Å. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that self-injection length has been quantiﬁed. A control experiment carried out with LaNiO$_{3}$ deposited by PLD on YBCO did not show any evidence of self-injection.</p>

A compact low ﬁeld SQUID magnetometer insertible in a liquid helium storage dewar has also been developed inhouse and is in use. Efforts to build a high ﬁeld SQUID magnetometer, SQUID-DAC system, are in progress. A planar gradiometric DC SQUID sensor for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) application to be used in relatively unshielded environment has been designed and developed. An easily portable NDE cryostat with a small lift-off distance, to be used in external locations has been designed and tested. The magnetic ﬁeld produced by a given two-dimensional current density distribution is inverted using the Fourier transform technique.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>La$_{0.67}$Ba$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ (LBMO) thin ﬁlm is deposited on a $36.7^{\circ}$C SrTiO$_{3}$ bicrystal substrate using laser ablation technique. A microbridge is created across bicrystal grain boundary and its characteristics are compared with a microbridge on the LBMO ﬁlm having no grain boundary. Presence of grain boundary exhibits substantial magnetoresistance ratio (MRR) in the low ﬁeld and low temperature region. Bicrystal grain boundary contribution in MRR disappears at temperature $T &gt; 175$ K. At low temperature, $I-V$ characteristic of the microbridge across bicrystal grain boundary is nonlinear. Analysis of temperature dependence of dynamic conductance–voltage characteristics of the bicrystal grain boundary indicates that at low temperatures ($T &lt; 175$ K) carrier transport across the grain boundary in LBMO ﬁlm is dominated by inelastic tunneling via pairs of manganese atoms and tunneling through disordered oxides. At higher temperatures ($T &gt; 175$ K), magnetic scattering process is dominating. Decrease of bicrystal grain boundary contribution in magnetoresistance with the increase in temperature is due to enhanced spin-ﬂip scattering process.</p>

In an earlier publication we have reported the rectifying characteristic of La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$/La$_{0.7}$Ce$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ tunnel junction at room temperature, showing that it is possible to fabricate a diode out of the polaronic insulator regime of doped manganites. Here we report the magneto-transport properties of such a tunnel junction above and below the metal–insulator transition. We show, from the large positive magnetoresistance of the tunnel junction at low temperature, that La$_{0.7}$Ce$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ could be a minority spin carrier ferromagnet.

In the present investigation, metal/superconductor/semiconductor (Ag/Tl-2223/CdSe) hetero-nanostructures have successfully been fabricated using dc electrodeposition technique and were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies. The measurement of junction capacitance as a function of biasing voltage was used for the estimation of junction built-in-potential $(V_{D})$ and to study the charge distribution in a heterojunction. The Mott–Schottky plots were measured for each junction in dark and under the photo-irradiation. The effect of laser irradiation on $C-V$ characteristics of hetero-nanostructure has been studied.</p>

The LCMO and YBCO ﬁlms were grown on $\langle 100\rangle$ LaAlO$_{3}$ (LAO) substrate sequentially using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). $I-V$ measurements carried out at 77 K show that while normal critical current, $I^{n}_{c}$, of the micro-bridge is 80 mA, the critical current, $I^{p}_{c}$, through the micro-bridge when injected from the CMR layer is 38 mA. This clearly shows that spin-polarized quasiparticles injected from the CMR layer into the YBCO layer suppress the critical current of the superconductor via the pair-breaking phenomena.</p>

The complementary behavior of dielectric permittivity with temperature of the composite has been exploited to obtain the desired turning point in the resonant frequency. The frequency of the composite structure is found to be independent of the shield diameter beyond four times the puck diameter.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0019-0031</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyze the formation of fragments in O+Br reaction at different incident energies between $E/A = 50$ MeV and 200 MeV. This study is carried out within the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model coupled with recently advanced simulated annealing clusterization algorithm (SACA). For comparison, we also use the conventional minimum spanning tree (MST) method. Our detailed study shows that the SACA can detect the ﬁnal stable fragment conﬁguration as early as 60 fm/c which is marked by a dip in the heaviest fragment. On the other hand, the MST method needs several hundred fm/c to identify the ﬁnal stable distribution. A comparison of the charge distribution with experimental data shows that the SACA is able to reproduce the data very nicely whereas (as reported earlier) the MST method fails to break the spectator matter into intermediate mass fragments. Furthermore, our results with SACA method indicate the onset of multi-fragmentation around 75 MeV/A which is again in good agreement with experimental ﬁndings.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) condition on emission and hydrodynamics of typical inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) plasmas are studied. The average degree of ionization at high temperatures is seen to be much lower compared to the values obtained from Thomas–Fermi scaling or Saha equation for high-$Z$ element like gold. LTE and non-LTE predictions for emitted radiation from laser-driven gold foil are compared with the experimental results and it is seen that non-LTE simulations show a marked improvement over LTE results. The effects of one group and multigroup, LTE and non-LTE approximations of radiation transport on hydrodynamic parameters are studied for laser-driven aluminium and gold foils. It is further seen that non-LTE and multigroup effects play an important role in predicting conversion efﬁciency of laser light to X-rays</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of Nd$^{3+}$ concentration on the CW and Q-switched laser performances at 1064 nm from Nd : YVO$_{4}$ has been studied under diode laser pumping in identical laser conﬁguration. The Nd$^{3+}$ concentrations used were 1, 2 and 3 at. % in YVO$_{4}$ crystals. Under the CW operations we have compared the thermal lensing effect, slope efﬁciencies and also the beam quality at the fourth-order degeneracy conﬁguration. Q-switching was done with the help of an acousto-optic modulator and we have compared the pulses obtained from Nd : YVO$_{4}$ laser with different doping concentration. It was found that the 1 at.%-doped crystal is the best, offering highest optical-to-optical conversion efﬁciency (55%), lowest fractional heat load (24%), highest pulse energy (80 $\mu$J) and shortest pulse width (20 ns). It was also found that there was not much difference in performances for 2 and 3 at. %-doped crystals both in CW and Q-switched conﬁgurations.</p>

				<title>Control of a coupled map lattice model for vortex shedding in the wake of a cylinder</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0091-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ﬂow behind a vibrating ﬂexible cable at low Reynolds numbers can exhibit complex wake structures such as lace-like patterns, vortex dislocations and frequency cells. These structures have been observed in experiments and numerical simulations, and are predicted by a previously developed low-order coupled map lattice (CML). The discrete (in time and space) CML models consist of a series of diffusively coupled circle map oscillators along the cable span. Motivated by a desire to modify the complex wake patterns behind ﬂexible vibrating cables, we have studied the addition of control terms into the highly efﬁcient CML models and explored the resulting dynamics. Proportional, adaptive proportional and discontinuous non-linear (DNL) control methods were used to derive the control laws. The ﬁrst method employed occasional proportional feedback. The adaptive method used spatio-temporal feedback control. The DNL method used a discontinuous feedback linearization procedure, and the controller was designed for the resulting linearized system using eigenvalue assignment. These techniques were applied to a modeled vortex dislocation structure in the wake of a vibrating cable in uniform freestream ﬂow. Parallel shedding patterns were achieved for a range of forcing frequency-forcing amplitude combinations studied to validate the control theory. The adaptive proportional and DNL methods were found to be more effective than the proportional control method due to the incorporation of a spatially varying feedback gain across the cylinder span. The DNL method was found to be the most efﬁcient controller of the low-order CML model. The required control level across the cable span was correlated to the 1/1 lock-on behavior of the temporal circle map.</p>

				<title>Fabrication of polystyrene hollow microspheres as laser fusion targets by optimized density-matched emulsion technique and characterization</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0113-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inertial conﬁnement fusion, frequently referred to as ICF, inertial fusion, or laser fusion, is a means of producing energy by imploding small hollow microspheres containing thermonuclear fusion fuel. Polymer microspheres, which are used as fuel containers, can be produced by solution-based micro-encapsulation technique better known as density-matched emulsion technique. The speciﬁcations of these microspheres are very rigorous, and various aspects of the emulsion hydrodynamics associated with their production are important in controlling the ﬁnal product. This paper describes about the optimization of various parameters associated with density-matched emulsion method in order to improve the surface smoothness, wall thickness uniformity and sphericity of hollow polymer microspheres. These polymer microshells have been successfully fabricated in our lab, with 3–30 $\mu$m wall thickness and 50–1600 $\mu$m diameters. The sphericity and wall thickness uniformity are better than 99%. Elimination of vacuoles and high yield rate has been achieved by adopting the step-wise heating of W$_{1}$/O/W$_{2}$ emulsion for solvent removal.</p>

				<page>0133-0142</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have deposited relatively thick ($\sim 60$ nm) Ge layers on Br-passivated Si(111) substrates by thermal evaporation under high vacuum conditions at room temperature. Ge has grown in a layer-plus-island mode although it is different from the Stranski–Krastanov growth mode observed in epitaxial growth. Both the islands and the layer are nanocrystalline. This appears to be a consequence of reduction of surface free energy of the Si(111) substrate by Br-passivation. The size distribution of the Ge nanoislands has been determined. The Br–Si(111) substrates were prepared by a liquid treatment, which may not produce exactly reproducible surfaces. Nevertheless, some basic features of the nanostructural island growth are reasonably reproducible, while there are variations in the details of the island size distribution.</p>

					<p>Understanding of the basic nature of arc root ﬂuctuation is still one of the unsolved problems in thermal arc plasma physics. It has direct impact on myriads of thermal plasma applications being implemented at present. Recently, chaotic nature of arc root behavior has been reported through the analysis of voltages, acoustic and optical signals which are generated from a hollow copper electrode arc plasma torch. In this paper we present details of computations involved in the estimation process of various dynamic properties and show how they reﬂect chaotic behavior of arc root in the system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the notion of spin squeezing considering two mutually exclusive classes of spin-$s$ states, namely, oriented and non-oriented states. Our analysis shows that the oriented states are not squeezed while non-oriented states exhibit squeezing. We also present a new scheme for construction of spin-$s$ states using $2s$ spinors oriented along different axes. Taking the case of $s = 1$, we show that the ‘non-oriented’ nature and hence squeezing arise from the intrinsic quantum correlations that exist among the spinors in the coupled state.</p>

Hence, it seems impossible to cast them in any real time ordering and maintain a causal explanation in which an earlier event inﬂuences a later one by arbitrarily fast communication.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Magnetochiral anisotropy refers to the phenomenon that when light is passed through a chiral medium placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld, the refractive index, or equivalently, the absorption encountered by the light differs depending on whether it travels parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. It is a very small effect, the change in refractive index because of this effect alone being of the order of $10^{-11}$. This effect has recently been measured in an active ring laser interferometer in which the detection scheme convincingly eliminates the contributions from natural optical activity, the Faraday effect and other stray anisotropies in the system. The phenomenon is important in the context of fundamental interactions between light and matter and the governing symmetry principles, and also in biochemistry as one possible explanation for the homochirality of life.</p>

					<p>Entangling an unknown qubit with one type of reference state is generally impossible. However, entangling an unknown qubit with two types of reference states is possible. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of states called zero sum amplitude (ZSA) multipartite, pure entangled states for qubits and study their salient features. Using shared-ZSA states, local operations and classical communication, we give a protocol for creating multipartite entangled states of an unknown quantum state with two types of reference states at remote places. This provides a way of encoding an unknown pure qubit state into a multiqubit entangled state.</p>

We demonstrate this with selective control of decoherence for a multilevel system with a simple linearly chirped pulse. We use a multiphoton density-matrix approach to explore the effects of ultrafast shaped pulses for two-level systems that do not have a single photon resonance, and show that many multiphoton results are surprisingly similar to the single-photon results. Finally, we choose two speciﬁc chirped pulses: one that always generates inversion and the other that always generates self-induced transparency to demonstrate an ensemble CNOT gate.</p>

				<title>Developments in quantum information processing by nuclear magnetic resonance: Use of quadrupolar and dipolar couplings</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0243-0254</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Use of dipolar and quadrupolar couplings for quantum information processing (QIP) by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is described. In these cases, instead of the individual spins being qubits, the $2^{n}$ energy levels of the spin-system can be treated as an $n$-qubit system. It is demonstrated that QIP in such systems can be carried out using transition-selective pulses, in CH$_{3}$CN, $^{13}$CH$_{3}$CN, $^{7}$Li ($I = 3/2$) and $^{133}$Cs ($I = 7/2$), oriented in liquid crystals yielding 2 and 3 qubit systems. Creation of pseudopure states, implementation of logic gates and arithmetic operations (half-adder and subtractor) have been carried out in these systems using transition-selective pulses.</p>

					<p>We show that in the case of unknown harmonic oscillator coherent statesit is possible to achieve what we call perfect information cloning.

By making use of this perfect information cloning it would be possible to estimate the original state through measurements and make arbitrary number of copies of the estimator.

					<p>It is argued that immense physical resources – for nonlocal communication, espionage, and exponentially-fast computation – are hidden from us by quantum noise, and that this noise is not fundamental but merely a property of an equilibrium state in which the universe happens to be at the present time. It is suggested that ‘non-quantum’ or nonequilibrium matter might exist today in the form of relic particles from the early universe. We describe how such matter could be detected and put to practical use. Nonequilibrium matter could be used to send instantaneous signals, to violate the uncertainty principle, to distinguish non-orthogonal quantum states without disturbing them, to eavesdrop on quantum key distribution, and to outpace quantum computation (solving NP-complete problems in polynomial time).</p>

				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0279-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Near the interface between a normal metal and a superconductor, Cooper pairs penetrate into the normal side, giving rise to the proximity effect. The two electrons of these pairs have entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Nonlocal features of quantum mechanics can be probed by separating these two electrons. This is achieved with a fork geometry with two normal leads containing either spin- or energy-selective ﬁlters. A signature of entanglement can be detected by measuring the positive noise cross-correlations in this fork. In the case of energy ﬁlters, Bell-inequality checks constitute a deﬁnite probe of entanglement. We formulate Bell-type inequalities in terms of current–current cross-correlations associated with contacts with varying magnetization orientations. We ﬁnd maximal violation (as in photons) when a superconductor is the particle source.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>I prove that there is no spooky action at a distance and nonlocal state-reduction during measurements on quantum entangled systems. The prediction of quantum theory as well as experimental results are in conﬂict with the concept of nonlocal state-reduction, as conclusively shown here under very general assumptions. This has far-reaching implications in the interpretation of quantum mechanics in general, and demands a radical change in its present interpretation of measurements on entangled multiparticle systems. Motivated by these results we re-examine Bell’s theorem for correlations of entangled systems and ﬁnd that the correlation function used by Bell fails to incorporate phase correlations at source. It is the use of such an unphysical correlation function, and not failure of locality, that leads to the Bell’s inequalities.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0321-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is solved numerically for the case of a Gaussian wave packet incident on a time-varying potential barrier. The time evolving reﬂection and transmission probabilities of the wave packet are computed for several different time-dependent boundary conditions obtained by reducing or increasing the height of the potential barrier. We show that in the case when the barrier height is reduced to zero, a time interval is found during which the reﬂection probability is larger (superarrivals) compared to the unperturbed case. We further show that the transmission probability exhibits superarrivals when the barrier is raised from zero to a ﬁnite value of its height. Superarrivals could be understood by ascribing the features of a real physical ﬁeld to the Schrödinger wave function which acts as a carrier through which a disturbance, resulting from the boundary condition being perturbed, propagates from the barrier to the detectors measuring reﬂected and transmitted probabilities. The speed of propagation of this effect depends upon the rate of reducing or raising the barrier height, thus suggesting an application for secure information transfer using superarrivals.</p>

					<p>Recently Auberson, Mahoux, Roy and Singh have proved a long standing conjecture of Roy and Singh: In $2N$-dimensional phase space, a maximally realistic quantum mechanics can have quantum probabilities of no more than $N + 1$ complete commuting cets (CCS) of observables coexisting as marginals of one positive phase space density. Here I formulate a stationary principle which gives a nonperturbative deﬁnition of a maximally classical as well as maximally realistic phase space density. I show that the maximally classical trajectories are in fact exactly classical in the simple examples of coherent states and bound states of an oscillator and Gaussian free particle states. In contrast, it is known that the de Broglie–Bohm realistic theory gives highly nonclassical trajectories.</p>

Further, we show how, by exploiting certain freedom in the Wootters–Fields construction, the task of explicitly writing down such bases can be simpliﬁed for the case when $p$ is an odd prime. In particular, we express the results entirely in terms of the character vectors of the cyclic group $G$ of order $p$. We also analyse the connection between mutually unbiased bases and the representations of $G$.</p>

					<p>A classical phase space with a suitable symplectic structure is constructed together with functions which have Poisson brackets algebraically identical to the Lie algebra structure of the Lie group SU(3). It is shown that in this phase space there are two spheres which intersect at one point. Such a system has a representation as an algebraic curve of the form $X^{3} +\cdots = 0$ in $\mathscr{C}^{3}$. The curve introduced is singular at the origin in the limit when the radii of the spheres go to zero. A direct connection between the Lie groups SU(3) and a singular curve in $\mathscr{C}^{3}$ is thus established. The key step needed to do this was to treat the Lie group as a quantum system and determine its phase space.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We review certain emergent notions on the nature of space-time from noncommutative geometry and their radical implications. These ideas of space-time are suggested from developments in fuzzy physics, string theory, and deformation quantization. The review focuses on the ideas coming from fuzzy physics. We ﬁnd models of quantum space-time like fuzzy $S^{4}$ on which states cannot be localized, but which ﬂuctuate into other manifolds like CP$^{3}$. New uncertainty principles concerning such lack of localizability on quantum space-times are formulated. Such investigations show the possibility of formulating and answering questions like the probability of ﬁnding a point of a quantum manifold in a state localized on another one. Additional striking possibilities indicated by these developments is the (generic) failure of CPT theorem and the conventional spin-statistics connection. They even suggest that Planck’s ‘constant’ may not be a constant, but an operator which does not commute with all observables. All these novel possibilities arise within the rules of conventional quantum physics, and with no serious input from gravity physics.</p>

The problem of Aharonov–Bohm (AB) oscillations in conductance of a mesoscopic ring is studied. We show that the conductance is symmetric under ﬂux reversal and the visibility of AB oscillations decays to zero as a function of the incoherence parameter, signaling dephasing.

In particular we show that perturbative power corrections resulting from non-zero quark masses considerably alters the size of the non-perturbative power corrections and consequently, signiﬁcantly changes the ﬁtted value of $\alpha_{s}$..</p>

				<title>Bounds on neutrino mixing with exotic singlet neutrinos</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0465-0477</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We examine the effects of mixing induced non-diagonal light–heavy neutrino weak neutral currents on the amplitude for the process $v_{a}\overline{v}_{a}\to ZZ$ (with $a = e$; $\mu$ or $\tau$). By imposing constraint that the amplitude should not exceed the perturbative unitarity limit at high energy $(\sqrt{s}=\Lambda)$, we obtain bounds on light–heavy neutrino mixing parameter $\sin^{2}\theta^{v_{a}}_{L}$ where $\theta^{v_{a}}_{L}$ is the mixing angle. In the case of one heavy neutrino (mass $m_{\xi}$) or mass degenerate heavy neutrinos, for $\Lambda = 1$ TeV, no bound is obtained for $m_{\xi} &lt; 0:50$ TeV. However, $\sin^{2}\theta^{v_{a}}_{L}\leq 3:8\times 10^{-6}$ for $m_{\xi} = 5$ TeV and $\sin^{2} \theta^{v_{a}}_{L}\leq 6.0\times 10^{-8}$ for $m_{\xi} = 10$ TeV. For $\Lambda = \infty$, no constraint is obtained for $m_{\xi} &lt; 0:99$ TeV and $\sin^{2} \theta^{v_{a}}_{L}\leq 3.8\times 10^{-2}$ (for $m_{\xi} = 5$ TeV) and $\sin^{2}\theta^{v_{a}}_{L}\leq 9.6\times 10^{-3}$ (for $m_{\xi} = 10$ TeV).</p>

				<title>Universal relation between spectroscopic constants</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0479-0486</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A universal relation between the Sutherland parameter, $\Delta(= k_{e}r^{2}_{e}/2D_{e})$ and the dimensionless parameter $G (= 8\omega_{e}x_{}e/B_{e})$, has been established using 40 electronic states, which include ground as well as excited states of polar and non-polar molecules. This relation is used to predict the dissociation energy of four lowest electronic states of $S_{2}$ molecule. The respective values for the states $X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$, $a^{1}\Delta_{g}$, $b^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}$ and $B^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{u}$ turn out to be 36557, 31431, 28247 and 13429 cm$^{-1}$, and are in good agreement with the experimental values. Furthermore, metastable states $a^{1}\Delta_{g}$ and $b^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}$ of $S_{2}$ are shown to dissociate into ${}^{3}P_{1}+{}^{3}P_{1}$ as against the dissociation of $X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$ into ${}^{3}P_{2}+{}^{3}P_{1}$. In addition, a relation between Sutherland parameter $\Delta$ and internuclear distance $r_{e}$, viz., $\Delta = 2.2r_{e}$ has been obtained for the ground state of alkali diatomic molecules.</p>

					<p>Kanzaki lattice static method is used to calculate the atomic displacements due to substitutional impurities in 3d (Cr) and 4d (Nb, Mo) metals. Wills and Harrison interatomic potential is used to calculate dynamical matrix and the impurity-induced forces up to second nearest neighbors. The calculated atomic displacements for 3d, 4d and 5d impurities in Cr (V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ta and W), Nb (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zr, Mo, Ta and W) and Mo (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zr, Nb, Ta and W) are tabulated up to 10 NN’s. The strain ﬁeld due to 3d impurities is least in Cr metal while it is larger in Nb and Mo metals. For 4d and 5d impurities the strain is larger in Cr metal than in Nb and Mo hosts. Similar trend is found for relaxation energies also.</p>

					<p>Heusler-like alloy Fe$_{2}$CrAl was prepared and studied. Structure determination was done by X-ray. The structure was found to conform to the B$_{2}$ type. Magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁelds in this sample were studied by the Mössbauer effect. The Mössbauer spectra were recorded over a range of temperature from 40 to 296 K. The Mössbauer spectra showed the co-existence of a paramagnetic part with a magnetic hyperﬁne portion at all recorded temperatures. Even with the distribution in the magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁeld, the average hyperﬁne ﬁeld follows the $(T=T_{c})^{3/2}$ law. The paramagnetic part of the hyperﬁne ﬁeld is explained in terms of the clustering of Cr atoms.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present a realistic scenario of tracking of scalar ﬁelds with varying equation of state. The astrophysical constraints on the evolution of scalar ﬁelds in the physical universe are discussed. The nucleosynthesis and the galaxy formation constraints have been used to put limits on $\Omega_{\phi}$ and estimate $\epsilon$ during cosmic evolution. Interpolation techniques have been applied to estimate $\epsilon\simeq 0.772$ at the present epoch. The epoch of transition from matter to quintessence dominated era and consequent onset of acceleration in cosmic expansion is calculated and taking the lower limit $\Omega^{0}_{n} = 0.2$ as estimated from $SN_{e}I_{a}$ data, it is shown that the supernova observations beyond redshift $z = 1$ would reveal deceleration in cosmic expansion.</p>

					<p>Exotic decay of some heavy nuclei with $Z \geq 100$ formed in heavy ion ‘cold fusion’ reaction were studied taking interacting barrier consisting of Coulomb and proximity potential. Calculated half-life time shows that some modes of decay are well within the present upper limit for measurements $(T_{1/2} &lt; 10^{30}$ s). Cluster formation probabilities are calculated for different clusters within ﬁssion model. It is found that transition from cluster mode to ﬁssion mode take place at mass of the cluster, $A_{2} = 20$ in exotic decay which is comparable with the value $A_{2} = 16$ of Shanmugam et al based on cubic plus Yukawa plus exponential model (CYEM).</p>

					<p>A 2-D multi-wire position sensitive detector for X-ray diffraction and small angle X-ray scattering studies is described. The detector has an active area of 100 mm $\times$ 100 mm and consists of an anode plane with 10 $\mu$m SS wires at 3 mm spacing and a pair of orthogonal cathode readout planes with 25 $\mu$m SS wires placed at 1.5 mm spacing. The position information is obtained using charge division method and recorded using a laboratory built data acquisition system. The resolution and gas gain was measured for 5.9 keV X-rays ($^{55}$Fe-source) as a function of the anode wire voltage and gas pressure. It was observed that the proportional region of the PSD at 100 kPa pressure extended up to a high voltage value of around 1.5 kV and it shifted to high values up to 2 kV for gas pressure of 300 kPa. The energy resolution improved from 18% (FWHM) to 12% with increase in pressure. The spatial resolution of the PSD also showed improvement, with a value of 1.2 mm $\times$ 1.4 mm at 300 kPa gas pressure. A maximum gain of $5\times 10^{4}$ is obtained.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0631-0651</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A modal method is used to calculate the two-dimensional sloshing motion of an inviscid liquid in a rectangular container. The full nonlinear problem is reduced to the solution of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the time varying coefﬁcients in the expansions of the interface and the potential. The effects of capillarity are included in the formulation. The simplicity, generality and power of the method are exhibited not only by recovering the earlier results obtained, for example, by Penney and Price [1], Tadjbakhsh and Keller [2] and Faltinsen et al [3], but also by obtaining new and interesting results of the effects of capillarity and shallow depth, which would be difﬁcult to obtain otherwise. For example, it is found that for the initial interface proﬁle considered here, parasitic capillary waves, borne by the higher number wave modes, are generated for moderate capillarity but disappear for larger values of the parameter. The method can be extended to other simple geometries.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Studies of dielectric relaxation and ac conductivity have been made on three samples of sodium tungsten phosphate glasses over a temperature range of 77–420 K. Complex relative permittivity data have been analyzed using dielectric modulus approach. Conductivity relaxation frequency increases with the increase of temperature. Activation energy for conductivity relaxation has also been evaluated. Measured ac conductivity $(\sigma_{m}(\omega))$ has been found to be higher than $\sigma_{\text{dc}}$ at low temperatures whereas at high temperature $\sigma_{m}(\omega)$ becomes equal to $\sigma_{\text{dc}}$ at all frequencies. The ac conductivity obeys the relation $\sigma_{\text{ac}}(\omega) = A\omega^{S}$ over a considerable range of low temperatures. Values of exponent $S$ are nearly equal to unity at about 78 K and the values decrease non-linearly with the increase of temperature. Values of the number density of states at Fermi level $(N(E_{F}))$ have been evaluated at 80 K assuming values of electron wave function decay constant $\alpha$ to be 0.5 (Å)$^{-1}$. Values of $N(E_{F})$ have the order $10^{20}$ which are well within the range suggested for localized states. Present values of $N(E_{F})$ are smaller than those for tungsten phosphate glasses.</p>

					<p>Excess molar volumes $(V^{E})$ and deviation in isentropic compressibilities $(\Delta\beta_{s})$ have been investigated from the density $\rho$ and speed of sound $u$ measurements of six binary liquid mixtures containing $n$-alkanes over the entire range of composition at 298.15 K. Excess molar volume exhibits inversion in sign in one binary mixture, i.e., n-heptane + n-hexane. Remaining ﬁve binary mixtures, n-heptane + toluene, cyclohexane + n-heptane, cyclohexane + n-hexane, toluene + nhexane and n-decane + n-hexane show negative excess molar volumes over the whole composition range. However, the large negative values of excess molar volume becomes dominant in toluene + n-hexane mixture. Deviation in isentropic compressibility is negative over the whole range of composition in the case of all the six binary mixtures. Existence of speciﬁc intermolecular interactions in the mixtures has been analyzed in terms of excess molar volume and deviation in isentropic compressibility.</p>

					<p>We study the relativistic version of the non-Abelian, longitudinal wave in quark–antiquark plasma reported earlier by Bhat et al [Phys. Rev. \textbf{D39}, 649 (1989)]. We have also relaxed various approximations they made in their analysis. Both the quark and antiquark dynamics are taken in our analysis. The non-linearity arising from non-Abelian ﬁeld as well as from plasma are included. Hence it is an exact longitudinal mode in relativistic quark–antiquark plasma, relevant to the study of quark gluon plasma. We ﬁnd that earlier results are reproduced for non-relativistic and low amplitude oscillations, but are modiﬁed for relativistic or large amplitude waves. Further more, the above results are based on just four ﬁrst-order equations for gauge invariant quantities derived from gauge covariant twelve ﬁrst-order equations.</p>

					<p>Taking Coulomb and proximity potential as interacting barrier for post-scission region we calculated half-life time for different modes of exotic decay treating parent and fragments as spheres and these values are compared with experimental data. We studied the effect of deformation of parent and daughter on half-life time treating emitted cluster as spherical. When deformations are included half-life time values are found to decrease, though slightly. It is found that parent deformation alone will not produce appreciable change in half-life time since it affects relatively small pre-scission part of the barrier.</p>

					<p>The energy shifts and intensity ratios of different L X-ray components in tantalum element due to 10 MeV carbon and 12 MeV nitrogen ions are estimated. From the observed energy shifts, the possible number of simultaneous vacancies in M shell are estimated. A comparison of L$_{\alpha}$/L$_{\beta 2,15}$, L$_{\beta 1}$/L$_{\gamma 1}$ and L$_{\gamma 2,3}$/L$_{\gamma 4,4}$ with the ratios due to Scoﬁeld theoretical transition rates indicate that the number of multiple vacancies in N shell are higher than the vacancies in M and O shell. Employing Larkin’s statistical scaling procedure, the number of possible multiple vacancies in N and O shells are estimated quantitatively.</p>

				<title>Inﬂuence of molecules with chloro group on the associative liquid methanol: A dielectric relaxation approach</title>
				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0693-0699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dielectric relaxation parameters, viz., static dielectric constant, $\epsilon$, and relaxation times, $\tau$, have been determined for chlorobenzene–methanol (CB–MET), 1,2 dichloro ethane–methanol (DE–MET) and dimethylene chloride–methanol (DC–MET) mixtures with thirteen different concentrations at three temperatures, viz., 15, 25 and $45^{\circ}$C. The experimental technique used for this work was the time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) in the frequency range of 10 MHz to 20 GHz using the Hewlett Packard HP 54750 sampling oscilloscope. The information regarding hydrogen bonding structural behavior in MET due to CB, DE and DC are obtained by using the theoretical models based on the excess properties. The data suggest that CB and DE are not inﬂuenced by hydrogen bonding in MET whereas DC is inﬂuenced by the hydrogen bonding mechanism in MET. It appears that the behavior of DC on MET is different from CB and DE in MET.</p>

				<title>6.4 GHz ECR ion source at VECC</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0775-0780</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 6.4 GHz ECR ion source that was indigenously developed a few years ago has been operating continuously for injecting oxygen and neon beams to the cyclotron since 1997. VEC-ECR is a single stage high magnetic ﬁeld ion source provided with a negatively biased electron repeller placed on the axis, near the injection mirror point. The supply of cold electrons and use of low mass mixing gas improve the stability of ECR plasma. Very recently, the effect of aluminum oxide coating on the copper plasma chamber wall has been studied. The plasma chamber wall was coated with aluminum by vacuum evaporation method and then exposed to oxygen gas to form aluminum oxide. It was noticed that the process substantially shifts the charge state distribution to the higher charge state with an enhancement of ion current by an order of magnitude. With the aluminized plasma chamber, the VEC-ECR can now produce 12 $\mu$A of O$^{7+}$, 6.5 $\mu$A of Ar$^{12+}$, 1.5 $\mu$A of Kr$^{20+}$ and 1.0 $\mu$A of Xe$^{31+}$.</p>

				<title>Concept of multipole magnetic ﬁeld rotation in ECRIS</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0781-0794</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The conventional type of magnetic well is formed by superposition of two types of magnetic ﬁeld, axial bumpy ﬁeld and radial multipole ﬁeld. It is used to contain plasma that consists of neutrals, ions and electrons. These particles are in constant motion in the well and energetic electrons create plasma by violent collisions with neutrals and ions. The conﬁned electrons are constantly heated by ECR technique in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld. In this paper it has been shown theoretically that how the electron motion is inﬂuenced in terms of heating, containment and azimuthal uniformity of plasma, by the axial rotation of the multipole magnetic ﬁeld [1,2]. Afterwards, the feasibility of achieving a rotating magnetic multipole ﬁeld is discussed to some extent. And it is seen that it is not beyond the capability of the scientiﬁc community in the present scenario of the advanced technology. Presently, it can be achieved for lesser ﬁeld and slightly larger size of the multipole electromagnet and can be used for improvement of the ECR ion source (ECRIS).</p>

					<p>Mass analyzed highly charged ion beams of energy ranging from a few keV to a few MeV plays an important role in various aspects of research in modern physics. In this paper a unique low energy ion beam facility (LEIBF) set up at Nuclear Science Centre (NSC) for providing low and medium energy multiply charged ion beams ranging from a few keV to a few MeV for research in materials sciences, atomic and molecular physics is described. One of the important features of this facility is the availability of relatively large currents of multiply charged positive ions from an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) source placed entirely on a high voltage platform. All the electronic and vacuum systems related to the ECR source including 10 GHz ultra high frequency (UHF) transmitter, high voltage power supplies for extractor and Einzel lens are placed on a high voltage platform. All the equipments are controlled using a personal computer at ground potential through optical ﬁbers for high voltage isolation. Some of the experimental facilities available are also described.</p>

					<p>A superconducting linear accelerator (LINAC) to boost the energy of the heavy ion beams from the 14 UD pelletron accelerator at Mumbai is under development. The booster is based on quarter wave resonators (QWR) coated with lead which is superconducting at liquid helium temperature. The operating frequency is 150 MHz. Four resonators each are mounted in a cryostat module built indigenously. A total of seven such modules arranged in two arms with an isochronous and achromatic beam bend in the middle comprises the full LINAC. The transverse focusing of the beam through the LINAC is carried out using periodic quadrupole doublet magnets operating at room temperature. The present status of the project is described.</p>

					<p>A proposal has been prepared to upgrade the LINAC at ANU, using re-plated PbSn split loop resonators performing at 3.6 MV/m, and the addition of two- and three-stub resonators. The system is designed to provide 6 MeV/a.m.u. $^{107}$Ag starting with gas-stripped beam from the 14 UD, which is then foil-stripped before the LINAC. No major changes to the beam optics components will be required other than addition of a large bore rebuncher in the middle of the 180$^{\circ}$ achromat. Models of the two- and three-stub resonators have been built and optimized for the goal frequency, for the separation of accelerating and other modes as well as for the minimization of the current in the demountable joints. A copper prototype has been constructed and is being plated with PbSn for cold testing.</p>

				<title>Preliminary design of high-power wave-guide/transmission system for multimegawatt CW requirements of 100 MeV proton LINAC</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0829-0834</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Development of a 100 MeV CW proton LINAC has been planned at CAT. This LINAC will be needing CW rf power in the frequency ranges of 350 MHz and 700 MHz for its RFQ and DTL/CCDTL/SFDTL structures respectively. The power to the accelerating structures will be produced by either 1 MW CW or 250 kW CW klystrons/inductive output tubes (HOM IOTs). The power needed by respective feed points in the structure is max. 250 kW which will be powered by splitting the power from 1 MW klystron/klystrode into four channels by using a wave-guide system. In case of using 250 kW tubes the power to the structures will be provided directly from each tube. Two types of wave-guide transmission system have been considered, viz, WR 2300 for 350 MHz rf needs and WR 1500 for 700 MHz rf needs. The typical wave-guide system has been designed using the 1 MW CW klystron followed by wave-guide ﬁlter, dual directional coupler, high-power circulator, three 3 dB magic TEE power dividers to split the main channel into four equal channels of 250 kW each. Each individual channel has dual directional couplers, ﬂexible wave-guide sections and high power ceramic vacuum window. The circulator and each power divider is terminated into the isolated ports by high power CW loads. Out of the four channels three channels have phase shifters. Present paper describes the technological aspects and design speciﬁcations-considerations for these stringent requirements.</p>

					<p>A specialized rf-accelerator system HSI consisting of two RFQ’s and 8 rf seven-gap cavities was built for injection of high intensities of singly charged heavy ions into the Heidelberg heavy ion storage ring TSR. With different ion sources, this system now is used to deliver positive or negative, atomic and molecular ion beams with energies between 150 keV/a.m.u. and 5.3 MeV/a.m.u. ﬁnal energy.</p>
					<p>For a future replacement of the MP-tandem-postaccelerator-system the new HSI-accelerator is to be equipped with an ECR source for high intensities of highly charged ions. An advanced commercial ECR source with a 18 GHz rf klystron and an adjustable extraction system for adaption of a wide range of injection energies has been commissioned at the manufacturer and is delivered. Test bench operation presently is in preparation at Heidelberg. A stripper section with an achromatic charge state selector is under construction between injector and postaccelerator. Other ion sources, e.g., for ultra cold $H^{+}_{3}$ molecular ion beams are under development.</p>

				<title>Preliminary design studies of a 100 MeV H$^{-}$/H$^{+}$ LINAC as injector for SNS synchrotron/ADS LINAC</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0859-0869</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is proposed to construct a spallation neutron source (SNS) at Centre for Advanced Technology (CAT) based on a 1 GeV proton synchrotron with 100 MeV H$^{-}$ LINAC as injector. Additionally, the LINAC can form the ﬁrst 100 MeV part of a 1 GeV proton LINAC to be built in future for accelerator driven system (ADS) applications. We are exploring a conﬁguration of the 100 MeV LINAC which will consist of an H$^{-}$ ion source, a 4–6 MeV RFQ followed either by a 20 MeV drift tube LINAC (DTL) and 100 MeV separated function drift tube LINAC (SDTL) or a coupled cavity drift tube LINAC (CCDTL) structure. In this paper, we present the results of our preliminary physics design studies of the RFQ–SDTL, RFQ–CCDTL and RFQ–DTL–SDTL conﬁgurations. The design of the 4.5 MeV RFQ is discussed along with the matching sections between the RFQ–SDTL/DTL and RFQ–CCDTL. The choice of the accelerator conﬁguration and that of various parameters of the individual accelerator structures under consideration are discussed. The design objectives are to arrive at a conﬁguration which eases heat removal for CW operation and which is less prone to halo formation in order to reduce the beam loss at higher energies.</p>

				<title>Production, installation and test of Nb-sputtered QWRs for ALPI</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0871-0880</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eight cryostats, each housing 4 sputtered Nb/Cu, 160 MHz, quarter wave resonators (QWR), are now in operation in ALPI [1]. Two of them house high $\beta$ cavities; the others are equipped with medium $\beta$ resonators. Another medium $\beta$ cryostat is ready and will be installed in the early 2002. Pb/Cu medium $\beta$ accelerating cavities are now present only in four cryostats and they will have their Pb superconducting (SC) layer replaced by sputtered Nb soon.</p>
					<p>The substitution of the Pb SC layer in ALPI medium $\beta$ resonators did not interfere with ALPI operation; the upgrading of resonators went on parallel to the cryostat maintenance programme. The average accelerating ﬁeld of these resonators, at the design power of 7 W, overcomes 4 MV/m, whereas, when Pb electroplated, their average value was 2.7 MV/m. The sputtered resonator combines the good SC characteristics of Nb with the higher thermal conductivity and better stability to change of He bath pressure, which is typical of copper resonators. This leads to a very high reliability, as routinely experienced during beam acceleration.</p>

				<title>First on-line test of the LINAC superbuncher at Nuclear Science Centre</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0881-0884</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An on-line test of the LINAC superbuncher at Nuclear Science Centre has been successfully performed. DC O$^{7+}$ beam of nominal energy 92 MeV was accelerated through the superbuncher resonator, operating at a ﬁeld of 4.54 MV/m. The total energy gain of the beam was measured to be 4.5 MeV. For the pulsed beam test a phase locked bunched beam of O$^{7+}$ of nominal energy 92 MeV, FWHM 1.3 ns from the pre-tandem multiharmonic buncher was injected into the superbuncher. By properly adjusting the phase and amplitude of the resonator, the best FWHM of the bunched beam was measured to be 185 ps near the entrance of the ﬁrst LINAC module. Fully depleted cooled surface barrier detector was used for measuring the time width. In a separate experiment the intrinsic time resolution of the same detector was measured to be 134 ps. Consequently the intrinsic time width of the bunched beam, after correcting for the detector resolution, would be 127 ps. Details of the experiment and results are presented.</p>

				<title>Beam dynamics studies in the driver LINAC pre-stripper section of the RIA facility</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0885-0894</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The RIA facility driver LINAC consists of about 400 superconducting (SC) independently phased rf cavities. The LINAC is designed to accelerate simultaneously several charge-state beams to generate as much as 400 kW of uranium beam power. The LINAC beam dynamics is most sensitive to the focusing and accelerating structure parameters of the pre-stripper section, where the uranium beam is accelerated from 0.17 keV/u to 9.4 MeV/u. This section is designed to accept and accelerate two charge states (28 and 29) of uranium beam from an ECR ion source. The pre-stripper section must be designed to minimize the beam emittance distortion of this two-charge-state beam. In particular, the inter-cryostat spaces must be minimized and beam parameters near transitions of the accelerating and focusing lattices must be matched carefully. Several sources of possible effective emittance growth are considered in the design of the pre-stripper section and a tolerance budget is established. Numerical beam dynamics studies include realistic electric and magnetic three-dimensional ﬁeld distributions in the SC rf cavities and SC solenoids. Error effects in the longitudinal beam parameters are studied.</p>

				<title>Heavy-ion LINAC development for the US RIA project</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0895-0913</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Nuclear Science Community in the Unites States has unanimously concluded that developments in both nuclear science and its supporting technologies make building a world-leading Rare-Isotope Accelerator (RIA) facility for production of radioactive beams the top priority. The RIA development effort involves several US Laboratories (ANL, JLAB, LBNL, MSU, ORNL). The RIA facility includes a CW 1.4 GeV driver LINAC and a 100 MV post-accelerator both based on superconducting (SC) cavities operating at frequencies from 48 MHz to 805 MHz. An initial acceleration in both LINACs is provided by room temperature RFQs. The driver LINAC is designed for acceleration of any ion species; from protons up to 900 MeV to uranium up to 400 MeV/u. The novel feature of the driver LINAC is an acceleration of multiple charge-state heavy-ion beams in order to achieve 400 kW beam power. Basic design concepts of the driver LINAC are given. Several new conceptual solutions in beam dynamics, room temperature and SC accelerating structures for heavy ion accelerator applications are discussed.</p>

				<title>MAFF – The Munich accelerator for ﬁssion fragments</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0915-0921</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At the new high ﬂux reactor FRM-II in Munich the accelerator MAFF (Munich accelerator for ﬁssion fragments) is under design. In the high neutron ﬂux of 10$^{14}$ n/cm$^{2}$ s up to 10$^{14}$ neutron-rich ﬁssion fragments per second are produced in the 1 g U-235 target. Ions with an energy of 30 keV are extracted from the ion source. In the mass seperator two isotopes can be selected. One of the beams is used for low energy experiments, the other one is injected into an ECRIS (or EBIS) for charge breeding to a $q/A \geq 0.16$. A gas ﬁlled RFQ cooler is used for emittance improvement. The subsequent LINAC delivers beams with an energy ranging from 3.7 MeV/u to 5.9 MeV/u. New IH structures are being developed at the Munich tandem laboratory. A small storage ring is planned in a further stage to recycle the ﬁssion fragments. A thin target foil can be placed into this ring, e.g., for synthesis of super-heavy elements. The through-going beam tube has been installed in the heavy water tank of the reactor. Tests of the target ion source in a special oven to test long term stability and safety tests were in progress.</p>

				<title>Design of 57.5 MHz CW RFQ structure for the Rare Isotope Accelarator Facility</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0977-0988</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) facility includes a driver LINAC for production of 400 kW CW heavy-ion beams. The initial acceleration of heavy ions delivered from an ECR ion source can be effectively performed by a 57.5 MHz 4 m long RFQ. The principal speciﬁcations of the RFQ are: (1) formation of extremely low longitudinal emittance; (2) stable operation over a wide range of voltage for acceleration of various ion species needed for RIA operation; (3) simultaneous acceleration of two-charge states of uranium ions.</p>
					<p>CW operation of an accelerating structure leads to a number of requirements for the resonators such as high shunt impedance, efﬁcient water cooling of all parts of the resonant cavity, mechanical stability together with precise alignment, reliable rf contacts, a stable operating mode and ﬁne tuning of the resonant frequency during operation. To satisfy these requirements a new resonant structure has been developed.</p>
					<p>This paper discusses beam dynamics and electrodynamics design of the RFQ cavity, as well as, some aspects of the mechanical design of this low-frequency CW RFQ.</p>

				<title>An improved injector bunching geometry for ATLAS</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0989-0995</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The bunching system of the ATLAS positive ion injector (PII) has been improved by relocating the harmonic buncher to a point signiﬁcantly closer to the second stage sine-wave buncher and the injector LINAC. The longitudinal optics design has also been modiﬁed and now employs a virtual waist from the harmonic buncher feeding the second stage sine-wave buncher. This geometry improves the handling of space charge for high-current beams, signiﬁcantly increases the capture fraction into the primary rf bucket and reduces the capture fraction of the unwanted parasitic rf bucket. Total capture and transport through the PII has been demonstrated as high as 80% of the injected dc beam while the population of the parasitic, unwanted rf bucket is typically less than 3% of the total transported beam. To remove this small residual parasitic component a new traveling-wave transmission-line chopper has been developed reducing both transverse and longitudinal emittance growth from the chopping process. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract W-31-109-ENG-38.</p>

					<p>The beam optics of a multi-sample sputter ion source, based on the NEC MCSNICS, has been modiﬁed to accommodate cathode voltages higher than 5 kV and dispenses with the nominal extractor. The cathode voltage in Cs sputter sources plays the role of the classical extractor accomplishing the acceleration of beam particles from eV to keV energy, minimizing space charge effects and interactions between the beam and residual gas. The higher the cathode voltage, the smaller are these contributions to the emittance growth. The higher cathode voltage also raises the Child’s law limit on the Cs current resulting in substantially increased output. The incidental focusing role of the extractor is reallocated to a deceleration Einzel lens and the velocity change needed to match to the pre-acceleration tube goes to a new electrode at the tube entrance. All electrodes are large enough to ensure that the beam ﬁlls less than 30% of the aperture to minimize aberrations. The improvements are applicable to sputter sources generally.</p>

				<page>1007-1018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New developments of beam diagnostic devices and methods at the cooler synchrotron and storage ring COSY at the Forschungszentrum J¨ulich are described. A Schottky-pickup was tested and installed. The new pickup consists of four diagonally arranged plates which can be combined by means of relays to measure either in the horizontal or in the vertical plane. A new method for resonant tuning of the Schottky-pickup for transversal measurements was realized. A tune meter was developed for real-time tune measurements in the acceleration ramp and is used as routine diagnostic tool. Based on the developed bunch synchronous tracking generator an on-line phase space measurement was realized. For beam proﬁle measurements a residual-gas ionization beam proﬁle monitor was installed in the COSY-ring and tested. To measure the beam quality in case of fast and slow extraction a universal spill detector was developed and tested in the extraction beam line.</p>

				<title>A controller for 97 MHz super-conducting QWR for NSC LINAC booster</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1035-1040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A resonator controller has been implemented to stabilize the amplitude and phase of rf ﬁelds in the super-conducting resonators of NSC LINAC. Due to reduced losses these resonators have intrinsic band width of the order of 0.1 Hz at 97 MHz whereas the vibration-induced center frequency changes are of the order of a few tens of hertz. In the control strategy followed, the resonator is made the frequency selective part of an oscillator. The phase lock is achieved by dynamically adding a phase shift in the oscillator. A slow tuner minimizes the slow drifts in the resonator center frequency. In this paper we present the control strategy, implementation details and performance obtained with this controller.</p>

				<title>Accelerator mass spectrometry of the heaviest long-lived radionuclides with a 3-MV tandem accelerator</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1041-1051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A 3-MV pelletron tandem accelerator is the heart of the Vienna environmental research accelerator (VERA). The original design of the beam transport components allows the transport of ions of all elements, from the lightest to the heaviest. For light ions the suppression of neighboring masses was sufﬁcient to measure isotopic ratios of $^{14}$C/$^{12}$C and $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al as low as 10$^{-15}$ and $^{10}$Be/$^{9}$Be down to 10$^{-13}$. To suppress neighboring masses for the heaviest radionuclides in the energy range of 10–20 MeV, the resolution of VERA was increased both by improving the ion optics of existing elements at the injection side and by installing a new high-resolution electrostatic separator at the high-energy side. Interfering ions which pass all beam ﬁlters are identiﬁed with a Bragg-type ionization detector and a high-resolution time-of-ﬂight system. Two ultra-thin diamond-like carbon (DLC) foils are used in the start and stop detector, which substantially reduces losses due to beam straggling. This improved set up enables us to measure even the heaviest long-lived radionuclides, where stable isobaric interferences are absent (e.g. $^{236}$U and $^{244}$Pu), down to environmental levels. Moreover, the advantage of a ‘small’ and well manageable machine like VERA lies in its higher stability and reliability which allows to measure these heavy radionuclides more accurately, and also a large number of samples.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1053-1059</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Depth proﬁling measurements of tritium in carbon samples have been performed during the past seven years at the AMS facility installed at the Rossendorf 3 MV Tandetron. The samples have been cut from the inner walls of the fusion experiments ASDEX-upgrade/Garching and JET/Culham. The tritium content of the samples from JET required a dedicated AMS facility to prevent any contamination of the versatile 3 MV Tandetron. On the basis of an air-insulated 100 kV tandem accelerator equipped with a gas stripper an AMS facility exclusively devoted to tritium depth proﬁling was installed, tested and used for routine measurements. After additional successful tests employing diamond-like carbon (DLC) stripper foils at this accelerator, another small and compact 100 kV tandem accelerator with SF$_{6}$ insulation and a DLC stripper has been installed at the AMS facility. Results obtained with the different tandem accelerators are presented.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1061-1073</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A high resolution injector system has recently been installed at the Lund 3 MV tandem Pelletron accelerator. The new injector, designed mainly for 26Al ions, will increase the experimental potential of the Lund AMS facility considerably. High quality energy- and mass-resolution is obtained by using a 90$^{\circ}$ spherical electrostatic analyzer followed by a 90$^{\circ}$ magnetic analyzer. The injector is equipped with a high intensity sputtering source with a spherical ionizer.</p>
					<p>A new analytical technique for acceptance calculations as well as PC-based computational methods have been used in the design of the ion optical system of the new injector.</p>
					<p>Compared to our old injector system which has a magnetic analyzer with a bending angle of only 15$^{\circ}$, the new system has a more than ten times better resolution. The beam optics of the new system is also better designed to match the accelerator acceptance. In this way the ion transmission from the ion source to the detector, for different ions of interest in our AMS programme, has been increased.</p>

				<title>Classical stochastic approach to cosmology revisited</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The classical stochastic model of cosmology recently developed by us is reconsidered. In that approach the parameter $w$ deﬁned by the equation of state $p = w\rho$ was taken to be ﬂuctuating with mean zero and we compared the theoretical probability distribution function (PDF) for the Hubble parameter with observational data corresponding to a universe with matter and vacuum energy. Even though qualitative agreement between the two was obtained, an attempt is herein made to introduce a more realistic assumption for the mean ofwand use it for the calculations. In the present theory the mean values of both $p$ and $w$ are taken to be nonzero. The theoretical and observational PDFs are compared for different epochs and values of the Hubble parameter. The corresponding values of the diffusion constant $D$ obtained are approximately constant. We use the scatter in the observed redshift-magnitude data of Type Ia supernova to place limits on the stochastic variation in expansion rate and consequently, on the stochastic variation of the equation of state.</p>

				<page>0011-0019</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we attempt to obtain the nature of the external ﬁeld such that the Dirac equation with external electro-magnetic ﬁeld is invariant. The Poincar´e group, which is the maximal symmetry group for ﬁeld free case, is constrained by the presence of the external ﬁeld. Introducing inﬁnitesimal transformation of x andψ, we apply Lie’s extended group method to obtain the class of external ﬁeld which admit of the invariance of the equation. It is important to note that the constraints for the existence of invariance are explicity on the electric and magnetic ﬁeld, though only potentials explicity appears in the equation.</p>

				<title>Cosmological constant in the Bianchi type-I-modiﬁed Brans–Dicke cosmology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0021-0027</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In 1961, Brans and Dicke [1] provided an interesting alternative to general relativity based on Mach’s principle. To understand the reasons leading to their ﬁeld equations, we ﬁrst consider homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models in the Brans–Dicke theory. Accordingly we start with the Robertson–Walker line element and the energy tensor of a perfect ﬂuid. The scalar ﬁeld $\phi$ is now a function of the cosmic time only.</p>
					<p>Then we consider spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I-cosmological solutions of modiﬁed Brans–Dicke theory containing barotropic ﬂuid. These have been obtained by imposing a condition on the cosmological parameter $\Lambda(\phi)$. Again we try to focus the meaning of this cosmological term and to relate it to the time coordinate which gives us a collapse singularity or the initial singularity. On the other hand, our solution is a generalization of the solution found by Singh and Singh [2]. As far as we are aware, such solution has not been given earlier.</p>

				<page>0029-0045</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lagrangian density of riccions is obtained with the quartic self-interacting potential using higher-derivative gravitational action in $(4+D)$-dimensional space-time with $S^{D}$ as a compact manifold. It is found that the resulting four-dimensional theory for riccions is one-loop multiplicatively renormalizable. Renormalization group equations are solved and its solutions yield many interesting results such as (i) dependence of extra dimensions on the enegy mass scale showing that these dimensions increase with the increasing mass scale up to $D = 6$, (ii) phase transition at $3.05\times 10^{16}$ GeV and (iii) dependence of gravitational and other coupling constants on energy scale. Results also suggest that space-time above $3.05\times 10^{16}$ GeV should be fractal. Moreover, dimension of the compact manifold decreases with the decreasing energy mass scale such that $D = 1$ at the scale of the phase transition. Results imply invisiblity of $S^{1}$ at this scale (which is $3.05\times 10^{16}$ GeV).</p>

				<title>The phenomenon of nucleon emission at high angular momentum states of fused compound systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0075-0093</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nucleon emission from high spin fused compound systems is analyzed in the framework of the statistical theory of hot rotating (STHR) nuclei. This is an elaborate version of our earlier work and we present our results for $^{156}$Er, $^{166}$Er, $^{168}$Yb and $^{188}$Hg. We predict an increase in neutron emission for $^{166}$Er due to the abrupt decrease in neutron separation energy around $I \approx 55\hbar$. Since the drop in the separation energy is closely associated with the structural changes in the rotating nuclei, relative increase in neutron emission probability around certain values of angular momentum may be construed as evidence for the shape transition. A similar effect is predicted for $^{168}$Yb around $I \approx 55\hbar$. We also extend the microscopic cranked Nilsson method (CNM) to hot nuclear systems and compare the results with that of the STHR method. The two methods yield different results for triaxially deformed nuclei although for biaxial deformations the results are identical. This is illustrated for $^{186}$Hg.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0099-0107</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Transverse ﬂow transversely excited (TFTE) CO$_{2}$ lasers are easily scalable to multikilowatt level. The laser power can be scaled up by increasing the volumetric gas ﬂow and discharge volume. It was observed in a TFTE CW CO$_{2}$ laser having single row of pins as an anode and tubular cathode that the laser power was not increasing when the discharge volume and the gas volumetric ﬂow were increased by increasing the electrode separation keeping the gas ﬂow velocity constant. The discharge voltage too remained almost constant with the change of electrode separation at the same gas ﬂow velocity. This necessitated revision of the scaling laws for designing this type of high power CO$_{2}$ laser. Experimental results of laser performance for different electrode separations are discussed and the modiﬁcations in the scaling laws are presented.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of the fast electron emission produced during the cleavage of crystals</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0109-0122</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper reports the fast electron emission produced during the cleavage of alkali halide crystals and models the dynamics of the process. The mechano-emission arises as a result of the ionization of surface traps at the expense of the energy which is released in the annihilation of the defects which are formed during cleavage. The slow electrons which appear upon the ionization of surface traps are subsequently accelerated in the ﬁeld of negatively charged segment of the freshly cleaved surface. Considering the basic mechanism of fast electron emission, expressions are derived which are able to explain satisfactorily the temporal, thermal, charge, surface, coloration, water adsorption and other characteristics of the fast electron emission produced during the cleavage of crystals. The decay time of the charges on the newly created surfaces, and the velocity of cracks can be determined from the measurements of fast electron emission produced during the cleavage of crystals. It is shown that two types of diffusing centres are responsible for the charge relaxation and thereby for the emission of fast electrons produced during the cleavage of alkali halide crystals.</p>

The effective ion–ion interaction potential due to Wills and Harrison is used to evaluate dynamical matrix and the impurity-induced forces. The results for atomic displacements due to 3d, 4d and 5d impurities (Fe, Co, Cu, Nb, Mo, Pd, Pt and Au) in Ni and (Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Nb, Mo, Pt and Au) impurities in Pd are given up to 25 NN’s of impurity and these are compared with the available experimental data. The maximum displacements of 4.6% and 3.8% of 1NN distance are found for NiNb and PdNb alloys respectively, while the minimum displacements of 0.63% and 0.23% of 1NN distance are found for NiFe and PdFe alloys respectively. Except for Cu, the atomic displacements are found to be proportional to the core radii and d state radius. The relaxation energies for 3d impurities are found less than those for 4d and 5d impurities in Ni and Pd metals. Therefore, 3d impurities may easily be solvable in these metals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Neutron emission cross section for various elements from $^{9}$Be to $^{209}$Bi have been calculated using the hybrid model code ALICE-91 for proton induced reactions in the energy range 25 MeV to 105 MeV. An empirical expression relating neutron emission cross section to target mass number and incident proton energy has been obtained. The simple expression reduces the computation time signiﬁcantly. The trend in the variation of neutron emission cross sections with respect to the target mass number and incident proton energy has been discussed within the framework of the model used.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The embedded-atom method have been applied to study the strain ﬁeld produced by the self-interstitial impurity at the octahedral site in Ni. The calculation have been carried out consistently on the basis of discrete lattice theory, using Kanzaki method. The atomic force constants are evaluated using Wills and Harrison interatomic potential. The dynamical matrix and external force are evaluated considering the interaction up to ﬁrst nearest neighbors. The atomic displacements are tabulated up to 20NN’s. These displacements are of oscillatory nature and of decreasing magnitude with NN’s distance. The physical properties such as self-interstitial formation energy and volume change calculated using atomic displacements are in accordance with the earlier studies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The large hadron collider (LHC) should have the ability to detect supersymmetric particles if low-energy supersymmetry solves the hierarchy problem. Studies of the LHC detection reach, and the ability to measure properties of supersymmetric particles are currently underway. We highlight some of these, such as the reach in minimal supergravity space and correlation with a ﬁne-tuning parameter, precision measurements of edge variables, anomaly- or gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Supersymmetry with baryon-number violation seems at ﬁrst glance more difﬁcult to detect, but proves to be possible by using leptons from cascade decays.</p>

					<p>The highest energy cosmic rays observed possess macroscopic energies and their origin is likely to be associated with the most energetic processes in the universe. Their existence triggered a ﬂurry of theoretical explanations ranging from conventional shock acceleration to particle physics beyond the standard model (SM) and processes taking place at the earliest moments of our universe. Furthermore, many new experimental activities promise a strong increase of statistics at the highest energies and a combination with $\gamma$-ray and neutrino astrophysics will put strong constraints on these theoretical models. We give an overview over this quickly evolving research ﬁeld with focus on testing new particle physics.</p>

				<title>Probing grand uniﬁcation with fermion masses, neutrino oscillations and proton decay</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0291-0336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is noted that a set of facts points to the relevance in four dimensions of conventional supersymmetric uniﬁcation based on minimally a string-uniﬁed $G(224)$ symmetry, or maximally $SO(10)$. These include: (i) the observed family structure, (ii) quantization of electric charge, (iii) meeting of the three gauge couplings, (iv) neutrino oscillations (in particular the value of $\Delta m^{2}(v_{\mu}-v_{\tau})$, suggested by SuperK), (v) the intricate pattern of the masses and mixings of the fermions, including the smallness of $V_{cb}$ and the largeness of $\theta^{\text{osc}}_{v_{\mu}v_{\tau}}$, and (vi) the need for B–L as a generator to implement baryogenesis (via leptogenesis). A concrete proposal is presented within a predictive $SO(10)/G(224)$ framework that successfully describes the masses and mixings of all fermions, including the neutrinos – with eight predictions, all in agreement with observation. Within this framework, a systematic study of proton decay is carried out, which (a) pays special attention to its dependence on the fermion masses, (b) limits the threshold corrections so as to preserve natural coupling uniﬁcation, and (c) uses recently improved values of the matrix element and renormalization effects. Allowing for both minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and its proposed variant, the so-called extended supersymmetric standard model (ESSM), as effective low-energy theories, the study shows that a conservative upper limit on the proton lifetime is about $(1/3–2)\times 10^{34}$ years, with $\overline{v}K^{+}$ being the dominant decay mode, and quite possibly $\mu^{+}K^{0}$ and $e^{+}\pi^{0}$ being prominent. This in turn strongly suggests that an improvement in the current sensitivity by a factor of ﬁve to ten ought to reveal proton decay. For comparison, some alternatives to the conventional approach to uniﬁcation pursued here are mentioned at the end.</p>

				<title>Maximum stellar iron core mass</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0415-0422</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An analytical method of estimating the mass of a stellar iron core, just prior to core collapse, is described in this paper. The method employed depends, in part, upon an estimate of the true relativistic mass increase experienced by electrons within a highly compressed iron core, just prior to core collapse, and is signiﬁcantly different from a more typical Chandrasekhar mass limit approach. This technique produced a maximum stellar iron core mass value of $2.69\times 10^{30}$ kg (1.35 solar masses). This mass value is very near to the typical mass values found for neutron stars in a recent survey of actual neutron star masses. Although slightly lower and higher neutron star masses may also be found, lower mass neutron stars are believed to be formed as a result of enhanced iron core compression due to the weight of non-ferrous matter overlying the iron cores within large stars. And, higher mass neutron stars are likely to be formed as a result of fallback or accretion of additional matter after an initial collapse event involving an iron core having a mass no greater than $2.69\times 10^{30}$ kg.</p>

The differential size spectra at different atmospheric depths show a systematic shift of the knee towards smaller shower size with the increase in atmospheric depth. The measured values of spectral indices at below and above the knee are $-2.45\pm 0.03$ and $-2.91\pm 0.05$ respectively. Measurements at different atmospheric depths correspond to the same values within the error limits both for below and above the knee.

					<p>Neutron multiplicity per incident proton, $n/p$, in collision of high energy proton beam with voluminous Pb and W targets has been estimated from the Dubna Cascade Code and compared with the available experimental data for the purpose of benchmarking of the code. Contributions of various atomic and nuclear processes for heat production and isotopic yield of secondary nuclei are also estimated to assess the heat and radioactivity conditions of the targets. Results obtained from the code show excellent agreement with the experimental data at beam energy, $E &lt; 1.2$ GeV and differ maximum up to 25% at higher energy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>It is assumed that the dynamics of valence electrons of alkali-metal atoms can be well accounted for by a quantum-defect theoretic model while the core electrons may be supposed to move in a self-consistent ﬁeld. This model is used to study the momentum properties of atoms from $^{3}$Li to $^{37}$Rb. The numerical results obtained for the momentum density, moments of momentum density and Compton proﬁle are found to be in good agreement with the results of more detailed conﬁguration-interaction calculations for the atom $^{3}$Li. Similar results for $^{11}$Na, $^{19}$K and $^{37}$Rb are compared with the corresponding Hartree–Fock–Roothaan values only, for want of data from other realistic calculations.</p>

					<p>In the present work, the radiative condensation instability is investigated in the presence of dust charge ﬂuctuations. We ﬁnd that the charge variability of the grain reduces the growth rate of radiative mode only for ﬂuctuation wavelength smaller or of the order of the Debye length and this reduction is not very large. Far from the Debye sphere, radiative mode can damp due to thermal conduction of electrons and ions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>High quality thin ﬁlms of La$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ (LCMO) of different thickness were grown on LAO substrates by pulsed laser deposition (KrF, $\gamma = 278$ nm). The AFM images suggest a two-dimensional step-growth. DC magnetization measurements of the ﬁlms in a ﬁeld of 500 Oe show that the magnetic ordering temperature is the same for all the ﬁlms in both FC and ZFC conditions and is the same as that for the bulk. However, a difference is seen between the FC and ZFC magnetization of the ﬁlms. There seems to be a systematic in this difference with respect to the thickness of the ﬁlm, with the difference decreasing with thickness. We suggest that the difference in the magnetization under FC and ZFC conditions may be due to strain-induced anisotropy arising from the lattice mismatch between the substrate and the ﬁlm or due to the shape anisotropy due to epitaxial growth.</p>

					<p>X-ray diffraction patterns of nanocrystalline Fe–Cu–Nb–Si–B (FINEMET) alloys reveal that bcc $\alpha$-Fe/$\alpha$-FeSi crystallites with the average grain size of 20(5) nm are dispersed in amorphous matrix. Enhanced electron–electron interaction (EEI) and quantum interference (QI) effects as well as electron–magnon (and/or electron-spin ﬂuctuation) scattering turn out to be the main mechanisms that govern the temperature dependence of resistivity. Of all the inelastic scattering processes, inelastic electron–phonon scattering is the most effective mechanism to destroy phase coherence of electron wave functions. The diffusion constant, density of states at the Fermi level and the inelastic scattering time have been estimated, for the ﬁrst time, for the alloys in question.</p>

				<title>Microwave dielectric tangent losses in KDP and DKDP crystals</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0525-0533</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By adding cubic and quartic phonon anharmonic interactions in the pseudospin lattice coupled mode (PLCM) model for KDP-type crystals and using double-time temperature dependent Green’s function method, expressions for soft mode frequency, dielectric constant and dielectric tangent loss are obtained. Using model parameters given by Ganguliet al[9] the dielectric losses are calculated for KDP and DKDP crystals. In the microwave frequency range an increase in frequency (1–35 GHz) is followed by an increase in dielectric tangent loss (1–35) at 98 K and (1–15) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ at 333 K for KDP and DKDP crystals respectively. The dielectric tangent loss decreases from 0.052 to 0.042 for KDP crystals with increase in temperature from 130 to 170 K and for DKDP crystals it decreases from 0.0166 to 0.0074 with an increase in temperature from 230–343 K in their paraelectric phases at 10 GHz. This shows Curie–Weiss behavior of the dielectric tangent loss.</p>

The experimental situations like change of solvents, method of preparation, applied pressure and pressure cycle apart from compositions is analyzed within the framework of tailing of states.

				<abstract>
					<p>The Born–von Karman model is used to calculate phonon density of states (DOS) of nanocrystalline bcc Fe. It is found that there is an anisotropic stiffening in the interatomic force constants and hence there is shrinking in the nearest-neighbour distances in the nanophase. This leads to additional vibrational modes above the bulk phonons near the bottom of the phonon band. It is found that the high energy phonon modes of nanophase Fe are the surface modes. The calculated phonon DOS closely agree with the experimental data except a peak at 37 meV. The calculated phonon dispersion relations are also compared with those of the bulk phonons and anomalous behaviour is discussed in detail. The speciﬁc heat in nanophase enhances as compared to bulk phase at low temperatures and the calculated Debye temperature $\Theta_{D}$ agrees with the experimental results. It is predicted that the nanocrystalline Fe may consist of about 14 GPa pressure.</p>

					<p>In view of the recent observation of nonexponential decay features for a certain quantummechanical system, we revisit our earlier study of the small-time behaviour of the meson–antimeson complex wherein the commonly employed Weisskopf–Wigner approximation could be tested, in principle. We ﬁnd that the experiments for this testing are difﬁcult because of (i) the smallness of the times required for this study, (ii) the high accuracy required for probing the nonleading terms (which distinguish this approximation from the general theory) in the small-time behaviour of the relevant probabilities and (iii) the crude knowledge of the required ‘ﬂavour-tagging’ procedures, as available at present.</p>

On the basis of the present analysis it is shown that the photon spectra measured by WA98 collaboration in Pb + Pb collisions at CERN SPS energies can be explained by both QGP as well as hadronic initial states if the spectral shift of hadrons at ﬁnite temperature is taken into account.

				<page>0711-0723</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Based on general arguments, the in-medium quark propagator in a quark–gluon plasma leads to a quark dispersion relation consisting of two branches, of which one exhibits a minimum at some ﬁnite momentum. This results in a vanishing group velocity for collective quark modes. Important quantities such as the production rate of low mass lepton pairs and mesonic correlators depend inversely on this group velocity. Therefore these quantities, which follow from self energy diagrams containing a quark loop, are strongly affected by van Hove singularities (peaks and gaps). If these sharp structures could be observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions it would reveal the physical picture of the quark–gluon plasma (QGP) as a gas of quasiparticles.</p>

				<title>Flow with photon multiplicity detector: Past and future</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0739-0752</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements of azimuthal distribution of inclusive photons using the ﬁne granularity pre-shower photon multiplicity detector (PMD) at CERN SPS are used to obtain anisotropy in the azimuthal distributions. These results are used to estimate the anisotropy in the neutral pion distributions. The results are compared with results of charged particle data, both for ﬁrst order and second order anisotropy. Assuming the same anisotropy for charged and neutral pions, the anisotropy in photons is estimated and compared with the measured anisotropy. The effect of neutral pion decay on the correlation between the ﬁrst order and the second order event plane is also discussed. Data from PMD can also be used to estimate the reaction plane for studying any anisotropy in particle emission characteristics in the ALICE experiment at the large hadron collider (LHC). In particular, we show that using the event plane from the PMD, it will be possible to measure the anisotropy in $J/\psi$ absorption (if any) in the ALICE experiment.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>First observations of elliptic ﬂow in Au–Au collisions at RHIC have been interpreted as evidence that the colliding system reaches thermal equilibrium. We discuss some of the arguments leading to this conclusion and show that a more accurate analysis is needed, which the standard ﬂow analysis may not provide. We then present a new method of ﬂow analysis, based on a systematic study of multiparticle azimuthal correlations. This method allows one to test quantitatively the collective behaviour of the interacting system. It has recently been applied by the STAR Collaboration at RHIC.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This review of low-$p_{T}$ proton–proton physics at low luminosity at the large hadron collider (LHC) should cover all LHC experiments, but in practice, is mainly related to ALICE, for reasons which will be explained. However, the relevance to other LHC experiments is clear, as low-$p_{T}$ phenomena represent an important component of the background to their high-$p_{T}$ phenomena which needs to be calibrated. The ALICE collaboration will study proton–proton collisions as part of their heavy-ion programme, where most signals are relative to the proton–proton system. In addition, the ALICE detector’s unique acceptance at low $p_{T}$ as well as its unique particle identiﬁcation capability will make it possible to carry out a program of genuine proton–proton physics complementary to those of other LHC experiments.</p>

				<title>Physics perspectives of the ALICE experiment at the large hadron collider</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0851-0863</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The large hadron collider (LHC) under construction at CERN will deliver ion beams up to centre of mass energies of the order of 5.5 TeV per nucleon, in case of lead. If compared to the available facilities for the study of nucleus–nucleus collisions (SpS and RHIC), this represents a huge step forward in terms of both volume and energy density that can be attained in nuclear interactions. ALICE (a large ion collider experiment) is the only detector speciﬁcally designed for the physics of nuclear collisions at LHC, even though it can also study high cross-section processes occurring in proton–proton collisions. The main goal of the experiment is to observe and study the phase transition from hadronic matter to deconﬁned partonic matter (quark gluon plasma – QGP). ALICE is conceived as a general-purpose detector and will address most of the phenomena related to the QGP formation at LHC energies: for this purpose, a large fraction of the hadrons, leptons and photons produced in each interaction will be measured and identiﬁed.</p>

					<p>We review experimental results on baryon production at mid-rapidity in nucleus–nucleus collisions at RHIC. Outstanding physics issues include the mechanism for baryon–anti-baryon production from thermally equilibrated partons, the dynamics of baryon number transport and the evolution dynamics of baryons during hadronic expansion before the ﬁnal freeze-out. We highlight recent measurements on the production of protons, lambdas and their anti-particles in terms of these physics issues. We propose a physical mechanism of topological baryon formation through gluon junction hadronization and future measurements, which can test this hypothesis experimentally.</p>

				<title>A ﬁrst look at Au + Au collisions at RHIC energies using the PHOBOS detector</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0921-0931</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The PHOBOS detector has been used to study Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}=56$, $130$, and 200 GeV. Several global observables have been measured and the results are compared with theoretical models. These observables include the charged-particle multiplicity measured as a function of beam energy, pseudo-rapidity, and centrality of the collision. A unique feature of the PHOBOS detector is its almost complete angular coverage such that these quantities can be studied over a pseudo-rapidity interval of $|\eta|\leq 5.4$. This allows for an almost complete integration of the total charged particle yield, which is found to be about $N^{\text{tot}}_{\text{ch}}=4500\pm 470$ at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}=130$ GeV and $N^{\text{tot}}_{\text{ch}}=5300\pm 530$ at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}$ GeV.</p>
					<p>The ratio of anti-particles to particles emitted in the mid-rapidity region has also been measured using the PHOBOS magnetic spectrometer. Of particular interest is the ratio of anti-protons to protons in the mid-rapidity region, which was found to be $\overline{p}/p= 0.6\pm 0.04$(stat) $\pm 0.06$(syst) at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}=130$ GeV. This high value suggests that an almost baryon-free region has been produced in the collisions.</p>

New data from RHIC and direct photon production results from CERN have been shown that point out the ﬁeld’s future direction: analysis of partonic matter at $T &gt; 200$ MeV.

					<p>The particle density at mid-rapidity is an essential global variable for the characterization of nuclear collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. It provides information about the initial conditions and energy density reached in these collisions. The pseudorapidity densities of charged particles at mid-rapidity in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}=130$ and 200 GeV at RHIC (relativistic heavy ion collider) have been measured with the PHENIX detector. The measurements were performed using sets of wire-chambers with pad readout in the two central PHENIX tracking arms. Each arm covers one quarter of the azimuth in the pseudorapidity interval $|\eta| &lt; 0.35$. Data is presented and compared with results from proton–proton collisions and nucleus–nucleus collisions at lower energies. Extrapolations to LHC energies are discussed.</p>

					<p>We investigate the role of Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) of anti-kaons on the equation of state (EoS) and other properties of compact stars. In the framework of relativistic mean ﬁeld model we determine the EoS for $\beta$-stable hyperon matter and compare it to the situation when anti-kaons condense in the system. We observe that anti-kaon condensates soften the EoS, thereby lowering the maximum mass of the stars. We also demonstrate that the presence of antikaon condensates in the high density core of compact stars may lead to a new mass sequence beyond white dwarf and neutron stars. The limiting mass of the new sequence stars is nearly equal to that of neutron star branch though they have distinctly different radii and compositions. They are called neutron star twins.</p>

					<p>A novel gas-based detector using large arrays of honeycomb cells has been developed and tested for use as a pre-shower photon multiplicity detector (PMD) for STAR and ALICE experiments. The appropriate cell design was arrived at using GARFIELD simulations. Prototype chambers with cell dimensions corresponding to STAR and ALICE were fabricated and tested at CERN PS and SPS. The charged particle detection efﬁciency and the pre-shower characteristics have been studied using pion and electron beams.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Different from the early universe, heavy-ion collisions at very high energies do not reach statistical equilibrium, although thermal models explain many of their features. To account for nonequilibrium strong-coupling effects, a Fokker–Planck equation with time-dependent diffusion coefﬁcient is proposed. A schematic model for rapidity distributions of participant baryons is set up and solved analytically. The evolution from SIS via AGS and SPS to RHIC energies is discussed. Strong-coupling diffusion produces double-peaked spectra in central collisions at the higher SPS momentum of 158 A$\cdot$GeV/c and beyond.</p>

				<page>1039-1044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A review of meson emission in heavy-ion collisions at incident energies from SIS up to collider energies is presented. A statistical model assuming chemical equilibrium and local strangeness conservation (i.e. strangeness conservation per collision) explains most of the observed features, e.g. the different centrality dependences of pions and kaons. Furthermore, the independence of the $K^{+}$ to $K^{-}$ ratio on the number of participating nucleons observed between SIS and relativistic heavy-ion collider (RHIC) is consistent with this model.</p>
					<p>The observed maximum in the $K^{+}/\pi^{+}$ excitation function is also seen in the ratio of strange to non-strange particle production. The appearance of this maximum around 30 A$\cdot$GeV is due to the energy dependence of the chemical freeze-out parameters $T$ and $\mu_{B}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present the measurements of charged particle pseudorapidity distributions ${\rm d}N_{\text{ch}}/{\rm d}\eta$ performed by the NA50 experiment in Pb–Pb collisions at the CERN SPS. Measurements were done at incident energies of 40 GeV ($\sqrt{s}=8.77$ GeV) and 158 GeV ($\sqrt{s}=17.3$ GeV) per nucleon over a broad impact parameter range. The multiplicity distributions are studied as a function of centrality using the number of participating nucleons $(N_{\text{part}})$, or the number of binary nucleon–nucleon collisions $(N_{\text{coll}})$. Their values at midrapidity exhibit a linear scaling with $N_{\text{part}}$ at both energies. Particle yield increases approximately by a factor of $2$ between $\sqrt{s}=8.77$ GeV and $\sqrt{s}=17.3$ GeV.</p>

In the mass region $m &gt; 0.2$ GeV/c$^{2}$, an enhancement of $2.7\pm 0.4$(stat.)$\pm 0.5$(syst.) compared to the expectation from known hadronic decay sources was observed. In the 40 A$\cdot$GeV data taken in 1999, an enhancement is again found; a preliminary analysis gives an even larger value of $5.0\pm 1.3$(stat.). The results are compared to theoretical model calculations based on $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ annihilation with a modiﬁed $\rho$-propagator; they may be related to chiral symmetry restoration.</p>

					<p>The photon yield from a baryon-rich quark gluon plasma (QGP) at SPS energy has been estimated. In the QGP phase, rate of photon production is evaluated up to two-loop level. In the hadron phase, dominant contribution from $\pi$, $\rho$, $\omega$ mesons has been considered. The evolution of the plasma has been studied with appropriate equation of state in both QGP and hadron phase for a baryon-rich system.

				<abstract>
					<p>We evaluate the suppression of $J/\psi$ production in an equilibrating quark gluon plasma for two competing mechanisms: Debye screening of colour interaction and dissociation due to energetic gluons. Results are obtained for S + S and Au + Au collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. At RHIC energies the gluonic dissociation of the charmonium is found to be equally important for both the systems while the screening of the interaction plays a signiﬁcant role only for the larger systems. At LHC energies the Debye mechanism is found to dominate both the systems. While considering the suppression of directly produced $\Upsilon$ at LHC energies, we ﬁnd that only the gluonic dissociation mechanism comes into play for the initial conditions taken from the self screened parton cascade model in these studies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>No conventional picture of nucleus–nucleus collisions has yet been able to explain the abundance of $\Omega$ and $\overline{\Omega}$ in central collisions between Pb nuclei at 158 A GeV at the CERN SPS. We argue that such a deviation from predictions of statistical thermal models and numerical simulations is the evidence that they are produced as topological defects in the form of skyrmions arising from the formation of disoriented chiral condensates. The estimated domain size falls in the right range to be consistent with the so far non-observation of disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) from the distribution of neutral pions.</p>

					<p>We analyze elliptic ﬂow from SIS to RHIC energies systematically in a realistic dynamical cascade model. We compare our results with the recent data from STAR and PHOBOS collaborations on elliptic ﬂow of charged particles at midrapidity in Au + Au collisions at RHIC. In the analysis of elliptic ﬂow at RHIC energy, we ﬁnd a good ﬁtting with data at 1.5 times a scaling factor to our model, which characterizes that the model is required to have extra pressure generated from the subsequent parton scattering after the initial minijet production. In energy dependence of elliptic ﬂow, we notice re-hardening nature at RHIC energies. Both these two observations would probably imply the possible formation of quark–gluon plasma.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A year ago, we presented a new approach to treat hadronic interactions or the initial stage of nuclear collisions [1,2]. It is an effective theory based on the Gribov–Regge formalism, where the internal structure of the Pomerons at high energies is governed by perturbative parton evolution, therefore the name parton-based Gribov–Regge theory. The main improvement compared to models used so far is the appropriate treatment of the energy sharing between the different elementary interactions in case of multiple scattering. It is clear that the above formalism is not yet complete. At high energies (RHIC, LHC), the multiple elementary interactions (Pomerons) cannot be purely parallel, they interact. So we introduce multiple Pomeron vertices into the theory.</p>

					<p>We derive an optimal bound on the sum of entropic uncertainties of two or more observables when they are sequentially measured on the same ensemble of systems. This optimal bound is shown to be greater than or equal to the bounds derived in the literature on the sum of entropic uncertainties of two observables which are measured on distinct but identically prepared ensembles of systems. In the case of a two-dimensional Hilbert space, the optimum bound for successive measurements of two-spin components, is seen to be strictly greater than the optimal bound for the case when they are measured on distinct ensembles, except when the spin components are mutually parallel or perpendicular.</p>

					<p>In view of recent experimental progress on production and spectroscopy of neutron-rich isotopes of Dy with mass number $A = 166$ and $168$, we have made theoretical investigations on the structure of high spin states of $^{164-170}$Dy isotopes in the cranked Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov (CHFB) theory employing a pairing+quadrupole+hexadecapole model interaction. With the increase of neutron number the rotation alignment of the proton orbitals dominates the structure at high spins, which is clearly reﬂected in the spin dependence of the rotational g-factors. A particularly striking feature is the difference in the spin-dependent properties of $^{166}$Dy as compared to that of $^{164}$Dy.</p>

				<title>Ground state structure of some double-$\gamma$ hypernuclei by a three-body model using a simple coordinate space approach</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1179-1185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New experimental data on the binding energy $B_{\lambda\lambda}$ of $^{6}_{\lambda\lambda}$He, reported very recently, come up with the values $B_{\lambda\lambda} = 7.25\pm 0.14$ MeV and $\Delta B_{\gamma\gamma} = 1.01\pm 0.2$ MeV which are substantially lower than the old data $B_{\lambda\lambda} = 10.9\pm 0.8$ MeV and $\Delta B_{\lambda\lambda} = 4.7\pm 1.0$ MeV in use in literature since 1966. In view of the new data we decided to undertake a re-study of the $^{6}_{\lambda\lambda}$He hypernucleus using the same three-body model $(\alpha-\lambda-\lambda)$ with a simple coordinate space variational approach which was employed earlier with the old data on $^{6}_{\lambda\lambda}$He. After ﬁtting different $\lambda-\lambda$ potentials to the new data of $^{6}_{\lambda\lambda}$He we have applied our method to study some double-$\lambda$ hypernuclei in light, medium and heavy mass regions and have determined the structural quantities like $B_{\lambda\lambda}$, the r.m.s. values of core-$\lambda$ $(\langle r_{\text{core}-\lambda}\rangle)$ and $\lambda-\lambda$ $(\langle r_{\lambda-\lambda}\rangle)$ distances theoretically. The core-$\lambda$ interaction considered is of Woods–Saxon type. The strength and the range of the core-$\lambda$ potential have been adjusted to reproduce the $\lambda$-binding energy $(B_{\lambda})$. These are in good agreement with the relativistic mean ﬁeld (RMF) results. Our study shows that the $\lambda-\lambda$ bonding energy $\Delta B_{\lambda\lambda}$ decreases with increasing mass number from $^{10}_{\lambda\lambda}$Be to $^{210}_{\lambda\lambda}$Pb of a double-$\lambda$ hypernucleus.</p>

				<title>Coplanar $(e, 3e)$ differential cross-section of He atom</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1187-1201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present in this paper the results of our calculation of ﬁve-fold differential cross-section (FDCS) for $(e, 3e)$ process on He atom in low momentum transfer and high electron impact energy in shake-off mechanism. The formalism has been developed in Born approximation using plane waves, Byron and Joachain as well as Le Sech and correlated BBK-type wave functions respectively for incident and scattered, bound and ejected electrons. The angular distribution of FDCS of our calculation is presented in various modes of coplanar geometry and comparison is made with the available experimental data. We observe that the present calculation is able to reproduce the trend of the experimental data. However, it differs in magnitude from the experiment. The present theory does not predict four-peak structure in summed mutual angle mode for lower excess ejected electron energies. We also discuss the importance of momentum transfer, post-collision interaction (PCI) and ion participation in the $(e, 3e)$ process in constant $\theta_{12}$ mode.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Relative cross sections, differential in energy and angle, for electrons ejected from CH$_{4}$ and C$_{3}$H$_{8}$ molecules under 16.0 keV electron impact have been measured. Electrons were analyzed by a 45$^{\circ}$ parallel plate electrostatic analyzer at emission angles varying from $60^{\circ}$ to $135^{\circ}$ with energies from 50 eV to 1000 eV. The angular distributions of electrons exhibit structures which are found to arise from Coulomb and non-Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the double differential cross sections of electrons ejected from C$_{3}$H$_{8}$ molecule are found to be higher in magnitude than those from CH$_{4}$. This result supports the fact that the number of ejected electrons participating in collisions with C$_{3}$H$_{8}$ molecules is more than that in CH$_{4}$. Also, the angular distributions of C–K-shell Auger electrons emitted from the target molecules have been studied and shown to be isotropic within the experimental uncertainty.</p>

The contribution of the s-like electrons is calculated in the second-order perturbation theory for the potential while d- and f-like electron is taken into account by introducing repulsive short-range Born–Mayer term. The parameter of the potential is evaluated by zero pressure condition. An excellent agreement between theoretical investigations and experimental ﬁndings is achieved which conﬁrms the present formalism.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1247-1257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The temperature dependence of dc photoconductivity in the measuring range 303–417 K has been studied in CdTe thin ﬁlms having thickness $t &lt; 4000$ Å. The photoactivation energy decreases in dark which is explained on the basis of grain boundary (GB) effect. The current lost to recombination at GB space charge region causes a negative effect on the photosensitivity of the ﬁlms. A decrease in photosensitivity with increase in temperature is attributed to the reduction of photoexcitation process. It is observed that the minority carrier lifetime varies inversely with light intensity which supports the sublinear relationship of photoconductivity with the intensity of light and thereby conﬁrms the defect-controlled photoconductivity in CdTe thin ﬁlms.</p>

				<title>Study of solar features causing GMSs with $250\gamma &lt; H &lt; 400\gamma$</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0021-0031</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of solar features on geospheric conditions leading to geomagnetic storms (GMSs) with planetary index, $A_{p}\geq 20$ and the range of horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld $H$ such that $250\gamma &lt; H &lt; 400\gamma$ has been investigated using interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF), solar wind plasma (SWP) and solar geophysical data (SGD) during the period 1978–99. Statistically, it is observed that maximum number of GMSs have occurred during the maximum solar activity years of 21st and 22nd solar cycles. A peculiar result has been observed during the years 1982, 1994 when sunspot numbers (SSNs) decrease very rapidly while numbers of GMSs increase. No distinct association between yearly occurrence of disturbed days and SSNs is observed. Maximum number of disturbed days have occurred during spring and rainy seasons showing a seasonal variation of disturbed days. No signiﬁcant correlation between magnitude (intensity) of GMSs and importance of $H_{\alpha}$, X-ray solar ﬂares has been observed. Maximum number of GMSs is associated with solar ﬂares of lower importance, i.e., SF during the period 1978–93. $H_{\alpha}$, X-ray solar ﬂares occurred within lower helio-latitudes, i.e., (0–30)$^{\circ}$N to (0–30)$^{\circ}$S are associated with GMSs. No $H_{\alpha}$, X-ray solar ﬂares have occurred beyond 40$^{\circ}$N or 40$^{\circ}$S in association with GMSs. In helio-latitude range (10–40)$^{\circ}$N to (10–40)$^{\circ}$S, the 89.5% concentration of active prominences and disappearing ﬁlaments (APDFs) are associated with GMSs. Maximum number of GMSs are associated with solar ﬂares. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are related with eruptive prominences, solar ﬂares, type IV radio burst and they occur at low helio-latitude. It is observed that CMEs related GMS events are not always associated with high speed solar wind streams (HSSWSs). In many individual events, the travel time between the explosion on the Sun and maximum activity lies between 58 and 118 h causing GMSs at the Earth.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0033-0050</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the presence of an electric dipole coupling of $t\overline{t}$ to a photon, and an analogous ‘weak’ dipole coupling to the $Z$, CP violation in the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to t\overline{t}$ results in modiﬁed polarization of the top and the anti-top. This polarization can be analyzed by studying the angular distributions of decay charged leptons when the top or anti-top decays leptonically. Analytic expressions are presented for these distributions when either $t$ or $\overline{t}$ decays leptonically, including $\mathscr{O}(\alpha_{s})$ QCD corrections in the soft-gluon approximation. The angular distributions are insensitive to anomalous interactions in top decay. Two types of simple CP-violating polar-angle asymmetries and two azimuthal asymmetries, which do not need the full reconstruction of the $t$ or $\overline{t}$, are studied. Independent 90% CL limits that may be obtained on the real and imaginary parts of the electric and weak dipole couplings at a linear collider operating at $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV with integrated luminosity 500 fb$^{-1}$ and also at $\sqrt{s} = 1000$ GeV with integrated luminosity 1000 fb$^{-1}$ have been evaluated. The effect of longitudinal electron and/or positron beam polarizations has been included.</p>

				<title>Fusion, resonances and scattering in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0051-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The variation of fusion cross-section $(\sigma_{\text{fus}})$ with energy in the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C collision is linked to the underlying resonance phenomenon through the behavior of reaction cross-section $(\sigma_{r})$ of which $\sigma_{\text{fus}}$ is taken as a part. The calculation of $\sigma_{\text{fus}}$ is done through an energy-dependent imaginary potential in the optical model potential (OMP). Through dispersion relation, such an imaginary potential gives rise to energy-dependent real potential which is incorporated in the OMP. In our calculation, a form of potential for the nuclear part which has a soft repulsive in-built core is introduced based on similar works done earlier. The calculated results of $\sigma_{\text{fus}}$ are used to explain the oscillatory structure, astrophysical $S$-factor and the decreasing trend at higher energies of the experimental $\sigma_{\text{fus}}$ data in the case of $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C system with remarkable success. The potential used for fusion calculation is tested for ﬁtting elastic scattering data at some energies and is found good in forward angles. Further improvement of the ﬁtting of these data is obtained by incorporating a coupling potential in the surface region. About twenty resonances are observed in our calculation in the speciﬁc partial waves and some of them are found close to the experimentally identiﬁed resonances in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction. Thus, we provide an integrated and comprehensive analysis of fusion, resonance and scattering data in the best studied case of $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction within the framework of optical potential model.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0067-0083</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Resonant spin-ﬂavor precession (RSFP) scenario with twisting solar magnetic ﬁelds has been confronted with the solar neutrino data from various ongoing experiments. The anticorrelation apparent in the Homestake solar neutrino data has been taken seriously to constrain $(\Delta m^{2},\phi')$ parameter space and the twisting proﬁles of the magnetic ﬁeld in the convective zone of the Sun. The twisting proﬁles, thus derived, have been used to calculate the variation of the neutrino detection rates with the solar magnetic activity for the Homestake, Super-Kamiokande and the gallium experiments. It is found that the presence of twisting reduces the degree of anticorrelation in all the solar neutrino experiments. However, the anticorrelation in the Homestake experiment is expected to be more pronounced in this scenario. Moreover, the anticorrelation of the solar neutrino ﬂux emerging from the southern solar hemisphere is expected to be stronger than that for the neutrinos emerging from the northern solar hemispheres.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The dynamics of a self-gravitating unmagnetized, inhomogeneous, streaming dusty plasma is studied in the present work. The presence of the shear ﬂow causes the coupling between gravitational and electrostatic forces. In the absence of self-gravity, the ﬂuctuations in the plasma may grow at the expense of the density inhomogeneity and for certain wavelengths, such an unstable mode may dominate the usual streaming instability.

				<title>Dynamics of hydrogen in hydrogenated amorphous silicon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0121-0129</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of hydrogen diffusion in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) is studied semiclassically. It is found that the local hydrogen concentration ﬂuctuations-induced extra potential wells, if intense enough, lead to the localized electronic states in a-Si:H. These localized states are metastable. The trapping of electrons and holes in these states leads to the electrical degradation of the material. These states also act as recombination centers for photo-generated carriers (electrons and holes) which in turn may excite a hydrogen atom from a nearby Si–H bond and breaks the weak (strained) Si–Si bond thereby apparently enhancing the hydrogen diffusion and increasing the light-induced dangling bonds.</p>

					<p>Connecting two columnar phase forming discotic mesogens via a short rigid spacer leads to the formation of a $\pi$-conjugated discotic dimer showing discotic nematic $(N_{D})$ phase. Attaching branched-alkyl chains directly to the core in hexaalkynylbenzene resulted in the stabilisation of $N_{D}$ phase at ambient temperature. Pentalkynylbenzene derivatives possessing a combination of normal-and branched-alkoxy chains display a very broad $N_{D}$ phase which is stable well below and above the room temperature.</p>

				<title>Contribution of proton NMR relaxation to the investigation of molecular dynamics in columnar mesophases of discotic and polycatenar molecules</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0205-0218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present in this work a review concerning wide frequency range $T_{1}$ proton NMR relaxation studies performed in compounds exhibiting columnar mesophases, namely the Col$_{\text{ho}}$ mesophase in the case of a liquid crystal of discotic molecules and the $\phi_{h}$ mesophase in the case of a liquid crystal of biforked molecules. These NMR relaxation studies were performed combining conventional and fast ﬁeld cycling NMR techniques in a frequency range between 100 Hz and 300 MHz. The possibility of probing such a large frequency range has provided a way to effectively distinguish the inﬂuence, on the $T_{1}$ relaxation proﬁles, of the different molecular movements observed in this type of mesophases. In addition, we present a comparison between the molecular dynamics in columnar $(\phi_{h})$ and lamellar (SmC) mesophases exhibited by the same biforked compound.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The biaxial nematic liquid crystalline phase was predicted several decades ago. Several vigorous attempts to ﬁnd it in various systems resulted in mis-identiﬁcations. The results of X-ray diffraction and optical texture studies of the phases exhibited by rigid bent-core molecules derived from 2,5-bis-($p$-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole reveal that the biaxial nematic phase is formed by three compounds of this type. X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the nematic phase of these compounds has the achiral symmetry D$_{\text{2h}}$, in which the overall long axes of the molecules are oriented parallel to each other to deﬁne the major axis of the biaxial phase. The apex of the bent-cores deﬁnes the minor axis of this phase along which the planes containing the bent-cores of neighboring molecules are oriented parallel to each other.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>3,5-Disubstituted 1,2,4-oxadiazoles are a new type of liquid crystalline (LC) compounds with asymmetrical ﬁve-membered heterocycle as a central unit. They have a bent shape and are very convenient model-compounds for studying the dependence of the LC properties on the molecular design. We have also synthesized and investigated ‘banana-shaped’ 1,2,4-oxadiazoles using the ester groups as the linkage units. The new compounds exhibit spontaneous polarization in the smectic phase, even if there is no chiral group in the molecules. Preliminary experimental data suggest the presence of spontaneous polarization in the nematic phase as well. In order to study the structural properties of the LC phases, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on powder samples have been carried out. Based on the XRD data, a model of the structural arrangement of the bent molecules in the smectic phase is provided, which accounts for the macroscopic spontaneous polarization as well as the ferroelectric switching behavior.</p>

				<title>Ordering in nematic liquid crystals from NMR cross-polarization studies</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0249-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The measurement of dipolar couplings between nuclei is a convenient way of obtatining directly liquid crystalline ordering through NMR since the coupling is dependent on the average orientation of the dipolar vector in the magnetic ﬁeld which also aligns the liquid crystal. However, measurement of the dipolar coupling between a pair of selected nuclei is beset with problems that require special solutions. In this article the use of cross polarization for measuring dipolar couplings in liquid crystals is illustrated. Transient oscillations observed during cross polarization provide the dipolar couplings between essentially isolated nearest neighbour spins which can be extracted for several sites simultaneously by employing two-dimensional NMR techniques. The use of the method for obtaining heteronuclear dipolar couplings and hence the order parameters of liquid crystals is presented. Several modiﬁcations to the basic experiment are considered and their utility illustrated. A method for obtaining proton–proton dipolar couplings, by utilizing cross polarization from the dipolar reservoir, is also presented.</p>

				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0263-0275</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results of optical studies on the instabilities in a substrate-free nematic 8CB ﬁlm, subject to an in-plane electric ﬁeld. The initial director ﬁeld involves a $-1/2$ strength disclination loop, separating the central pseudoisotropic zone from the splay-bend (SB) birefringent boundary. Three regimes of sample thickness are distinguishable on the basis of ﬁeld-induced instabilities. Thick ($\sim 75$ $\mu$m) ﬁlms display growth of SB zones (independently of disclination movement), wall-formation, and reversible transition between walls and disclinations. Moderately thick ﬁlms, a few $\mu$m in the central part, exhibit distinctive undulations at the border of advancing SB layers. Submicron thin ﬁlms, with smectic-like homeotropic central plateau, show spectacular isotropic vortex-pairs at either end of this plateau. Further, the end regions of the birefringent zone exhibit both electro-convective ﬂows and reorientational effects. The latter are associated with the formation of open and closed walls, and loop-wall emission. The ﬁnal high ﬁeld instability involves jet-like ﬂows at the two ends of the ﬁlm.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Viscoelastic properties of liquid crystals are very important for applications like display technology. However, there are not many direct techniques to study them. In this review, we describe our studies on the viscoelastic modes of some chiral liquid crystals using dynamic light scattering. We discuss viscoelastic modes corresponding to the C director ﬂuctuations in the chiral smectic C phase and the behaviour of the Goldstone-mode near the chiral smectic C–smectic A phase transition. In cholesteric liquid crystals, we consider the director ﬂuctuations in a wavevector range comparable to the inverse pitch of the cholesteric. Here, the study of the scattered light in the vicinity of the Bragg reﬂection using a novel geometry will be presented.</p>

				<title>Displaying gray shades in liquid crystal displays</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0313-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quality of image in a display depends on the contrast, colour, resolution and the number of gray shades. A large number of gray shades is necessary to display images without any contour lines. These contours are due to limited number of gray shades in the display causing abrupt changes in grayness of the image, while the original image has a gradual change in brightness. Amplitude modulation has the capability to display a large number of gray shades with minimum number of time intervals [1,2]. This paper will cover the underlying principle of amplitude modulation, some variants and its extension to multi-line addressing. Other techniques for displaying gray shades in passive matrix displays are reviewed for the sake of comparison.</p>

					<p>Biomolecular electronics is rapidly evolving from physics, chemistry, biology, electronics and information technology. Organic materials such as proteins, pigments and conducting polymers have been considered as alternatives for carrying out the functions that are presently being performed by semiconductor silicon. Conducting polymers such as polypyrroles, polythiophenes and polyanilines have been projected for applications for a wide range of biomolecular electronic devices such as optical, electronic, drug-delivery, memory and biosensing devices. Our group has been actively working towards the application of conducting polymers to Schottky diodes, metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) devices and biosensors for the past 10 years. This paper is a review of some of the results obtained at our laboratory in the area of conducting polymer biomolecular electronics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Double stranded DNA chain is known to have non-trivial elasticity. We study the effect of this elasticity on the denaturation proﬁle of DNA oligomer by constraining one base pair at one end of the oligomer to remain in unstretched (or intact) state. The effect of this constraint on the denaturation proﬁle of the oligomer has been calculated using the Peyrard–Bishop Hamiltonian. The denaturation proﬁle is found to be very different from the free (i.e. without the constraint) oligomer. We have also examined how this constraint affects the denaturation proﬁle of the oligomer having a segment of defect sites located at different parts of the chain.</p>

					<p>We study the elastic responses of double- (ds) and single-stranded (ss) DNA at external force ﬁelds. A double-strand-polymer elastic model is constructed and solved by path integral methods and Monte Carlo simulations to understand the entropic elasticity, cooperative extensibility, and supercoiling property of dsDNA. The good agreement with experiments indicates that shortranged base-pair stacking interaction is crucial for the stability and the high deformability of dsDNA. Hairpin-coil transition in ssDNA is studied with generating function method. A threshold force is needed to pull the ssDNA hairpin patterns, stabilized by base pairing and base-pair stacking, into random coils. This phase transition is predicted to be of ﬁrst order for stacking potential higher than some critical level, in accordance with experimental observations.</p>

				<title>Hydrophobicity-induced drying transition in alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer–water interface</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0361-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the course of our investigation of the electron transfer properties of some redox species through highly hydrophobic long chain alkanethiol molecules on gold in aqueous and non-aqueous solvents, we obtained some intriguing results such as unusually low interfacial capacitance, very high values of impedance and ﬁlm resistance, all of which pointed to the possible existence of a nanometer size interfacial gap between the hydrophobic monolayer and aqueous electrolyte. We explain this phenomenon by a model for the alkanethiol monolayer–aqueous electrolyte interface, in which the extremely hydrophobic alkanethiol ﬁlm repels water molecules adjacent to it and in the process creates a shield between the monolayer ﬁlm and water. This effectively increases the overall thickness of the dielectric layer that is manifested as an abnormally low value of interfacial capacitance. This behaviour is very much akin to the ‘drying transition’ proposed by Lum, Chandler and Weeks in their theory of length scale dependent hydrophobicity. For small hydrophobic units consisting of apolar solutes, the water molecules can reorganize around them without sacriﬁcing their hydrogen bonds. Since for an extended hydrophobic unit, the existence of hydrogen bonded water structure close to it is geometrically unfavourable, there is a net depletion of water molecules in the vicinity leading to the possible creation of a hydrophobic interfacial gap.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence confocal polarizing microscopy: Three-dimensional imaging of the director</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0373-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Much of the modern understanding of orientational order in liquid crystals (LCs) is based on polarizing microscopy (PM). A PM image bears only two-dimensional (2D) information, integrating the 3D pattern of optical birefringence over the path of light. Recently, we proposed a technique to image 3D director patterns by ﬂuorescence confocal polarizing microscopy (FCPM). The technique employs the property of LC to orient the ﬂuorescent dye molecules of anisometric shape, added in small quantities to the LC. In LC, smooth director deformations do not alter mass density of the material. Thus the density of dye is also uniform across the sample, except, perhaps, near the surfaces or at the cores of topological defects. In polarized light, the measured ﬂuorescence signal is determined by the spatial orientation of the molecules rather than by dye concentration (as in regular biological samples stained with tissue-speciﬁc dyes). The contrast is enhanced when both excitation and detection of ﬂuorescence light are performed in polarized light. This short review describes the essence of FCPM technique and illustrates some of its applications, including imaging of Frederiks electric-ﬁeld induced effect in a nematic LC and defects such as dislocations in cholesteric LCs.</p>

				<title>Bidimensional distortion in ferroelectric liquid crystals with strong anchoring in bookshelf geometry</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0385-0393</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the last decade, it has been experimentally found that in certain conditions a periodic domain pattern arises in ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC) in bookshelf geometry. Such a periodic texture appears after switching-off an external electric ﬁeld, even in strong anchoring conditions. It has a static character and is bidimensional, being dependent on directions normal to both the smectic planes and the cell plates. Here a new model explaining this phenomenon is proposed, valid in the case of FLC with strong anchoring. The model is based on the coupling between the spontaneous polarization ﬁeld in the ﬁrst semi-period of its modulation along the cell plates and the same ﬁeld in the second semi-period. This coupling competes with the FLC medium elasticity and is trapped by the anchoring. According to our model, in the ferroelectric state the biperiodic texture is favored by increasing the values of spontaneous polarization. The critical value of the spontaneous polarization for which the undeformed state becomes unstable is found. It is shown to be proportional to the square root of the ratio between the FLC elastic constant and the cell thickness. Moreover, it is inversely proportional to the sinus of the pre-tilt angle with respect to the cell walls.</p>

				<title>On some liquid crystalline phases exhibited by compounds made of bent-core molecules and their mixtures with rod-like molecules</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0405-0415</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In most homologous series of compounds made of bent-core (BC) molecules, the B$_{2}$, B$_{1}$ and B$_{6}$ phases occur as the chain length decreases. We have studied binary mixtures of the compound 1,3-phenylene bis[4-(3-methylbenzoyloxy)]$4'$-$n$-dodecylbiphenyl $4'$-carboxylate (BC12) which exhibits the B$_{2}$ phase with the compound 4-biphenylyl $4''$-$n$-undecyloxybenzoate (BO11) made of rod-like (R) molecules. We ﬁnd the above sequence of occurrence of the B phases with increasing concentration of BO11. In this paper we describe the physical origin for the formation of these phases in both pure compounds and in the mixtures. We have also found the occurrence of the biaxial smectic A phase when the BO11 concentration is increased to 87–95.5 mol%. We also report on another binary system composed of BC12 and 4-$n$-octyloxy $4'$- cyanobiphenyl (8OCB) made of R molecules. This system exhibits the biaxial smectic A phase down to 30$^{\circ}$C. Using polarized infrared spectroscopy we ﬁnd that the mutual orientation of the R and BC molecules in the SmA$_{\text{db}}$ liquid crystal is such that the arrow axes of the BC molecules are along the layer normal of the partial bilayer smectic structure formed by the rods. We also describe unusual growth patterns obtained when the nematic phase transforms to the SmA$_{\text{db}}$ phase in a mixture with 24 mol% of BC12.</p>

				<title>Inﬂuence of hydrogen bonding on the generation and stabilization of liquid crystalline polyesters, poly(esteramide)s and polyacrylates</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0417-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Induction and stabilization of liquid crystallinity through hydrogen bonding (HB) are now well-established. Interesting observations made on the inﬂuence of HB on LC behaviour of amido diol-based poly(esteramide)s, poly(esteramide)s containing nitro groups and azobenzene mesogen-based polyacrylates will be discussed. The use of amido diol as an important precursor for the synthesis of novel PEAs containing inbuilt di-amide linkage enabled generation of extensive hydrogen bondings between the amide–amide and amide–ester groups which stabilized the mesophase structures of the PEAs. The contributions of hydrogen bonding to the generation and stabilization of mesophase structures were plainly evident from the observation of liquid crystallinity even in PEAs prepared from fully aliphatic amido diols. Replacement of terephthaloyl units by isophthaloyl moiety totally vanquished liquid crystalline phases while biphenylene and naphthalene units did only reduce the transition temperatures as expected. The occurrence of the smectic phases in some of the polymers indicated possibly self-assembly through the formation of hetero intermolecular hydrogen bonded networks. A smectic polymorphism and in addition, a smectic-to-nematic transition, were observed in the monomers and polymers based on 1,4-phenylene[bis-(3-nitroanthranilidic acid)] containing nitro groups. A smectic polymorphism was also observed as a combined effect of hydrogen bonded carboxyl groups and laterally substituted alkyl side chains in the case of azobenzene mesogen containing side chain polyacrylates. It was further shown that the presence of the mesophase enhances the non-linear optical (NLO) response of these polymers.</p>

				<title>Segmented conjugated polymers</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0425-0434</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Segmented conjugated polymers, wherein the conjugation is randomly truncated by varying lengths of non-conjugated segments, form an interesting class of polymers as they not only represent systems of varying stiffness, but also ones where the backbone can be construed as being made up of chromophores of varying excitation energies. The latter feature, especially when the chromophores are ﬂuorescent, like in MEHPPV, makes these systems particularly interesting from the photophysics point of view. Segmented MEHPPV-$x$ samples, where x represents the mole fraction of conjugated segments, were prepared by a novel approach that utilizes a suitable precursor wherein selective elimination of one of the two eliminatable groups is affected; the uneliminated units serve as conjugation truncations. Control of the composition x of the precursor therefore permits one to prepare segmented MEHPPV-$x$ samples with varying levels of conjugation (elimination). Using ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, we have seen that even in single isolated polymer chains, energy migration from the shorter (higher energy) chromophores to longer (lower energy) ones occurs – the extent of which depends on the level of conjugation. Further, by varying the solvent composition, it is seen that the extent of energy transfer and the formation of poorly emissive inter-chromophore excitons are greatly enhanced with increasing amounts of non-solvent. A typical S-shaped curve represents the variation of emission yields as a function of composition suggestive of a cooperative collapse of the polymer coil, reminiscent of conformational transitions seen in biological macromolecules.</p>

				<title>Photo-orientation at liquid crystal–polymer interfaces</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0435-0445</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is suggested that liquid crystal–polymer interfaces are coupled systems, in which the components mutually inﬂuence the orientational state of each other. The photo-orientation process at liquid crystal–polymer interfaces provides a striking example of such a coupling. Experiments show that the anisotropic structure generated by polarised light at a polymer surface is strongly affected by the phase of the liquid crystal covering the polymer. Photo-orientation is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient when the liquid crystal is in the isotropic phase than when it exhibits orientational order. The observations are interpreted by assuming that in the smectic and nematic phases the liquid crystal stabilises to a large extent polymer chain-segments aligned parallel to the director, while it blocks the photo-induced formation of chain-segments in the perpendicular direction. Other situations, in which the coupling between the liquid crystal and the polymer can be important, are also discussed brieﬂy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Structures of complexes formed in aqueous solutions by some anionic polyelectrolytes (double and single stranded (ds and ss) DNA, poly(vinyl sulfonate) (PVS), and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS)) with a cationic surfactant system consisting of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoate (SHN) have been determined using small angle X-ray diffraction. All complexes are found to have a two-dimensional (2-D) hexagonal structure at low SHN concentrations. Analysis of the diffraction data shows that the ds DNA–CTAB complex has an intercalated structure, with each DNA strand surrounded by three cylindrical micelles. On increasing SHN concentration, DNA–CTAB–SHN complexes exhibit a hexagonal-to-lamellar transition, whereas PVS complexes show a hexagonal $\to$ centered rectangular $\to$ lamellar transition. PSS complexes show yet another sequence of structures. These results indicate the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the chemical nature of the polyelectrolyte on the structure of the complexes.</p>

				<title>From antiferroelectricity to ferroelectricity in smectic mesophases formed by bent-core molecules</title>
				<feature>Special Issue</feature>
				<page>0455-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This contribution gives an overview of ferroelectric switching liquid crystalline phases formed by bent-core molecules. First a description of some general principles behind the mesophase formation within bent-core systems will be given, followed by a short review of the mesophase structures formed by such molecules. Then, different classes of ferroelectric switching bent-core mesogens will be described. This type of switching behaviour has been reported for several subtypes of polar smectic phases (B2, B5, B7 and SmC$_{\text{G}}$) and recently for columnar mesophases. In this discussion particular attention will be made to polyphilic bent-core molecules, composed of three incompatible units, a bent aromatic core, alkyl chains and an oligosiloxane unit. The importance of the decoupling of the layers into microsegregated sublayers for the ferroelectric organisation is discussed. Many of the ferroelectric switching mesophases show dark textures with distinct regions of opposite chirality in their ground states. It is discussed that this might be due to a helical superstructure formed as a result of an escape from macroscopic polar order. Hence, the materials themselves are not ferroelectric in the ground state, but upon alignment within an electric ﬁeld in the measuring cells the ferroelectric states are stabilised by surface interactions, leading to a ferroelectric switching system. The designing principle was extended to mesogenic dimers with bent-core structural units. For these compounds, depending on the number of dimethylsiloxane units in the spacer either ferroelectric or antiferroelectric switching was observed, whereby the effect of parity is reversed to that observed for conventional calamitic dimesogens. Finally, a carbosilane-based ﬁrst generation dendrimer is reported. It shows a ferroelectric switching phase, for which a non-correlated organisation of tilted polar smectic layers is proposed (SmCP$_{\text{R}}$).</p>

					<p>The effect of inelastic excitation of exotic light projectiles (proton- as well as neutron-rich) $^{17}$F and $^{11}$Be on fusion with heavy target has been studied at near-barrier energies. The calculations have been performed in the coupled channels approach where, in addition to the normal coupling of the ground state of the projectile to the continuum, inelastic excitation of the projectile to the bound excited state and its coupling to the continuum have also been taken into consideration. The inclusion of these additional couplings has been found to have signiﬁcant effect on the fusion excitation function of neutron-rich $^{11}$Be on $^{208}$Pb whereas the effect has been observed to be nominal for the case of proton-rich $^{17}$F on the same target. The pronounced effect of the channel coupling on the fusion process in the case of $^{11}$Be is attributed to its well-developed halo structure.</p>

					<p>The real and imaginary parts, $f'(E)$ and $f''(E)$ of the dispersion corrections to the forward Rayleigh scattering amplitude (also called anomalous scattering factors) for the elements La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Ho and Er, have been determined by a numerical evaluation of the dispersion integral that relates them through the optical theorem to the photoeffect cross-sections. The photoeffect cross-sections are derived from the total attenuation cross-section data set experimentally determined using high resolution high purity germanium detector in a narrow beam good geometry set-up for these elements in the photon energy range 5 to 1332 keV and reported earlier by the authors. Below 5 keV, Scoﬁeld’s photoeffect cross-sections compiled in XCOM program have been interpolated and used. Simple formulae for $f''$ in terms of atomic number and energy have also been obtained. The data cover the energy region from 6 to 85 keV and atomic number $Z$ from 57–68. The results obtained are found to agree fairly well with the other available data.</p>

This is in contrast with the results for linear structures, where the wave proﬁles can be conjugated for arbitrary values of the PCM reﬂectivity.

				<title>Field theoretic calculation of energy cascade rates in non-helical magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0577-0594</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Energy cascade rates and Kolmogorov’s constant for non-helical steady magnetohydrodynamic turbulence have been calculated by solving the ﬂux equations to the ﬁrst order in perturbation. For zero cross helicity and space dimension $d = 3$, magnetic energy cascades from  large length-scales to small length-scales (forward cascade). In addition, there are energy ﬂuxes from large-scale magnetic ﬁeld to small-scale velocity ﬁeld, large-scale velocity ﬁeld to small-scale magnetic ﬁeld, and large-scale velocity ﬁeld to large-scale magnetic ﬁeld. Kolmogorov’s constant for magnetohydrodynamics is approximately equal to that for ﬂuid turbulence $(\approx 1.6)$ for Alfvén ratio $0.5\leq r_{A}\leq \infty$. For higher space-dimensions, the energy ﬂuxes are qualitatively similar, and Kolmogorov’s constant varies as $d^{1/3}$. For the normalized cross helicity $\sigma_{c}\to 1$, the cascade rates are proportional to $(1-\sigma_{c})/(1+\sigma_{c})$, and the Kolmogorov’s constants vary signiﬁcantly with $\sigma_{c}$.</p>

					<p>The oscillatory wake potential for a slowly moving or static test dust particulate in a ﬁnite temperature, collisionless and unmagnetized dusty plasma with a continuous ﬂow of ions and dust particles has been studied. The collective resonant interaction of the moving test particle with the low-frequency and low-phase-velocity dust-acoustic mode is the origin of the periodic attractive force between the like polarity particulates along and perpendicular to the streaming ions and dust grains resulting into dust-Coulomb crystal formation. This wake potential can explain the three-dimensional dust-Coulomb crystal formation in the laboratory conditions.</p>

					<p>We revisit the Anderson–Hasegawa double-exchange model and critically examine its exact solution when the core spins are treated quantum mechanically. We show that the quantum effects, in the presence of an additional superexchange interaction between the core spins, yield a term, the signiﬁcance of which has been hitherto ignored. The importance of this term is further assessed by numerically exact computation for a four-spin system.</p>

					<p>Two-band Ginzburg–Landau (TB G–L) equations for a bulk MgB$_{2}$ were solved analytically to determine the temperature dependence of surface critical magnetic ﬁeld $H_{\text{c3}}(T)$.

We use an elimination procedure for the decoupling of G–L equations of two-band superconductivity, which eases the calculations.

				<abstract>
					<p>DC magnetization measurements are reported in the temperature range 20–300 K on a poly-disperse nano-particle sample of the spinel ferrite Fe$_{2.9}$Zn$_{0.1}$O$_{4}$ with a log-normal size distribution of median diameter 43.6 Å and standard deviation 0.58. Outside a core of ordered spins, moments in surface layer are disordered. Results also show some similarities with conventional spin glasses. Blocking temperature exhibits a near linear variation with two-third power of the applied magnetic ﬁeld and magnetization $M$ evolves nearly linearly with logarithm of time $t$. Magnetic anisotropy has been estimated by analysing the $M-\log t$ curve. Anisotropy values show a large increase over that of bulk particle samples. Major contribution to this enhancement comes from the disordered surface spins.</p>

					<p>A surface plasma wave (SPW) over bismuth–vacuum interface has a signature of mass anisotropy of free electrons. For SPW propagation along the trigonal axis there is no birefringence. The frequency cutoff of SPW $\omega_{\text{cutoff}}=\omega_{p}/\sqrt{2(\epsilon_{L}+\epsilon)}$ lies in the far infrared region and can be accessed using free electron laser. The damping rate of waves at low temperatures is low. The surface plasma wave may be excited by an electron beam of current $\sim 100$ mA propagating parallel to the interface in its close proximity.</p>

					<p>We examine a number of recent proofs of the spin–statistics theorem. All, of course, get the target result of Bose–Einstein statistics for identical integral spin particles and Fermi–Dirac statistics for identical half-integral spin particles. It is pointed out that these proofs, distinguished by their purported simple and intuitive kinematic character, require assumptions that are outside the realm of standard quantum mechanics. We construct a counterexample to these non-dynamical kinematic ‘proofs’ to emphasize the necessity of a dynamical proof as distinct from a kinematic proof. Sudarshan’s simple non-relativistic dynamical proof is brieﬂy described. Finally, we make clear the price paid for any kinematic ‘proof’.</p>

					<p>We report on the study of the mass–radius ($M$–$R$) relation and the radial oscillations of magnetized proto strange stars. For the quark matter we have employed the very recent modiﬁcation, the temperature- and density-dependent quark mass model of the well-known density-dependent quark mass model. We ﬁnd that the effect of magnetic ﬁeld, both on the maximum mass and radial frequencies, is rather small. Also a proto strange star, whether magnetized or otherwise, is more likely to evolve into a strange star rather than transform into a black hole.</p>

					<p>The spallation yield of neutrons and other mass fragments produced in 800 MeV proton induced reaction on $^{208}$Pb have been calculated in the framework of quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model. The energy spectra and angular distribution have been calculated. Also, multiplicity distributions of the emitted neutrons and kinetic energy carried away by them have been estimated and compared with the available experimental data. The agreement is satisfactory. A major contribution to the neutron emission comes from statistical decay of the fragments. For mass and charge distributions of spallation productsthe QMD process gives rise to target-like and projectile-like fragments only.</p>

					<p>A somewhat more general analysis for solving spatial propagation characteristics of intense Gaussian beam is presented and applied to the laser beam propagation in step-index proﬁle as well as parabolic proﬁle dielectric ﬁbers with Kerr non-linearity. Considering self-action due to saturating and non-saturating non-linearity in the refractive index, a general theory has been developed without any kind of power series expansion for the dielectric constant as is usually done in other theories that make use of paraxial approximation. Result of the steady state self-focusing analysis indicates that the Kerr non-linearity acts as a perturbation on the radial inhomogeneity due to ﬁber geometry. Analysis indicates that the paraxial rays and peripheral rays focus at different points, indicating aberration effect. Calculated critical power matches with the experimentally reported result.</p>

				<page>0707-0724</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Renormalized viscosity, renormalized resistivity, and various energy ﬂuxes are calculated for helical magnetohydrodynamics using perturbative ﬁeld theory. The calculation is of ﬁrst-order in perturbation. Kinetic and magnetic helicities do not affect the renormalized parameters, but they induce an inverse cascade of magnetic energy. The sources for the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld have been shown to be (1) energy ﬂux from large-scale velocity ﬁeld to large-scale magnetic ﬁeld arising due to non-helical interactions and (2) inverse energy ﬂux of magnetic energy caused by helical interactions. Based on our ﬂux results, a primitive model for galactic dynamo has been constructed. Our calculations yield dynamo time-scale for a typical galaxy to be of the order of $10^{8}$ years. Our ﬁeld-theoretic calculations also reveal that the ﬂux of magnetic helicity is backward, consistent with the earlier observations based on absolute equilibrium theory.</p>

Temperature dependence of the near-band-edge emission from these Cd-rich Zn$_{x}$Cd$_{1-x}$Se (for $x = 0.025$, 0.045) ﬁlms has been studied using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Relevant parameters that describe temperature variation of the energy and broadening of the fundamental band gap have been evaluated using various models including the two-oscillator model, the Bose–Einstein model and the Varshni model. While all these models sufﬁce to explain spectra at higher temperatures, the two-oscillator model not only explains low temperature spectra adequately but also provides additional information concerning phonon dispersion in these materials.</p>

Remarkably, this expansion is found to be identical to the WKB expansion obtained for the potential $x^{N}$ ($N$-even), if $2n/m$ is replaced by $N$. Taking the limit $m\to 2$ of the above expansion, we obtain an explicit asymptotic energy expansion of symmetric odd power potentials $|x|^{2j+1}$ ($j$-positive integer). We then show how to develop approximate semiclassical expansions for potentials $|x|^{\alpha}$ when $\alpha$ is any positive real number.</p>

				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0759-0772</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Simultaneous calculation of the dipole moment $\mu_{j}$ and the relaxation time $\tau_{j}$ of a certain number of non-spherical rigid aliphatic polar liquid molecules $(j)$ in non-polar solvents $(i)$ under 9.8 GHz electric ﬁeld is possible from real $\epsilon'_{ij}$ and imaginary $\epsilon''_{ij}$ parts of the complex relative permittivity $\epsilon^{*}_{ij}$. The low frequency and inﬁnite frequency permittivities $\epsilon_{0ij}$ and $\epsilon_{\infty ij}$ measured by Purohit et al [1,2] and Srivastava and Srivastava [3] at 25, 35 and $30^{\circ}$C respectively are used to obtain static $\mu_{s}$. The ratio of the individual slopes of imaginary $\sigma_{ij}$ and real $\sigma'_{ij}$ parts of high frequency (hf) complex conductivity $\sigma^{*}_{ij}$ with weight fractions $w_{j}$ at $w_{j}\to 0$ and the slopes of $\sigma''_{ij}-\sigma'_{ij}$ curves for different $w_{j}$s [4] are employed to obtain $\tau_{j}$s. The former method is better in comparison to the existing one as it eliminates polar–polar interaction. The hf $\mu_{j}$s in Coulomb metre (C m) when compared with static and reported $\mu$s indicate that $\mu_{s}$s favour the monomer formations which combine to form dimers in the hf electric ﬁeld. The comparison among $\mu$s shows that a part of the molecule is rotating under X-band electric ﬁeld [5]. The theoretical $\mu_{\text{theos}}$ from available bond angles and bond moments of the substituent polar groups attached to the parent molecules differ from the measured $\mu_{j}$s and $\mu$s to establish the possible existence of mesomeric, inductive and electromeric effects in polar liquid molecules.</p>

				<title>Response to the Comment: “On the computation of molecular auxiliary functions $A_{n}$ and $B_{n}$”</title>
				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0781-0783</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Comment ‘on the computation of auxiliary functions $A_{n}(p)$ and $B_{n}(pt)$’ (F E Harris, Pramana – J. Phys. {\bf 61}, C779 (2003)) is analysed in the arbitrary range of parameters $n$, $p$ and $pt$. It is shown that our downward recursion approach for $B_{n}(pt)$ in the range $(n/pt)&gt; 1$ is more efﬁcient than the well-known upward recursion method, and the upward recursion procedure for $A_{n}(p)$ does not have merit for smaller non-zero values of $p(p &lt; 0.01)$.</p>

					<p>The ratio of the electric and magnetic proton form factors, $G_{E_{p}}/G_{M_{p}}$, has been obtained in two Hall A experiments, from measurements of the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the recoil proton, $P_{\ell}$ and $P_{t}$, in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons, $\overrightarrow{e}p\to e\overrightarrow{p}$. Together these experiments cover the $Q^{2}$ range of 0.5 to 5.6 GeV$^{2}$. A new experiment is currently being prepared, to extend the $Q^{2}$ range to 9 GeV$^{2}$ in Hall C.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mapping the transition from strongly interacting, non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics, where nucleon–meson degrees of freedom are effective to perturbative QCD of quark and gluon degrees of freedom, is one of the most fundamental, challenging tasks in nuclear and particle physics. Exclusive processes such as proton–proton elastic scattering, meson photoproduction, and deuteron photodisintegration have been pursued extensively at many laboratories over the years in the search for such a transition, particularly at Jefferson Lab in recent years, taking the advantage of the high luminosity capability of the CEBAF facility. In this talk, I review recent results from Jefferson Lab on deuteron photodisintegration and photopion production processes and the future 12 GeV program.</p>

				<title>Review of Brookhaven nuclear transparency measurements in $(p,2p)$ reactions at large $Q^{2}$</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0847-0858</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this contribution we summarize the results of two experiments to measure the transparency of nuclei in the $(p, 2p)$ quasi-elastic scattering process near 90$^{\circ}$ in the $pp$ center-of-mass. The incident momenta went from 6 to 14.4 GeV/c, corresponding to $4.8 &lt; Q^{2} &lt; 12.7$ (GeV/c)$^{2}$. First, we describe the measurements with the newer experiment, E850, which has more complete kinematic deﬁnition of quasi-elastic events. E850 covers a larger range of incident momenta, and thus provides more information regarding the nature of the unexpected fall in the transparency above 9 GeV/c. Second, we review the techniques used in an earlier experiment, E834, and show that the two experiments are consistent for the carbon data. We use the transparencies measured in the ﬁve nuclei from Li to Pb to set limits on the rate of expansion for protons involved in quasi-elastic scattering at large momentum transfer.</p>

				<page>0859-0864</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In 2001–2002 the relativistic heavy-ion collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) was ﬁrst commissioned for polarized proton collisions. Polarized protons were injected into the RHIC, accelerated to 100 GeV, stored and the two beams were made to collide in four interaction regions. I will review the progress made by the RHIC spin program, followed by the physics goals for the next few years. After that I will present a brief overview of a proposal to build a high intensity polarized electron/positron beam facility at BNL which would enable deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments to be pursued at BNL by its collisions with the RHIC hadron beams.</p>

				<title>PHOBOS at RHIC: Some global observations</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0865-0876</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Particle production in Au+Au collisions has been measured in the PHOBOS experiment at RHIC for a range of collision energies for a large span of pseudorapidities, $|\eta| &lt; 5.4$. Three empirical observations have emerged from this data set which require theoretical examination. First, there is clear evidence of limiting fragmentation. Namely, particle production in central Au+Au collisions, when expressed as ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}\eta'$ ($\eta'\equiv \eta-y_{\text{beam}})$, becomes energy independent at high energy for a broad region of $\eta'$ around $\eta'=0$. This energy-independent region grows with energy, allowing only a limited region (if any) of longitudinal boost-invariance. Second, there is a striking similarity between particle production in $e^{+}e^{-}$ and Au + Au collisions (scaled by the number of participating nucleon pairs). Both the total number of produced particles and the longitudinal distribution of produced particles are approximately the same in $e^{+}e^{-}$ and in scaled Au + Au. This observation was not predicted and has not been explained. Finally, particle production has been found to scale approximately with the number of participating nucleon pairs for $\langle N_{\text{part}}\rangle &gt; 65$. This scaling occurs both for the total multiplicity and for high $p_{T}$ particles ($3 &lt; p_{T} &lt; 4.5$ GeV/c).</p>

					<p>Features of QCD can be seen qualitatively in certain condensed matter systems. Recently some of the analyses that originated in condensed matter physics have found applications in QCD. Using examples we discuss some of the connections between the two ﬁelds and show how progress can be made by exploiting this connection. Some of the challenges that remain in the two ﬁelds are quite similar. We argue that recent algorithmic developments call for optimism in both ﬁelds.</p>

				<page>0921-0930</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this talk I review studies of hadron properties in bosonized chiral quark models for the quark ﬂavor dynamics. Mesons are constructed from Bethe–Salpeter equations and baryons emerge as chiral solitons. Such models require regularization and I show that the two-fold Pauli–Villars regularization scheme not only fully regularizes the effective action but also leads the scaling laws for structure functions. For the nucleon structure functions the present approach serves to determine the regularization prescription for structure functions whose leading moments are not given by matrix elements of local operators. Some numerical results are presented for the spin structure functions.</p>

					<p>We review two methods discussed in the literature to determine the effective parameters of strongly interacting particles as they move through a heat bath. The ﬁrst one is the general method of chiral perturbation theory, which may be readily applied to this problem. The other is the method of thermal QCD sum rules. We show that, when the spectral sides of the sum rules are calculated correctly, they do not lead to any new results, but reproduce those of the vacuum sum rules.</p>

				<title>Anomalies, symmetries and strangeness content of the proton</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The matrix elements of the operators of strange quark ﬁelds $s\overline{\Gamma}s$ where $\Gamma$ is 1 or $\gamma_{\mu}\gamma^{5}$ between a proton state is calculated. The sigma term is found to be $\approx 41$ MeV and the $SU(3)$ singlet axial matrix element is found to be $\approx 0.22$, both in agreement with experiment. The sigma term is found using the trace anomaly, while the determination of the axial vector current matrix element is from QCD sum rules. These correspond to $\langle p|2\overline{ss}|\rangle / \langle p|\overline{u}u+\overline{d}d|p\rangle \approx 0.12$ and for the axial current $\Delta_{S}\approx -0.12$, respectively. The role of the anomalies in maintaining ﬂavor symmetry in the presence of substantial differences in quark masses is pointed out. This suggests that there is no need to invoke an intrinsic strange quark component in the proton wave function.</p>

				<title>Some observations on interpolating gauges and non-covariant gauges</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0949-0953</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the viability of using interpolating gauges to deﬁne the non-covariant gauges starting from the covariant ones. We draw attention to the need for a very careful treatment of boundary condition deﬁning term. We show that the boundary condition needed to maintain gauge-invariance as the interpolating parameter $\theta$ varies, depends very sensitively on the parameter variation. We do this with a gauge used by Doust. We also consider the Lagrangian path-integrals in Minkowski space for gauges with a residual gauge-invariance. We point out the necessity of inclusion of an $\epsilon$-term (even) in the formal treatments, without which one may reach incorrect conclusions. We, further, point out that the $\epsilon$-term can contribute to the BRST WT-identities in a non-trivial way (even as $\epsilon \to 0$). We point out that these contributions lead to additional constraints on Green’s function that are not normally taken into account in the BRST formalism that ignores the $\epsilon$-term, and that they are characteristic of the way the singularities in propagators are handled. We argue that a prescription, in general, will require renormalization; if at all it is to be viable.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The transversity distribution of quarks in a nucleon is one of the three fundamental distributions, that characterize nucleon’s properties in hard scattering processes at leading twist (twist 2). It measures the distribution of quark transverse spin in a nucleon polarized transverse to its (inﬁnite) momentum. It is a chiral-odd twist-two distribution function – gluons do not couple to it. Quarks in a nucleon/hadron are relativistically bound and transversity is a measure of the relativistic nature of bound quarks in a nucleon. In this work, we review some important aspects of this less familiar distribution function which has not been measured experimentally so far.</p>

Because of the large momentum transfer, these reactions occur at length scales less than the size of the hadrons. We explore whether they are best described in terms of the quark–gluon picture or the meson-exchange picture. Comparing our results with the available experimental data we conclude that the spin-averaged cross-sections are best described in meson-exchange picture. The description of the observed nucleon–nucleus and hyperon–nucleus spin-orbit potentials are found to be consistent with the quark–gluon exchange picture.</p>

The bare wave function is constructed as a product of two color-singlet three-quark clusters and then it is properly antisymmetrized by considering appropriate exchange operators for spin, ﬂavor and color. Color magnetic energy due to gluon exchange, meson self energy and energy correction due to center of mass motion are computed.

					<p>We study the baryon transverse in-plane (sideward) and elliptic ﬂow from SIS to AGS energies for Au+Au collisions in a relativistic dynamical simulation model that includes all baryon resonances up to a mass of 2 GeV as well as string degrees of freedom for the higher mass continuum. There are two factors which dominantly determine the baryon ﬂow at these energies: the momentum dependence of the scalar and vector potentials and the resonance-string degrees of freedom. We ﬁx the explicit momentum dependence of the nucleon–meson couplings of NL3(hard) equation of state (EoS) by the nucleon optical potential up to 1 GeV of kinetic energy. We simultaneously reproduce the sideward ﬂow, the elliptic ﬂow and the radial transverse mass distribution of protons data at AGS energies. In order to study the sensitivity of different mean-ﬁeld EoS, we use NL2(soft) and NL23(medium) along with NL3(hard) momenta-dependent mean-ﬁeld EoS. We ﬁnd that to describe data on both sideward and elliptic ﬂow, NL3 model is better at 2 A$\cdot$GeV, while NL23 model is at 4–8 A$\cdot$GeV.</p>

				<title>Effect of pre-existing baryon inhomogeneities on the dynamics of quark–hadron transition</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>1033-1037</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Baryon number inhomogeneities may be generated during the epoch when the baryon asymmetry of the universe is produced, e.g. at the electroweak phase transition. These lumps will have a lower temperature than the background. Also the value of $T_{c}$ will be different in these regions. Since a ﬁrst-order quark–hadron (Q–H) transition is susceptible to small changes in temperature, we investigate the effect of the presence of such baryonic lumps on the dynamics of the Q–H transition. We ﬁnd that the phase transition is delayed in these lumps for signiﬁcant overdensities. Consequently, we argue that baryon concentration in these regions grows by the end of the transition. We mention some models which may give rise to such high baryon overdensities before the Q–H transition.</p>

				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>We show that cosmic strings moving through the plasma at the time of a ﬁrst-order quark–hadron transition in the early universe generate baryon inhomogeneities, which can survive till the nucleosynthesis epoch. We ﬁnd out how these inhomogeneities actually affect the calculated values of the light element abundances. Recently a wealth of observational data from various experiments have helped to reduce the uncertainties in the values of these abundances. Using these we show that it is possible to derive constraints in the presence of cosmic strings during the quark–hadron transition.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study the exact solutions of the cascade three-level atom interacting with a single mode classical and quantized ﬁeld with different initial conditions ofthe atom. For the semiclassical model, it is found that if the atom is initially in the middle level, the time-dependent populations of the upper and lower levels are always equal. This dynamical symmetry exhibited by the classical ﬁeld is spoiled on quantization of the ﬁeld mode. To reveal this non-classical effect, a Euler matrix formalism is developed to solve the dressed states of the cascade Jaynes–Cummings model (JCM). Possible modiﬁcation of such an effect on the collapse and revival phenomenon is also discussed by taking the quantized ﬁeld in a coherent state.</p>

				<title>A DC excited waveguide multibeam CO$_{2}$ laser using high frequency pre-ionization technique</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1101-1107</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High power industrial multibeam CO$_{2}$ lasers consist of a large number of closely packed parallel glass discharge tubes sharing a common plane parallel resonator. Every discharge tube forms an independent resonator. When discharge tubes of smaller diameter are used and the Fresnel number $N \ll 1$ for all resonators, they operate in waveguide mode. Waveguide modes have excellent discrimination of higher order modes. A DC excited waveguide multibeam CO$_{2}$ laser is reported having six glass discharge tubes. Simultaneous excitation of DC discharge in all sections is achieved by producing pre-ionization using an auxiliary high frequency pulsed discharge along with its other advantages. Maximum 170 W output power is obtained with all beams operating in EH$_{11}$ waveguide mode. The speciﬁc power of 28 W/m is much higher as compared to similar AC excited waveguide multibeam CO$_{2}$ lasers. Theoretical analysis shows that all resonators of this laser will support only EH$_{11}$ mode. This laser is successfully used for woodcutting.</p>

The torch was operated at power levels from 4 to 20 kW in non-transferred arc mode. The effect of nitrogen in combination with argon as plasma gas on the above properties was investigated. Calculations were made from experimental data. The electrothermal efﬁciency increased signiﬁcantly with increase in nitrogen content. The plasma jet temperature and thermal conductivity exhibited a decrease with increase in nitrogen content. The experiment was done at different total gas ﬂow rates.

Since this line lies in the water window spectral region, it has potential application in x-ray microscopic imaging of biological sample in wet condition.

				<title>Magnetic relaxation in a three-dimensional ferromagnet with weak quenched random-exchange disorder</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1129-1144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Isothermal remanent magnetization decay, $M_{r}(t)$, and ‘in-ﬁeld’ growth of zero-ﬁeld-cooled magnetization, $M_{\text{ZFC}}(t)$, with time have been measured over four decades in time at temperatures ranging from $0.25T_{\text{c}}$ to $1.25T_{\text{c}}$ (where $T_{\text{c}}$ is the Curie temperature, determined previously for the same sample from static critical phenomena measurements) for a nearly ordered intermetallic compound Ni$_{3}$Al, which is an experimental realization of a three-dimensional $(d= 3)$ ferromagnet with weak quenched random-exchange disorder. None of the functional forms of $M_{\text{r}}(t)$ predicted by the existing phenomenological models of relaxation dynamics in spin systems with quenched randomness, but only the expressions $M_{\text{r}}(t)=M_{0}[M_{1}\exp (-t/\tau_{1})+(t/\tau_{2})^{-\alpha}]$ and $M_{\text{ZFC}}(t)=M'_{0}[1-\{M'_{1}\exp(-t/\tau'_{1})+(t/\tau'_{2})^{-\alpha'}\}]$ closely reproduce such data in the present case. The most striking features of magnetic relaxation in the system in question are as follows: Aging effects are absent in both $M_{\text{r}}(t)$ and $M_{\text{ZFC}}(t)$ at all temperatures in the temperature range covered in the present experiments. A cross-over in equilibrium dynamics from the one, characteristic of a pure $d = 3$ ferromagnet with complete atomic ordering and prevalent at temperatures away from $T_{\text{c}}$, to that, typical of a $d = 3$ random-exchange ferromagnet, occurs as $T \to T_{\text{c}}$. The relaxation times $\tau_{1}(T)(\tau'_{1}(T))$ and $\tau_{2}(T)(\tau'_{2}(T))$ exhibit logarithmic divergence at critical temperatures $T^{\tau_{1}}_{\text{c}}(T^{\tau'_{1}}_{\text{c}}(H))$ and $T^{\tau_{2}}_{\text{c}}(T^{\tau'_{2}}_{\text{c}}(H))$; $T^{\tau'_{1}}_{\text{c}}$ and $T^{\tau'_{2}}_{\text{c}}$ both increase with the external magnetic ﬁeld strength, $H$, such that at any given ﬁeld value, $T^{\tau'_{1}}_{\text{c}}=T^{\tau'_{2}}_{\text{c}}$. The exponent characterizing the logarithmic divergence in $\tau'_{1}(T)$ and $\tau'_{2}(T)$ possesses a ﬁeld-independent value of $\simeq 16$ for both relaxation times. Of all the available theoretical models, the droplet ﬂuctuation model alone provides a qualitative explanation for some aspects of the present magnetic relaxation data.</p>

				<title>Dynamical interplay between ﬂuctuations, electric ﬁelds and transport in fusion plasmas</title>
				<feature>Special Section</feature>
				<page>1163-1169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A view of recent experimental results and progress in the characterization of the statistical properties of electrostatic turbulence in magnetically conﬁned devices is given. An empirical similarity in the scaling properties of the probability distribution function (PDF) of turbulent transport has been observed in the plasma edge region in fusion plasmas. The investigation of the dynamical interplay between ﬂuctuation in gradients, turbulent transport and radial electric ﬁelds has shown that these parameters are strongly coupled both in tokamak and stellarator plasmas. The bursty behaviour of turbulent transport is linked with a departure from the most probable radial gradient. The dynamical relation between ﬂuctuations in gradients and transport is strongly affected by the presence of sheared poloidal ﬂows which organized themselves near marginal stability. These results emphasize the importance of the statistical description of transport processes in fusion plasmas as an alternative approach to the traditional way to characterize transport based on the computation of effective transport coefﬁcients.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, as an example of an application of the plasma focus (PF) device, we study the inﬂuence on alloys of vanadium of a cumulative ﬂow producing in the PF device. The experiment was done in a 4-kJ PF device with various gas ﬁllings and various anode shapes. It was found that the velocity of the axial cumulative ﬂow depends on the type of gas and is about $5\cdot 10^{7}$ cm/s for deuterium and $2\cdot 10^{7}$ cm/s for argon ﬁllings of plasma focus chamber; the shape of the ﬂow is changed from a broad conical ﬂy for deuterium to a quasi-one-directional stream for argon. The dynamics and structure of such ﬂows are investigated by means of laser diagnostics and an image converter camera.</p>
					<p>The experiments show that cumulative ﬂows produce various defects in tested samples. The appearance of a large number of cracks on the surface of vanadium under the impulse inﬂuence of deuterium plasma shows that pure vanadium cannot be used for the construction of thermonuclear fusion reactors.</p>
					<p>Such PF installations could also be used effectively for the study of other material and construction elements proposed for the use in thermonuclear machines.</p>

				<feature>Special Section</feature>
				<page>1197-1201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a dusty plasma, the non-adiabaticity of the charge variation on a dust grain surface results in an anomalous dissipation. Analytical investigation shows that this results in a small but ﬁnite amplitude dust acoustic (DA) wave propagation which is described by the Korteweg–de Vries–Burger equation. Results of the numerical investigation of the propagation of large-amplitude dust acoustic stationary shock wave are presented here using the complete set of non-linear dust ﬂuid equations coupled with the dust charging equation and Poisson equation. The DA waves are of compressional type showing considerable increase of dust density, which is of signiﬁcant importance in astrophysical context as it leads to enhanced gravitational attraction considered as a viable process for star formation. The DA shock transition to its far downstream amplitude is oscillatory in nature due to dust charge ﬂuctuations, the oscillation amplitude and shock width depending on the ratio $\omega_{\text{pd}}/\nu_{\text{ch}}$ and other plasma parameters.</p>

				<title>Centrifugal acceleration of plasma in pulsar magnetosphere</title>
				<feature>Special Section</feature>
				<page>1203-1207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a relativistic model for the centrifugal acceleration of plasma bunches and the coherent radio emission in pulsar magnetosphere. We ﬁnd that rotation broadens the width of leading component compared to the width of trailing component. We explain this difference in the component widths using the nested cone emission geometry. We estimate the effect of pulsar spin on the Stokes parameters, and ﬁnd that the inclination between the rotation and magnetic axes can introduce an asymmetry in the circular polarization of the conal components. We analyse the single pulse polarization data of PSR B0329+54 at 606 MHz, and ﬁnd that in its conal components, one sense of circular polarization dominates in the leading component while the other sense dominates in the trailing component. Our simulation shows that changing the sign of the impact parameter changes the sense of circular polarization as well as the swing of polarization angle.</p>

				<feature>Special Section</feature>
				<page>1209-1214</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using ﬂuid theory, a set of equations is derived for non-linear high-frequency waves propagating oblique to an external magnetic ﬁeld in a three-component plasma consisting of hot electrons, cold electrons and cold ions. For parameters typical of the Earth’s magnetosphere, numerical solutions of the governing equations yield sinusoidal, sawtooth or bipolar wave-forms for the electric ﬁeld.</p>

				<title>Effect of ionized plasma medium on the radiation from a RITMA structure on ferrite substrate</title>
				<feature>Special Section</feature>
				<page>1215-1218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents theoretical investigations on the radiation properties of a right isosceles triangular microstrip antenna (RITMA) printed on a magnetized ferrite substrate Ni$_{0.62}$Co$_{0.02}$Fe$_{1.948}$O$_{4}$ in the presence of ionized plasma medium. The theoretical study on RITMA structure in free space is carried out in TM$_{11}$ mode of excitation by applying cavity model-based modal expansion technique while hydrodynamic theory is used for its analysis in plasma medium. By varying the bias magnetic ﬁeld, far-ﬁeld radiation patterns in free space and plasma medium are obtained which in turn are applied in computing radiated power, directivity, quality factor and bandwidth of antenna. It is found that the presence of plasma medium affects the performance of RITMA structure signiﬁcantly.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Integrability of a linearly damped two-coupled non-linear oscillators equation 
					\begin{align*}
					\ddot{x} &= -d\dot{x} -\alpha x -\delta_{1}(x^{2}+y^{2})-2\delta_{2}xy,\\
					\ddot{y} &= -d\dot{y}-\beta y - \delta_{2}(x^{2}+y^{2})-2\delta_{1}xy
					\end{align*}
					is investigated by employing the Painlevé analysis. The following two integrable cases are identified: (i) $d=0$, $\alpha=\beta$, $\delta_{1}$ and $\delta_{2}$ are arbitrary. (ii) $d^{2}=25\alpha/6$, $\alpha=\beta$, $\delta_{1}$ and $\delta_{2}$ are arbitrary. Exact analytical solution is constructed for the integrable choices.

				<title>Supersymmetry at D$\emptyset$ and other new phenomena searches in Run II</title>
				<feature>Experimental Particle Physics</feature>
				<page>0537-0540</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Run II of the D$\emptyset$  experiment was started in March 2001. The first preliminary results on searches for new physics are presented, with a luminosity of  $\sim$ 10 pb$^{-1}$ from the data collected in 2001–2002. We report results in mSUGRA (jets + missing $E_{\rm T}$ channel), GMSB (diphotons), RPV (trileptons and like sign dileptons) and large extra dimensions (dielectrons and diphotons).</p>

				<feature>Experimental Particle Physics</feature>
				<page>0541-0544</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An extensive effort to search for a hint of a supersymmetric signal was carried out by the four LEP Collaborations. All LEP data, up to centre-of-mass energy of 209 GeV, was carefully analysed with no observed SUSY signal. In an attempt to further increase the sensitivity of the search, the four groups combined some of their searches, to no avail.</p>

				<title>LEP Higgs boson searches beyond the standard model and minimum supersymmetric standard model</title>
				<feature>Experimental Particle Physics</feature>
				<page>0545-0550</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ever since the center-of-mass energy was increased in 1995 above the  $Z^{0}$ resonance, the four LEP experiments (ALEPH, DELPHI, OPAL and L3) have renewed their effort to search for the Higgs boson. Data taking ended in the year 2000 with about 130 pb$^{-1}$ f data collected per experiment above 206 GeV in $e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions but the data analysis is still very active. Most recently, the wealth of theoretical models and predictions has stimulated new analyses and model interpretations which go beyond the standard model and minimal supersymmetric standard model. These include the searches for charged Higgs bosons, models with two Higgs field doublets, searches for ‘fermiophobic’ Higgs decay, invisible Higgs boson decays, decay-mode independent searches, and limits on Yukawa and anomalous Higgs couplings. I review the searches done by the four LEP experiments and present the LEP combined results when they exist.</p>

				<title>Neutral Higgs bosons in the standard model and in the minimal supersymmetric model: Searches at LEP</title>
				<feature>Experimental Particle Physics</feature>
				<page>0555-0560</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the twelve years of operation of the $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider LEP, the associated collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have extensively searched for Higgs bosons over a broad range of masses. We present the final results from LEP for the standard model Higgs boson which are obtained from a statistical combination of the data from the four experiments. We also present preliminary combined results for neutral Higgs bosons in the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) where the Higgs sector is assumed to be CP invariant. Finally, we discuss an alternative MSSM scenario including CP violation in the Higgs sector.</p>

				<title>Search for narrow-width $t\bar{t}$ resonances in $p\bar{p}$ collisons at $\sqrt(s)=1.8$ TeV</title>
				<feature>Experimental Particle Physics</feature>
				<page>0561-0564</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a preliminary result on a search for narrow-width resonances that decay into $t\bar{t}$ pairs using 130 pb$^{-1}$ of lepton + jets data in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =1.8$ TeV. No significant deviation is observed from prediction of the standard model, and upper limits at $95\%$ confidence on the product of the production cross-section and its branching fraction to $t\bar{t}$ are presented for narrow-width resonances, as a function of resonance mass $M_{X}$. We also use these limits to exclude the existence of a leptophobic top-color particle $X$, with $M_{X} &#60; 560$  GeV/c$^{2}$ and width ${\Gamma_X} = 0.012 M_{X}$.</p>

				<feature>Experimental Particle Physics</feature>
				<page>0569-0572</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measuring the angle $\gamma$ of the unitarity triangle is an important part of over-constraining the standard model's explanation of CP violation and testing for new physics contributions to CP violation. Although there are many ways to measure $\gamma$, all of them have significant experimental or theoretical challenges. This talk presents progress at the BABAR experiment toward measuring $\gamma$ using $B$ meson decays.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We summarize results on a number of observations of penguin dominated radiative decays of the $B$ meson. Such decays are forbidden at tree level and proceed via electroweak loops. As such they may be sensitive to physics beyond the standard model. The observations have been made at the BaBar experiment at PEP-II, the asymmetric $B$ factory at SLAC.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Semileptonic decays of $B \rightarrow X_u \ell \nu$ have great importance both from theoretical and experimental point of view, as they are useful for extracting the magnitude of $V_{ub}$, one of the tiniest elements of CKM matrix. Similarly measurement of $B \rightarrow D_{s}X_{u}$ can be used to calculate $V_{ub}$. The Belle Collaboration has measured these branching ratios and extracted $V_{ub}$ for various theoretical models.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We observe 147 events of the axial vector pair $K_{1} (1270) - K_{1} (1400)$ produced in the Coulomb field of a Pb target and measure the radiative widths $\Lambda (K_{1} (1400) \rightarrow K^{0} + \gamma) = 280.8 \pm 23.2$ (stat.) $\pm (40.4)$ (syst.) keV and $\Lambda (K_{1} (1270) \rightarrow K^{0} + \gamma) = 73.2 \pm 6.1$ (stat.) $\pm 28.3$ (syst.) keV. These first measurements are lower than the quark-model predictions. We also place upper limits on the radiative widths for $K^{*} (1410)$ and $K_{2}^{*} (1430)$ and find that the letter is very small in accord with $SU(3)$ invariance in the naive quark model.</p>

				<page>0611-0614</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent discoveries in the neutrino sector have opened a new frontier in high-energy physics and cosmology. Evidence from neutrino oscillation experiments from around the world indicate that neutrinos oscillate between their different flavours and therefore may have mass. In addition, results from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments as well as the accelerator neutrino experiment, LSND, cannot all be explained with the three standard model neutrinos. Is this new physics or is there some other explanation? The MiniBooNE experiment presently taking data at Fermilab is designed to address the LSND signal and answer this question. Progress on the MiniBooNE experiment will be presented and prospects for the future will be discussed.</p>

				<title>Latest results on $J/\phi$ anomalous suppression</title>
				<feature>Experimental Particle Physics</feature>
				<page>0627-0630</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The NA50 experiment deals with Pb–Pb collisions at 158 GeV/nucleon at the CERN SPS accelerator. The $J/\phi$ production is studied through the muon decay channel, using the Drell–Yan dimuons as a reference. New results based on recent analyses, from data taken with improved experimental conditions and using different centrality estimators, are presented and compared to an update of those already obtained from previous data samples. The stepwise pattern of the anomalous $J/\phi$ suppression as a function of centrality, already present in these previous results, is confirmed. This observation could be a fingerprint of the theoretically predicted melting of charmonia resonances in a deconfined quark–gluon plasma.</p>

				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0025-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The combination of molecular dynamics simulations and neutron scattering measurements on three different glass-forming polymers (polyisoprene, poly(vinyl ethylene) and polybutadiene) has allowed to establish the existence of a crossover from Gaussian to non-Gaussian behavior for the incoherent scattering function in the $\alpha$-relaxation regime. The deviation from Gaussian behavior observed can be reproduced assuming the existence of a distribution of discrete jump lengths underlying the sublinear diffusion of the atomic motions during the structural relaxation.</p>

				<title>Crossover from Rouse dynamics to the $\alpha$-relaxation in poly(vinyl ethylene)</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0033-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By means of neutron spin echo ({\bf NSE}) we have explored the dynamics of poly(vinyl ethylene) on length scales covering Rouse dynamics and below. The results establish the simultaneous existence of a generic sublinear diffusion regime which underlies the $\alpha$-process in addition to the Rouse process. Both regimes are separated by a well-defined dynamic crossover. From that the size of the Gaussian blobs making up the Rouse model is determined directly. The glassy dynamics may thus be identified with subdiffusive motions occurring within these Gaussian blobs.</p>

				<title>The structure of molten ZnCl$_{2}$ : A new analysis of some old data</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0041-0050</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using a recently derived method, based on empirical potential structure refinement ({\bf EPSR}), the structure of molten zinc chloride ({\bf ZnCl$_{2}$) is re-analysed. Contrary to the picture given in some early analyses, the results indicate that there are significant uncertainties in the extracted site–site radial distribution functions, particularly the Zn–Zn distribution. These are derived from the small weighting of this partial structure factor in the measured diffraction data and from systematic uncertainties in the original data. The simulated atom distributions are used to discuss the three-dimensional structure of this molten salt.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Charge neutrality, a spin $\dfrac{1}{2}$ and an associated magnetic moment of the neutron make it an ideal probe of quantal spinor evolutions. Polarized neutron interferometry in magnetic field Hamiltonians has thus scored several firsts such as direct verification of Pauli anticommutation, experimental separation of geometric and dynamical phases and observation of non-cyclic amplitudes and phases. This paper provides a flavour of the physics learnt from such experiments.</p>

				<title>AMOR – the time-of-flight neutron reflectometer at SINQ/PSI</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0057-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The apparatus for multioptional reflectometry ({\bf AMOR}) at {\bf SINQ/PSI} is a versatile reflectometer operational in the time-of-flight ({\bf TOF}) mode (in a wavelength range of 0.15 nm $&#62; \lambda &#62;$ 1.3 nm) as well as in the monochromatic ($\theta - 2\theta$) mode with both polarized and unpolarized neutrons. {\bf AMOR} is designed to perform reflectometry measurements in horizontal sample-plane geometry which allows studying both solid–liquid and liquid–liquid interfaces. A pulsed cold neutron beam from the end position of the neutron guide is produced by a dual-chopper system (side-by-side) having two windows at $180^{\circ}$ and rotatable with a maximum frequency of {\bf 200 Hz}. In the {\bf TOF} mode, the chopper frequency, width of the gating window and the chopper–detector distance can be selected independently providing a wide range of $q$-resolution ($\Delta q/q = 1–10\%$). Remanent {\bf FeCoV/Ti : N} supermirrors are used as polarizer/analyzer with a polarization efficiency of $\sim 97\%$. For the monochromatic wavelength mode, a {\bf Ni/Ti} multilayer is used as a monochromator, giving $\sim 50\%$ reflectivity at a wavelength of 0.47 nm. In the present work, a detailed description of the instrument and setting-up of the polarization option is described. Results from some of the recent studies with polarized neutrons and measurements on liquid surfaces are presented.</p>

The structure (shape and size) and the interaction of these aggregates, referred to as micelles, depend on the molecular architecture of the surfactant molecule, presence of additives and the solution conditions such as temperature, concentration etc. This paper gives the usefulness of small-angle neutron scattering to the study of micellar solutions with some of our recent results.</p>

				<title>Inelastic neutron scattering and lattice dynamics studies in complex solids</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0073-0079</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At Trombay, lattice dynamics studies employing coherent inelastic neutron scattering ({\bf INS}) experiments have been carried out at the two research reactors, {\bf CIRUS} and Dhruva. While the early work at {\bf CIRUS} involved many elemental solids and ionic molecular solids, recent experiments at Dhruva have focussed on certain superconductors (cuprates and intermetallics), geophysically important minerals ({\bf Al$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$, ZrSiO$_{4}$, MnCO$_{3}$}) and layered halides ({\bf BaFCl, ZnCl$_{2}$}). In most of the studies, theoretical modelling of lattice dynamics has played a signi¯cant role in the interpretation and analysis of the results from experiments. This talk summarises the developments and current activities in the ¯eld of inelastic neutron scattering and lattice dynamics at Trombay.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Quasi-elastic neutron scattering ({\bf QENS}) technique, known to study stochastic motions has been successfully used to elucidate the molecular motions and physical properties related to them, in a variety of systems. {\bf QENS} is a unique technique that provides information on the time-scale of the motion as well as the geometry of the motions. In this paper, results of some of the systems studied using the facility available at Dhruva, Trombay and other mega-facilities are discussed. Emphasis is given on the results obtained from three di®erent systems studied using {\bf QENS}, namely, (1) alkyl chain motions in monolayer protected metal clusters, (2) molecular motions of propane in {\bf Na-Y} zeolitic systems and (3) the study of reorientational motions of liquid crystal in $n${\bf O.}$m$ series in di®erent mesophases.</p>

				<title>Internal motions in proteins: A combined neutron scattering and molecular modelling approach</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0091-0097</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well-known that water plays a major role in the stability and catalytic function of proteins. Both the e®ect of hydration water on the dynamics of proteins and that of proteins on the dynamics of water have been studied using inelastic neutron scattering. Inelastic neutron scattering is the most direct probe of di®usive protein dynamics on the picosecond{nanosecond time-scale. We present here results relative to a photosynthetic globular protein, the {\bf C}-phycocyanin, that can be obtained in protonated and deuterated forms. Di®usive motions have been studied using the protonated {\bf C}-phycocyanin, protein. Molecular dynamics simulation and analytical theory have been combined to analyse the data and get a detailed description of diffusive motions for protein. The simulation-derived dynamic structure factors are in good agreement with experiment. The dynamical parameters are shown to present a smooth variation with distance from the core of the protein. The collective dynamics has been investigated using the fully deuterated {\bf C}-phycocyanin protein. Both the experimental and calculated spectra exhibit a dynamic relaxation with a characteristic time of about 10 ps.</p>

					<p>Neutron diffraction provides an experimental method of directly locating hydrogen atoms in proteins. After developing an original neutron detector (neutron imaging plate) and a novel practical neutron monochromator (elastically bent perfect Si monochromator), {\bf BIX}-type diffractometers which were equipped with these tools were e±ciently constructed at {\bf JRR-3} in Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute ({\bf JAERI}), Japan and they have ¯nished many protein crystallographic measurements and interesting results have come one after another. At the same time a method of growing large protein single crystals and a database of hydrogen and hydration have also been developed. In the near future, a pulsed neutron diffractometer for biological macromolecules has been proposed at {\bf J-PARC} in {\bf JAERI}.</p>

				<title>Partial magnetic order in the itinerant-electron magnet MnSi</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0117-0123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>{\bf MnSi} is an itinerant ferromagnet with a long-wavelength helical modulation of the spin structure. Macroscopic measurements suggest that the ordering temperature $T_{c}$ is reduced with increasing pressure from $T_{c} = 30$ K at $p = 0$ to zero at the critical pressure $p_{c} = 14.6$ kbar. Resistivity measurements show that {\bf MnSi} enters a non-Fermi liquid state at $p_{c}$, which remains to be understood. Neutron scattering techniques have been used to investigate the magnetic structure at and above $p_{c}$, i.e. triple-axis spectrometry and small angle neutron scattering. Surprisingly, sizeable quasi-static moments were found to survive to pressures considerably above $p_{c}$. They are, however, organized in a highly unusual way such that the magnetic Bragg re°ections are sharp in the longitudinal direction but are very broad in the transverse direction, implying a partial magnetic order that was never seen before.</p>

				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0125-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A brief account of applications of polarized inelastic neutron scattering in condensed matter research is given. We show that full polarization analysis is the only tool allowing to discriminate unambiguously between di®erent magnetic modes in various magnetic materials. We show by means of recent results in the Heisenberg ferromagnet EuS that the effects of dipolar interactions can be studied on a microscopic scale. Moreover, we have found for the ¯rst time indications for the divergence of the longitudinal fluctuations below $T_{c}$. In the itinerant antiferromagnet chromium we demonstrate that the dynamics of the longitudinal and transverse excitations are very di®erent, resolving a long standing puzzle concerning the slope of their dispersion. Finally, we show that a measurement of the polarization-dependent part of the cross section of non-centrosymmetric {\bf MnSi} proves directly that the chirality of the magnetic °uctuations is left-handed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated magnetic correlations in various {\bf CMR} manganites on macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic length scales by carrying out {\bf DC} magnetization, neutron depolarization, and neutron diffraction measurements. We present here the e®ect of substituting {\bf Mn} with {\bf Fe} and {\bf La} with {\bf Dy} in the ferromagnetic {\bf La$_{0.7-x}$ Ca$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ ($x \sim 0.3 - 0.33)} compounds. Neutron diffraction has been used in order to characterize the long-range magnetic order and its gradual suppression by the substitution. Neutron depolarization study has been carried out in order to bridge the gap in our understanding regarding the nature of magnetic correlation obtained from the macroscopic and microscopic measurements. In particular, our study on {\bf La$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$Mn$_{0.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$O$_{3}$ has established the fact that a true double exchange mediated spin-glass is insulating. In another study of {\bf La}-site ionic size e®ect and its disorder in {\bf (La$_{1-x}$Dy$_{x}$)$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$}, we have investigated the evolution of the length scale of magnetic ordering with a possible microscopic explanation and the results have been compared with that for the light rare earth substituted compounds.</p>

				<title>Characterization of porous materials by small-angle scattering</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks</feature>
				<page>0165-0173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Characterization of porous materials by small-angle scattering has been extensively pursued for several years now as the pores are often of mesoscopic size and compatible with the length scale accessible by the technique using both neutrons and X-rays as probing radiation. With the availability of ultra small-angle scattering instruments, one can investigate porous materials in the sub-micron length scale. Because of the increased accessible length scale vis-a-vis the multiple scattering effect, conventional data analysis procedures based on single scattering approximation quite often fail. The limitation of conventional data analysis procedures is also pronounced in the case of thick samples and long wavelength of the probing radiation. Effect of multiple scattering is manifested by broadening the scattering profile. Sample thickness for some technologically important materials is often significantly high, as the experimental samples have to replicate all its essential properties in the bulk material. Larger wavelength of the probing radiation is used in some cases to access large length scale and also to minimize the effect of double Bragg reflections.</p>

				<title>A possibility of parallel and anti-parallel diffraction measurements on neutron diffractometer employing bent perfect crystal monochromator at the monochromatic focusing condition</title>

				<page>0175-0181</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a conventional diffractometer having single monochromator, only one position, parallel position, is used for the diffraction experiment (i.e. detection) because the resolution property of the other one, anti-parallel position, is very poor. However, a bent perfect crystal ({\bf BPC}) monochromator at monochromatic focusing condition can provide a quite flat and equal resolution property at both parallel and anti-parallel positions and thus one can have a chance to use both sides for the diffraction experiment. From the data of the {\bf FWHM} and the $\Delta d/d$ measured on three diffraction geometries (symmetric, asymmetric compression and asymmetric expansion), we can conclude that the simultaneous diffraction measurement in both parallel and anti-parallel positions can be achieved.</p>

					<p>The study of changes in the structure ({\bf H}-bonded) of liquid alcohols at elevated temperatures is rare probably due to low flash points of these liquids. An indigenously devised special quartz cell is now used to carry out the structural studies of these liquids at elevated temperatures through neutron diffraction. Here, the liquid consists of deuterated methanol and neutron data was collected on the high-$Q$ diffractometer at Dhruva, {\bf BARC}. The corrected data at elevated temperatures ({\bf BP} (boiling point) and double the {\bf BP}) show that there is a large change in the {\bf H}-bonded structure of this liquid. The pre-peak or hump, known to be signature of {\bf H}-bonded clusters appears to be present at all the three temperatures studied. In the low-$Q$ (scattering vector) data Ornstein-Zernike ({\bf OZ}) behaviour is also observed. It is, however, seen that the intramolecular structure does not change very much at higher temperatures. A detailed model analysis is in progress and would be reported later.</p>

				<title>Structural study and electrical properties of Zr-doped Nd$_{2}$Sn$_{2}$O$_{7}$ pyrochlore compounds</title>
				<feature>Neutron diffraction</feature>
				<page>0189-0197</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nd$_{2}$Sn$_{2}$O$_{7}$ pyrochlores with the substitution of Zr$^{4+}$ were prepared by conventional ceramic double sintering technique. The single-phase formation was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction techniques. Relative intensity calculations for X-ray diffraction analysis were performed for oxygen positional parameters $x = 0.331$ and 0.375, while Rietveld refinements were employed for neutron di®raction data. The neutron diffraction study revealed that there are only two anion sites with 48f and 8b positions. This indicates that the 8a site, i.e. {\bf O(3)} sublattice, is completely vacant and the structure is a perfect cubic pyrochlore with space group Fd3m (O$_{h}^{7}$).</p>
					<p>From the conductivity measurements, it is observed that the electronic conductivity dominates from room temperature up to about {\bf 525 K} and for {\bf $T &#62; 525 K}, the oxygen ion conduction dominates the charge transport in these compositions. Complex impedance spectroscopy indicates the existence of grain and grain boundary as two separate elements.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Crystal structure and magnetic behaviour of {\bf FeCrP} have been investigated using magnetization and neutron di®raction measurements. {\bf FeCrP} crystallizes in orthorhombic {\bf FeZrP} type structure ($P_{\text{nma}}$ space group, $Z = 4$) in which {\bf Cr} atoms occupy the pyramidal site and Fe atoms occupy the tetrahedral site with total preference. Structural parameters including positional parameters have been refined. The refined values of positional parameters for {\bf Fe} and {\bf Cr} are quite different from those in {\bf FeZrP}. The nature of magnetization{temperature curve is suggestive of antiferromagnetic nature with {\bf $T_{N} = 280 (\pm 10)$ K}. Preliminary analysis of neutron diffraction pattern at {\bf 13 K} is indicative of a rather complicated magnetic structure.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The structure and the magnetic properties of the doped rare earth cobaltite systems are of recent interest owing to the {\bf CMR} phenomenon that occur in them. In this paper, we investigate the structure and magnetic properties of {\bf Tb$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_{3}$} solid solution, for the first time, using neutron powder di®raction technique. The sample {\bf Tb$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_{3}$} is found to crystallize in orthorhombic ({\bf Pbnm}) symmetry. The unit cell volume and {\bf Co-O} bond length reduce with temperature. The calculated $e_{g}$ bandwidth obtained from structural parameters turns out to be {\bf 0.989 eV}. Low temperature neutron diffraction profiles exhibit a magnetic contribution to the fundamental Bragg peaks indicating a ferromagnetic ordering below $T_{c}$. The results are compared with {\bf Co-O-Co} bond angles and {\bf Co-O} bond length of {\bf La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_{3}$, highlighting the ionic size effects on substitution of {\bf Tb} ion for {\bf La} in the compound.</p>

					<p>The {\bf HgO}-added {\bf YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO)} superconductor has been studied for its structural and superconducting properties. Polycrystalline {\bf YBCO} samples were synthesized through solid-state reaction method by adding {\bf HgO} in different concentrations without using oxygen annealing. All the samples showed a sharp superconducting transition temperature around {\bf 90 K}. The X-ray diffraction patterns of all the samples revealed monophasic {\bf Y-123} nature. The structural studies were carried out by neutron scattering and Rietveld analysis. The neutron scattering revealed that {\bf Hg} is not incorporated in the {\bf Y-123} system and has shown optimum oxygen concentration. The significant role played by the {\bf HgO} is to provide oxygen ambient through its decomposition, thus changing the oxygen balance in favour of high {\bf Cu}-valence state.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the magnetic structure of {\bf Fe[Fe(CN)$_{6}$]·4H$_{2}$O}, prepared by precipitation method, using neutron diffraction technique. Temperature dependent {\bf DC} magnetization study down to {\bf 4.2 K} shows that the compound undergoes from a high temperature disordered (paramagnetic) to an ordered magnetic phase transition at {\bf 22.6 K}. Rietveld analysis of neutron diffraction pattern at {\bf 60 K} (in its paramagnetic phase) revealed a face centred cubic structure with space group {\bf Fm3m}. The structure contains three-dimensional network of straight {\bf Fe$^{3+}$ –C$\equiv$N–Fe$^{3+}$} chains along the edges of the unit cell cube. $Fe$^{3+}$ ions occupy {\bf $4a (0, 0, 0)$} and {\bf $4b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$} positions. {\bf Fe$^{3+}$ (0, 0, 0)} is surrounded octahedrally by six nitrogen atoms and {\bf Fe$^{3+}$ (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)} is surrounded octahedrally by six carbon atoms. Magnetic Rietveld refinement of neutron diffraction data at {\bf 11 K} shows a ferromagnetic coupling between the two inequivalent {\bf Fe$^{3+}$} sites. Refinement yielded an ordered moment of {\bf 4.4(6)} and {\bf 0.8(6) $\mu_{\text{B}}$} per Fe ion located at {\bf (0, 0, 0)} and {\bf (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)}, respectively. Ordered moments are found to align along the face diagonal. The observed net moment from low temperature neutron diffraction study is consistent with {\bf DC} magnetization results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The basic result of carboxylic group that the oxygen atom of the {\bf –OH} never seems to be a hydrogen bond acceptor is violated in the cases, namely urea oxalic acid and bis urea oxalic acid complexes, where the hydroxyl oxygen atom is an acceptor of a weak {\bf N–H...

The bond strength around the hydroxyl oxygen is close to {\bf 1.91} valence units, indicating that it has hardly any strength left to form hydrogen bonds. These two structures being highly planar, force the formation of this hydrogen bond. As oxalic acid is the common moiety, the structures of the two polymorphs, $\alpha$-oxalic acid and $\beta$-oxalic acid, also were looked into in terms of hydrogen bonding and packing.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The state of intermolecular aggregates and that of folded gelatin molecules could be characterized by dynamic laser light and small-angle neutron scattering experiments, which implied spontaneous segregation of particle sizes preceding coacervation, which is a liquid-liquid phase transition phenomenon. Dynamic light scattering ({\bf DLS}) data analysis revealed two particle sizes until precipitation was reached. The smaller particles having a diameter of {\bf $\sim 50$ nm} (stable nanoparticles prepared by coacervation method) were detected in the supernatant, whereas the inter-molecular aggregates having a diameter of {\bf $\sim 400$ nm} gave rise to coacervation. Small-angle neutron scattering ({\bf SANS}) experiments revealed that typical mesh size of the networks exist in polymer dense phase (coacervates) [1]. Analysis of the {\bf SANS} structure factor showed the presence of two length scales associated with this system that were identified as the correlation length or mesh size, {\bf $\xi = 10.6$ Å} of the network and the other is the size of inhomogeneities = {\bf 21.4 Å}. Observations were discussed based on the results obtained from {\bf SANS} experiments performed in {\bf $5\%$ (w/v)} gelatin solution at {\bf $60^{\circ}$ C (\xi = 50 Å, \zeta = 113 Å)} and {\bf $5\%$ (w/v)} gel at {\bf $28^{\circ}$ C $(\xi = 47 Å, \zeta = 115 Å)$} in aqueous phase [2] indicating smaller length scales in coacervate as compared to sol and gel.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Microemulsions {\bf (MEs)} are of special interest because a variety of reactants can be introduced into the nanometer-sized aqueous domains, leading to materials with controlled size and shape {\bf[ 1,2]}. In the past few years, significant research has been conducted in the reverse {\bf ME}-mediated synthesis of organic nanoparticles {\bf [3,4]}. In this study, a w/o {\bf ME} medium was employed for the synthesis of lidocaine by direct precipitation in w/o microemulsion systems: water/isopropylpalmitat/Tween80/Span80. The particle size as well as the location of nanoparticles in the {\bf ME} droplet were characterized by means of dynamic light scattering {\bf (DLS)} and small angle neutron scattering {\bf (SANS)}. It is observed that lidocaine precipitated in the aqueous cores because of its insolubility in water. Hydrodynamic radius and gyration radius of microemulsion droplets were estimated as $\sim 15$ nm and $\sim 4.50$ nm from {\bf DLS} and {\bf SANS} respectively. Furthermore, different size parameters obtained by {\bf DLS} and {\bf SANS} experiments were compared</p>

					<p>Micellar solution of nonionic surfactant $n$-dodecyloligo ethyleneoxide surfactant, decaoxyethylene monododecyl ether  {\bf [CH$_{3}$(CH$_{2}$)$_{11}$(OCH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$)$_{10}$OH], C_{12}E_{10}$} in {\bf D$_{2}$O} solution have been analysed by small-angle neutron scattering {\bf (SANS)} at different temperatures {\bf (30, 45 and 60$^{\circ}$C)} both in the presence and absence of sugars. The structural parameters like micelle shape and size, aggregation number and micellar density have been determined. It is found that the micellar structure significantly depends on the temperature and concentration of sugars. The micelles are found to be prolate ellipsoids at {\bf 30$^{\circ}$C} and the axial ratio of the micelle increases with the increase in temperature. The presence of lower concentration of sugar reduces the size of micelles and it grows at higher concentration of sugar. The structure of micelles is almost independent of the different types of sugars used.</p>

				<title>Small-angle neutron scattering study of aggregate structures of multi-headed pyridinium surfactants in aqueous solution</title>
				<feature>Small-angle neutron scattering</feature>
				<page>0303-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aggregate structures of a set of novel single-chain surfactants bearing one, two and three pyridinium headgroups have been studied using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). It is found that the nature of aggregate structures of these cationic surfactants depend on the number of headgroups present in the surfactants. The single-headed pyridinium surfactant forms the lamellar structure, whereas surfactants with double and triple headgroups form micelles in water. The aggregates shrink in size with increase in the number of headgroups in the surfactants. The aggregation number ($N$) continually decreases and the fractional charge ($\alpha$) increases with more number of headgroups on the surfactants. The semimajor axis ($a$) and semiminor axis ($b = c$) of the micelle also decrease with the increase in the number of headgroups in the surfactants. This indicates that hydrocarbon chains in such micelles prepared from multiheaded surfactants adopt bent conformation and no longer stay in extended conformation.</p>

					<p>Effect of porosity and pore size distribution on the low-frequency dielectric response, in the range {\bf 0.01-100 kHz}, in sintered {\bf ZrO$_{2}$-8 mol$\%$ Y$_{2}$O$_{3}$} ceramic compacts have been investigated. Small-angle neutron scattering {\bf (SANS)} technique has been employed to obtain the pore characteristics like pore size distribution, specific surface area etc. It has been observed that the real and the imaginary parts of the complex dielectric permittivity, for the specimens, depend not only on the porosity but also on the pore size distribution and pore morphology significantly. Unlike normal Debye relaxation process, where the loss tangent vis-à-vis the imaginary part of the dielectric constant shows a pronounced peak, in the present case the same increases at lower frequency region and an anomalous non-Debye type relaxation process manifests.</p>

Even though the complete structure of the polyion complexes could not be ascertained, the results obtained give us the information on the local structure in these polymer-surfactant systems. The data were analysed using the log-normal distribution of the polydispersed spherical aggregate model for the local structure in these complexes.

				<page>0321-0326</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with the small-angle neutron scattering {\bf (SANS)} investigation on solution-quenched {\bf PH13-8} Mo stainless steel. From the nature of the variation of the functionality of the profiles for varying specimen thickness and also from the transmission electron microscopy {\bf (TEM)}, it has been established that the small-angle scattering signal predominantly originates from the block-like metallic carbide precipitates in the specimen. The contribution due to double Bragg reflection is not significant in the present case. The single scattering profile has been extracted from the experimental profiles corresponding to different values of specimen thickness. In order to avoid complexity and non-uniqueness of the multi-parameter minimization for randomly oriented polydisperse block-like precipitate model, the data have been analyzed assuming randomly oriented polydisperse cylindrical particle model with a locked aspect ratio.</p>

				<page>0327-0331</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Precipitates of ceria were synthesized by homogeneous precipitation method using cerium nitrate and hexamethylenetetramine at 80$^{\circ}$C. The precipitates were ground to fine particles of average size $\sim$0.7 $\mu$m. Circular disks with 10 mm diameter, 2 and 3 mm thickness were prepared from the green compacts by sintering at 1300$^{\circ}$C for three different sintering times. Evolution of the pore structures in these specimens with sintering time was investigated by small-angle neutron scattering {\bf (SANS)}. The results show that the peak of the pore size distribution shifts towards the larger size with increasing sintering time although the extent of porosity decreases. This indicates that ¯ner pores are eliminated from the system at a faster rate than the coarser ones as sintering proceeds and some of the finer pores coalesce to form bigger ones.</p>

					<p>We report a combined use of small-angle neutron scattering {\bf (SANS)} and small-angle X-ray scattering {\bf (SAXS)} to the study of counterion condensation in ionic micelles. Small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering measurements have been carried out on two surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide {\bf (CTABr)} and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride {\bf (CTACl)}, which are similar but having different counterions. {\bf SANS} measurements show that {\bf CTABr} surfactant forms much larger micelles than {\bf CTACl}. This is explained in terms of higher condensation of {\bf Br$^{0}$} counterions than {\bf Cl$^{-}$} counterions. {\bf SAXS} data on these systems suggest that the {\bf Br$^{-}$ counterions are condensed around the micelles over smaller thickness than those of {\bf Cl$^{-}$} counterions.</p>

Analysis of small-angle neutron scattering data shows the sample to have a log-normal particle size distribution of median diameter {\bf 64.4 Å} and standard deviation {\bf 0.38}. Magnetization evolves over a long period of time $t$ going nearly linearly with log $t$. Magnetic anisotropy, estimated by fitting $M$-log $t$ curve, shows many fold increase over that of bulk particle sample. Major enhancement owes to disordered moments in surface layer. In the nano-particle state as well increasing amount of {\bf Zn} causes anisotropy to decrease.</p>

				<title>Effect of substitution on aniline in inducing growth of anionic micelles</title>
				<feature>Small-angle neutron scattering</feature>
				<page>0351-0355</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Small-angle neutron scattering {\bf (SANS)} measurements were carried out on sodium dodecyl sulfate {\bf (SDS)} micelles in the presence of three different hydrophobic salts, i.e. aniline hydrochloride, $o$-toluidine hydrochloride and $m$-toluidine hydrochloride. All these salts induce a uniaxial growth of micelles to form prolate ellipsoidal structures. A progressive decrease in the surface charge of the micelles was observed with the addition of salts followed by a rapid growth of the micelles. The presence of a methyl substitution at the ortho position of aniline does not alter the growth behavior significantly. However, when the substitution is at meta position micellar growth is favored at lower salt concentration than that is observed for aniline. This can be explained in terms of the difference in the chemical environments of the substituents at the ortho and meta positions.</p>

					<p>The native form of serum albumin is the most important soluble protein in the body plasma. In order to investigate the structural changes of Bovine serum albumin {\bf (BSA)} during its unfolding in the presence of urea, a small-angle neutron scattering {\bf (SANS)} study was performed. The scattering curves of dilute solutions of {\bf BSA} with different concentrations of urea in {\bf D$_{2}$O at pH 7.2 $\pm$ 0.2} were measured at room temperature. The scattering profile was fitted to a prolate ellipsoidal shape $(a, b, b)$ of the protein with $a = 52.2 Å$  and $b = 24.2 Å$. The change in the dimensions of the protein as it unfolds was found to be anisotropic. The radius of gyration of the compact form of the protein in solution decreased as the urea concentration was increased.</p>

				<page>0375-0379</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We propose an order of magnitude improvement in the present five parts in $10^{5}$ precision of a nondispersive interferometric measurement of the neutron coherent scattering length $b_{c}$ . For this purpose we make a judicious selection of the Bragg angle for the interferometer and the sample thickness. The precision is further improved by an optimal choice of the Bragg reflection (and a consequent neutron wavelength). By performing the experiment in vacuum, errors arising from possible variations in the pressure, composition or humidity of the ambient air can be eliminated. On attaining such precision, we ought to account for the neutron beam refraction at the sample-ambient interfaces, to infer the correct $b_{c}$ from the observed phase. The formula for the phase used hitherto is approximate and would significantly overestimate $b_{c}$ . The refractive index for neutrons can thus be determined to a phenomenal precision of a few parts in $10^{12}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>While studying neutron deflections produced by a magnetic prism, we have stumbled upon a simple `geometric' formula. For a prism of refractive index $n$ close to unity, the deflection simply equals the product of the refractive power $n − 1$ and the base-to-height ratio of the prism, regardless of the apex angle. The base and height of the prism are measured respectively along and perpendicular to the direction of beam propagation within the prism. The geometric formula greatly simplifies the optimisation of prism parameters to suit any specific experiment.</p>

The spectrum up to {\bf 35 meV} represents largely the lattice modes of {\bf Zr} and {\bf Ni} atoms. The vibrational frequencies of hydrogen atoms are expected predominantly at higher energies. The phonon spectra from {\bf 35–180 meV} were recorded using a {\bf Be} filter as analyser. In order to analyse the observed neutron spectra, we assume a set of Einstein modes due to the hydrogen atoms which are delta functions in energy. These delta functions are broadened by the resolution of the instrument. The vibrational frequencies obtained from the fitting of the observed phonon spectra have been assigned to various tetrahedral sites in both the compounds.</p>

The calculated phonon spectrum using the available potential show fair agreement with the experimental data. However, the agreement between the two is improved by including the polarisability of the oxygen atoms in the framework of the shell model. The lattice dynamical models are also exploited for calculations of various thermodynamic properties of {\bf GaPO$_{4}$}.</p>

					<p>{\bf Li$_{2}$O} finds several important technological applications, as it is used in solid-state batteries, can be used as a blanket breeding material in nuclear fusion reactors, etc. {\bf Li$_{2}$O} exhibits a fast ion phase, characterized by a thermally induced dynamic disorder in the anionic sub-lattice of {\bf Li$^{+}$} , at elevated temperatures around {\bf 1200 K}. We have carried out lattice-dynamical calculations of {\bf Li$_{2}$O} using a shell model in the quasi-harmonic approximation. The calculated phonon frequencies are in excellent agreement with the reported inelastic neutron scattering data. Thermal expansion, specific heat, elastic constants and equation of state have also been calculated which are in good agreement with the available experimental data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An extended three-body force shell model {\bf (ETSM)} has been applied to investigate the static and dynamic properties of {\bf KCN$_{x}$Cl$_{1−x}$} for the composition $x = 0.56$ and {\bf 1.0} at {\bf 300 K}. The phonon dispersion curves computed by us are compared with the single crystal neutron diffraction data. The unusual features of these curves are the upward curvature seen in some of the acoustic branches. This is a result of $K$-dependent softening of the phonon due to translation–rotation coupling. The transverse acoustic branch is more soft near the zone centre.</p>

				<feature>Inelastic neutron scattering</feature>
				<page>0431-0435</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phonon spectra for liquid Li and Na have been computed through the phenomenological model of Bhatia and Singh for disordered systems like liquids and glasses and the obtained results have been compared with the available data obtained by inelastic neutron scattering {\bf (INS)} and inelastic X-ray scattering {\bf (IXS)} experiments. The effective pair potentials and their space derivatives are important ingredients in the computation of the dispersion curves. The pair potentials are obtained using the pseudo-potential theory. The empty core model proposed by Ashcroft is widely used for pseudo-potential calculations for alkali metals. But, it is thought to be unsuitable for {\bf Li} because of its simple 1s electronic structure. However, it can be used with an additional term known as Born–Mayer {\bf (BM)} core term. The influence of the BM core term on the phonon dispersion is discussed. The same pseudo-potential formalism has been employed to obtain the dispersion relation in liquid {\bf Li$_{0.61}Na$_{0.39}$} alloy. Apart from the phonon spectra, the Ashcroft–Langreth structure factors in the alloy are derived in the Percus–Yevick approximation.</p>

				<feature>Quasi-elastic neutron scattering</feature>
				<page>0443-0448</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present in this paper a comparative study on the dynamics of benzene, cyclohexane, and methanol molecules, confined in the pores of {\bf MCM-41} molecular sieve and {\bf HZSM-5} zeolite. The quasi-elastic neutron scattering {\bf (QENS)} measurements revealed that the physical state of these adsorbed molecules depended not only on the structural characteristics of the host matrix but also on the chemical properties, such as dipole moment, of the guest molecules. Thus, while no motion was observed in the time-scale of $10^{−10}  –10^{−12}$ s in the case of methanol, the larger size benzene and cyclohexane molecules are found to perform six-fold and three-fold jump rotation, respectively, when adsorbed inside the cages of {\bf HZSM-5} at room temperature. At the same time, all the three molecules are found to undergo a translational motion inside the pores of {\bf MCM-41} molecular sieves, the value of diffusion constant being the lowest in case of methanol because of its higher polarity. Translationl motion of the guest molecules inside the pores of {\bf MCM-41} can be satisfactorily described by Chudley–Eliott fixed jump length diffusion and accordingly the residence time, jump length and diffusion constant are estimated.</p>

					<p>Linear position sensitive detectors {\bf (PSDs)} are widely used to configure neutron diffractometers and other instruments. Necessary front-end electronics and a data acquisition system [1] is developed to cater to such instruments built around the Dhruva research reactor in {\bf BARC}. These include three diffractometers with multiple {\bf PSDs} and four with single {\bf PSD}. The front-end electronics consists of high voltage units, preamplifiers [2], shaping amplifiers, ratio {\bf ADCs (RDC)} [3]. The data acquisition system consists of an interface card and software. Commercially available hardware like temperature controller or stepper motor controller connected over {\bf GPIB} or {\bf RS232} are also integrated in the data acquisition system. The data acquisition is automated so that it can continue unattended for control parameter like temperature, thus enabling optimum utilization of available beam time. The instrumentation is scalable and can be easily configured for various instrumental requirements. The front-end electronics and the data acquisition system are described here.</p>

					<p>A two-dimensional position sensitive neutron detector has been developed.

The pulse height spectrum recorded at an anode potential of 2000 V shows energy resolution of $\sim 25\%$ for the 764 keV peak. A spatial resolution of 8 mm $\times$ 6 mm is achieved.

				<feature>Neutron instrumentation</feature>
				<page>0471-0475</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A gas-filled microstrip detector for thermal neutrons has been built and successfully tested in our laboratory. The detector has an active area of 20 mm $\times$ 15 mm and consists of alternate anodes and cathodes of widths 12 $\mu$m and 300 $\mu$m respectively. The anode to cathode gap is 150 $\mu$m and the pitch is 612 $\mu$m. A high resistance, meandering type horizontal strip connects the anodes at one end and aids in position sensing by charge division method. The detector is tested with gas mixtures {\bf $^{3}$He+Kr (1 : 2)} and $^{3}$He+CF$_{4}$ (2 : 1) at pressure of 3 atmospheres and using a {\bf Pu-Be} neutron source. The pulse height spectrum shows energy resolution of $\sim 8\%$ {\bf (FWHM)} for the 764 keV peak at anode voltage of 525 V for $^{3}$He+Kr and $\sim 15\%$ at anode voltage of 800 V for $^{3}$He+CF$_{4}$. Gas gains up to $6.3 \times 10^{3}$ and $3.6 \times 10^{3}$ are obtained respectively with these gas mixtures. The overall efficiency of the detector along the sensitive length is tested by exposing the active area to neutrons and recording the position spectrum. The detector shows fairly uniform efficiency $(\sim 45\%)$ over the active length.</p>

To get a determinate model, we have assumed the conditions $\sigma \alpha \theta$ and $\zeta \theta$ = constant where $\sigma$ is the shear, $\theta$ the expansion in the model and $\zeta$ the coefficient of bulk viscosity. The behaviour of the model in the presence and absence of magnetic field together with physical and geometrical aspects of the model are also discussed.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0491-0507</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New neutral gauge bosons $Z'$ are the features of many models addressing the physics beyond the standard model. Together with the existence of new neutral gauge bosons, models based on extended gauge groups (rank $&#62; 4$) often predict new charged fermions also. A mixing of the known fermions with new states, with exotic weak-isospin assignments (left-handed singlets and right-handed doublets) will induce tree-level flavour-changing neutral interactions mediated by $Z$ exchange, while if the mixing is only with new states with ordinary weak-isospin assignments, the flavour-changing neutral currents are mainly due to the exchange of the new neutral gauge boson $Z'$. We review flavour-changing neutral currents in models with extra $Z'$ boson. Then we discuss some flavour-changing processes forbidden in the standard model and new contributions to standard model processes.</p>

				<title>Three-body analysis of $^{11}$Li and its $\beta$-decay to deuteron channel and to halo analog state $^{11}$Be$^{*}$ (18.3 MeV)</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0509-0528</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ground state wave function of $^{11}$Li obtained in a three-body model proposed earlier (S Kumar and V S Bhasin, {\textit{Phys. Rev.}} {\bf C65}, 034007 (2002)) has been employed to study the probability distributions, momentum distributions and n–n correlation. Complex scaling method has been used to find the energy positions and widths of the three resonant states of $^{11}$Li above the breakup threshold. The formalism is extended further to study the $\beta$-decay of $^{11}$Li to two channels. One is the $\beta$-transition of $^{11}$Li into a high lying excited state of $^{11}$Be at 18.3 MeV, i.e., $^{11}$Be$^{∗}$ and the second is the decay to deuteron $+$ $^{9}Li channel. The $^{11}$Be$^{∗}$ state has been considered as a halo analog state identified as a bound three-body ($^{9}$Li $+$ n $+$ p) system. The n- $^{9}$Li interaction in-corporates both the virtual state and the p-wave resonance observed experimentally. For p- $^{9}$Li interaction, a Coulomb corrected separable interaction is constructed using charge indepedendence for strong interaction part. The n–p interaction is operative only in $^{3}$S$_{1}$ state corresponding to the isotopic spin $T_{h} = 0$. As a result the $^{11}$Be$^{∗}$ state has the same isotopic spin as that of $^{9}$Li core, i.e., $T = 3/2$. Using these realistic parameters as input and without invoking any other free parameter, the model has been used to predict the strength of the Gamow–Teller $\beta$-decay of $^{11}$Li to $^{11}$Be$^{∗}$ , i.e., $B_{\text{GT}} = 1.5$ and the value of the branching ratio to $^{9}$Li $+$ deuteron channel to be $1.3 \times 10^{−4}$ . These results are found to be in rather good agreement with the recent experimental findings.</p>

					<p>Photon mass attenuation coefficients of some thermoluminescent dosimetric {\bf (TLD)} compounds, such as {\bf LiF, CaCO$_{3}$ , CaSO$_{4}$ , CaSO$_{4}$ ·2H$_{2}$O, SrSO$_{4}$ , CdSO$_{4}$ , BaSO$_{4}$, C$_{4}$H$_{6}$BaO$_{4}$ and 3CdSO$_{4}$ ·8H$_{2}$O} were determined at {\bf 279.2, 320.07, 514.0, 661.6, 1115.5, 1173.2} and {\bf 1332.5 keV} in a well-collimated narrow beam good geometry set-up using a high resolution, hyper pure germanium detector. The attenuation coefficient data were then used to compute the effective atomic number and the electron density of {\bf TLD} compounds. The interpolation of total attenuation cross-sections of photons of energy $E$ in elements of atomic number $Z$ was performed using the logarithmic regression analysis of the data measured by the authors and reported earlier. The best-fit coefficients so obtained in the photon energy range of {\bf 279.2} to {\bf 320.07 keV}, {\bf 514.0} to {\bf 661.6 keV} and {\bf 1115.5} to {\bf 1332.5 keV} by a piece-wise interpolation method were then used to find the effective atomic number and electron density of the compounds. These values are found to be in agreement with other available published values.</p>

					<p>Electron cyclotron resonance {\bf (ECR)} plasma is produced and studied in a small cylindrical system. Microwave power is delivered by a {\bf CW} magnetron at {\bf 2.45 GHz} in {\bf TE$_{10}$} mode and launched radially to have extraordinary {\bf (X)} wave in plasma. The axial magnetic field required for {\bf ECR} in the system is such that the first two {\bf ECR} surfaces ($B = 875.0$ G and $B = 437.5$ G) reside in the system. {\bf ECR} plasma is produced with hydrogen with typical plasma density $n_{e}$ as $3.2 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ and plasma temperature $T_{e}$ between 9 and 15 eV. Various cut-off and resonance positions are identified in the plasma system. {\bf ECR} heating {\bf (ECRH)} of the plasma is observed experimentally. This heating is because of the mode conversion of {\bf X}-wave to electron Bernstein wave {\bf (EBW)} at the upper hybrid resonance {\bf (UHR)} layer. The power mode conversion efficiency is estimated to be 0.85 for this system. The experimental results are presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Higher order contribution to the propagation characteristics of low frequency transverse waves in a dusty plasma</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0579-0593</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Characteristic features of low frequency transverse wave propagating in a magnetised dusty plasma have been analysed considering the effect of dust-charge fluctuation. The distinctive behaviours of both the left circularly polarised and right circularly polarised waves have been exhibited through the analysis of linear and non-linear dispersion relations. The phase velocity, group velocity, and group travel time for the waves have been obtained and their propagation characteristics have been shown graphically with the variations of wave frequency, dust density and amplitude of the wave. The change in non-linear wave number shift and Faraday rotation angle have also been exhibited with respect to the plasma parameters. It is observed that the effects of dust particles are significant only when the higher order contributions are considered. This may be referred to as the `dust regime' in plasma.</p>

				<title>Upconversion of whistler waves by gyrating ion beams in a plasma</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0595-0610</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A gyrating ion beam, with a ring-shaped distribution in velocity, supports negative energy beam modes near the harmonics of beam gyro-frequency. An investigation of the non-linear interaction of high-frequency whistler waves with the negative energy beam cyclotron mode is made. A non-linear dispersion relation is derived for the coupled modes. It is shown that a gyrating ion-beam frequency upconverts the whistler waves separated by harmonics of beam gyro-frequency. The expression for the growth rate of whistler mode waves has been derived. In Case 1, a high-amplitude whistler wave decays into two lower frequency waves, called a low-frequency mode and a side band of frequency lower than that of pump wave. In Case 2 a high-amplitude whistler wave decays into two lower frequency daughter waves, called the low-frequency mode and whistler waves. Generation mechanism of these waves has application in space and laboratory plasmas.</p>

Iodine {\bf (I$_{2}$)} is used as transporting material for this purpose. The energy dispersive analysis by X-ray  {\bf (EDAX)} confirmed the stoichiometry of the as-grown crystals.

				<abstract>
					<p>In general, the conductivity in chalcogenide glasses at higher tempratures is dominated by band conduction (DC conduction). But, at lower tempratures, hoping conduction dominates over band conduction. A study at lower temprature can, eventually, provide useful information about the conduction mechanism and the defect states in the material. Therefore, the study of electrical properties of Ge$_{x}$Se$_{100-x}$ in the lower temperature region (room temperature) is interesting. Temperature and frequency dependence of Ge$_{x}$Se$_{100-x}$ ($x = 15, 20$ and $25$) have been studied over different range of temperatures and frequencies. Am agreement between experimental and theoretical results suggested that the behaviour of germanium selenium system (Ge$_{x}$Se$_{100-x}$) have been successfully explained by correlated barrier hopping {\bf (CBH)} model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Caltech-MIT joint {\bf LIGO} project is operating three long-baseline interferometers (one of 2 km and two of 4 km) in order to unambiguously measure the infinitesimal displacements of isolated test masses which convey the signature of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources. An interferometric gravitational wave detector like {\bf LIGO} is a complex, non-linear, coupled, dynamic system. This article summarizes various interesting design characteristics of these detectors and techniques that were implemented in order to reach and maintain its operating condition. Speci¯cally, the following topics are discussed: (i) length sensing and control, (ii) alignment sensing and control and (iii) thermal lensing which changes the performance and operating point of the interferometer as the input power to {\bf LIGO} is increased.</p>

				<title>Binary compact object inspiral: Detection expectations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0673-0683</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We review the current estimates of binary compact object inspiral rates in particular in view of the recently discovered highly relativistic binary pulsar {\bf J0737-3039}. One of the robust results is that, because of this discovery, the rate estimates for binary neutron stars have increased by a factor of {\bf 6-7} independent of any uncertainties related to the pulsar population properties. This rate increase has dramatic implications for gravitational wave detectors. For initial {\bf LIGO}, the most probable detection rates for double neutron star {\bf (DNS)} inspirals is 1 event/(5{250) yr; at $95\%$ confidence we obtain rates up to 1/1.5 yr. For advanced {\bf LIGO}, the most probable rates are {\bf 20-1000} events/yr. These predictions, for the first time, bring the expectations for {\bf DNS} detections by initial {\bf LIGO} to the astrophysically relevant regime. We also use our models to predict that the large-scale Parkes multibeam pulsar survey with acceleration searches could detect an average of three to four binary pulsars similar to those known at present. In comparison, rate estimates for binaries with black holes are derived based on binary evolution calculation, and based on the optimistic ends of the ranges, remain an important candidate for inspiral detection in the next few years.</p>
					<p>We also consider another aspect of the detectability of binary inspiral: the effect of precession on the detection efficiency of astrophysically relevant binaries. Based on our current astrophysical expectations, large tilt angles are not favored. As a result the decrease in detection rate varies rather slowly with black hole spin magnitude and is within $20-30\%$ of the maximum possible values.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The equations of motion of two point masses in harmonic coordinates are derived through the third post-Newtonian {\bf (3PN)} approximation. The problem of self-field regularization (necessary for removing the divergent self-¯eld of point particles) is dealt with in two separate steps. In the first step the extended Hadamard regularization is applied, resulting in equations of motion which are complete at the {\bf 3PN} order, except for the occurrence of one and only one unknown parameter. In the second step the dimensional regularization (in $d$ dimensions) is used as a powerful argument for fixing the value of this parameter, thereby completing the 3-dimensional Hadamard-regularization result. The complete equations of motion and associated energy at the {\bf 3PN} order are given in the case of circular orbits.</p>

					<p>Astrophysical sources of gravitational waves fall broadly into three categories: (i) transient and bursts, (ii) periodic or continuous wave and (iii) stochastic. Each type of source requires a different type of data analysis strategy. In this talk various data analysis strategies will be reviewed. Optimal filtering is used for extracting binary inspirals; Fourier transforms over Doppler shifted time intervals are computed for long duration periodic sources; optimally weighted cross-correlations for stochastic background. Some recent schemes which efficiently search for inspirals will be described. The performance of some of these techniques on real data obtained will be discussed. Finally, some results on cancellation of systematic noises in laser interferometric space antenna {\bf (LISA)} will be presented and future directions indicated.</p>

					<p>We review the experimental evidence for Einstein's general relativity. Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle support the postulates of curved space-time and bound variations of fundamental constants in space and time, while solar system experiments strongly confirm weak-field general relativity. The binary pulsar provides tests of gravitational wave damping and of strong-field general relativity. Future experiments, such as the gravity probe {\bf B} gyroscope experiment, a satellite test of the equivalence principle, and tests of gravity at short distance to look for extra spatial dimensions could further constrain alternatives to general relativity. Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatories on Earth and in space may provide new tests of scalar–tensor gravity and graviton-mass theories via the properties of gravitational waves.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Gravitational collapse is one of the most striking phenomena in gravitational physics. The cosmic censorship conjecture has provided strong motivation for research in this field. In the absence of a general proof for censorship, many examples have been proposed, in which naked singularity is the outcome of gravitational collapse. Recent developments have revealed that there are examples of naked singularity formation in the collapse of physically reasonable matter fields, although the stability of these examples is still uncertain. We propose the concept of `effective naked singularities', which will be quite helpful because general relativity has limitation in its application at the high-energy end. The appearance of naked singularities is not detestable but can open a window for the new physics of strongly curved space-times.</p>

The quantum theory is free of singularities, and there are new phenomenological scenarios for the evolution of the very early universe such as inflation.

				<abstract>
					<p>There has been substantial progress in brane-world cosmology in recent years. Much attention has been particularly paid to the second Randall–Sundrum {\bf (RS2)} scenario in which a single positive-tension brane is embedded in a five-dimensional space-time, called the bulk, with a negative cosmological constant. This brane-world scenario is quite attractive because of the non-trivial geometry in the bulk and because it successfully gives four-dimensional general relativity in the low energy limit. After reviewing basic features of the {\bf RS2} scenario, we consider a brane-world inflation model driven by the dynamics of a scalar field living in the five-dimensional bulk, the so-called bulk inflaton model. An intriguing feature of this model is that the projection of the bulk inflaton on the brane behaves just like an ordinary inflaton in four dimensions in the low energy regime, $H^{2} l^{2} \ll 1$, where $H$ is the Hubble expansion rate of the brane and $l$ is the curvature radius of the bulk. We then discuss the cosmological perturbation on superhorizon scales in this model. We find that, even under the presence of spatial inhomogeneities, the model is indistinguishable from the standard four-dimensional inflation to $O(H^{2} l^{2})$. That is, the difference may appear only at $O(H^{4} l^{4})$.</p>

Observations of the large scale structure in the distribution of galaxies, high red-shift supernova, have provided the required complementary information.

					<p>We have designed and tested a new relativistic Lagrangian hydrodynamics code, which treats gravity in the conformally flat approximation to general relativity. We have tested the resulting code extensively, finding that it performs well for calculations of equilibrium single-star models, collapsing relativistic dust clouds, and quasi-circular orbits of equilibrium solutions. By adding a radiation reaction treatment, we compute the full evolution of a coalescing binary neutron star system. We find that the amount of mass ejected from the system, much less than a per cent, is greatly reduced by the inclusion of relativistic gravitation. The gravity wave energy spectrum shows a clear divergence away from the Newtonian point-mass form, consistent with the form derived from relativistic quasi-equilibrium fluid sequences.</p>

				<feature>Short Talks</feature>
				<page>0851-0858</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The thermodynamics of general relativistic systems with boundary, obeying a Hamiltonian constraint in the bulk, is determined solely by the boundary quantum dynamics, and hence by the area spectrum. Assuming, for large area of the boundary, (a) an area spectrum as determined by non-perturbative canonical quantum general relativity {\bf (NCQGR)}, (b) an energy spectrum that bears a power law relation to the area spectrum, (c) an area law for the leading order microcanonical entropy, leading thermal fluctuation corrections to the canonical entropy are shown to be logarithmic in area with a universal coefficient. Since the microcanonical entropy also has universal logarithmic corrections to the area law (from quantum space-time fluctuations, as found earlier) the canonical entropy then has a universal form including logarithmic corrections to the area law. This form is shown to be independent of the index appearing in assumption (b). The index, however, is crucial in ascertaining the domain of validity of our approach based on thermal equilibrium.</p>

				<title>Cosmology with cluster surveys</title>
				<feature>Short Talks</feature>
				<page>0871-0875</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surveys of clusters of galaxies provide us with a powerful probe of the density and nature of the dark energy. The red-shift distribution of detected clusters is highly sensitive to the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. Upcoming Sunyaev–Zel'dovich {\bf (SZ)} surveys would provide us large yields of clusters to very high red-shifts. Self-calibration of cluster scaling relations, possible for such a huge sample, would be able to constrain systematic biases on mass estimators. Combining cluster red-shift abundance with limited mass follow-up and cluster mass power spectrum can then give constraints on $w$, as well as on $\sigma_{8}$ and $\Omega_{M}$ to a few per cents.</p>

				<page>0921-0936</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The simplest formulas connecting Jacobi elliptic functions with different modulus parameters were first obtained over two hundred years ago by John Landen. His approach was to change integration variables in elliptic integrals. We show that Landen’s formulas and their subsequent generalizations can also be obtained from a different approach, using which we also obtain several new Landen transformations. Our new method is based on recently obtained periodic solutions of physically interesting non-linear differential equations and remarkable new cyclic identities involving Jacobi elliptic functions.</p>

				<title>An investigation of the influence of the pairing correlations on the properties of the isobar analog resonances in $A = 208$ nuclei</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0947-0961</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Within the quasi-particle random phase approximation {\bf (QRPA)}, the method of the self-consistent determination of the isovector effective interaction which restores a broken isotopic symmetry for the nuclear part of the Hamiltonian is given. The effect of the pairing correlations between nucleons on the following quantities were investigated for the $A = 208$ nuclei: energies of the isobar analog $0^{+}$ states, the isospin admixtures in the ground state of the even–even nuclei, and the differential cross-section for the {\bf $^{208}$Pb($^{3}$He,$t$)$^{208}$Bi} reaction at {\bf $E(^{3}He) = 450$ MeV}. Both couplings of the excitation branches with $T_{z} = T_{0} \pm 1$, and the analog state with isovector monopole resonance {\bf (IVMR)} in the quasi-particle representation were taken into account in our calculations. As a result of these calculations, it was seen that the pairing correlations between nucleons have no considerable effect on the $T = 23$ isospin admixture in the ground state of the {\bf $^{208}$Pb} nucleus, and they cause partially an increase in the isospin impurity of the isobar analog resonance {\bf (IAR)}. It was also established that these correlations have changed the isospin structure of the {\bf IAR} states, and shifted the energies of the {\bf IVMR} states to the higher values.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper describes a simple and cost effective method for the realization of an optical interferometer based on holographic optics, which use minimal bulk optical components. The optical arrangement in the proposed method involves a very simple alignment procedure and inexpensive holographic recording material is used in the formation of holographic optical elements. The proposed interferometer set-up is quite suitable for performing optical test studies on phase (transparent) objects in real-time. Recording schemes for the formation of holographic optical elements and the related technique for the realization of the interferometer set-up along with the experimental results have been presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A non-linear mirror consisting of a lithium triborate crystal and a dichroic output coupler are used to mode-lock (passively) an {\bf Nd : YVO$_{4}$} laser, pumped by a diode laser array. The laser can operate both in cw mode-locked and simultaneously {\bf Q}-switched and mode-locked {\bf (QML)} regime. The peak power of the laser while operating in {\bf QML} regime is much higher but pulses suffers from poor amplitude stability. The incorporation of an acousto-optic modulator as an active {\bf Q}-switch enhances the stability of the {\bf QML} pulse envelope. The second-order non-linearity of powdered crystalline urea is conclusively measured with respect to {\bf KDP} while the laser is operating in passively {\bf Q}-switched and passively mode-locked regime as well as in actively {\bf Q}-switched and passively mode-locked regime.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A self-consistent and general description of obliquely propagating low-frequency electrostatic dust-modes in a non-uniform magnetized dusty plasma system has been presented. A number of different situations, which correspond to different low-frequency electrostatic dust-modes, namely, dust-acoustic mode, dust-drift mode, dust-cyclotron mode, dust-lower-hybrid mode, and other associated modes (such as, accelerated and retarded dust-acoustic modes, accelerated and retarded dust-lower-hybrid modes, etc.), have also been investigated. It has been shown that the effects of obliqueness and inhomogeneities in plasma particle number densities introduce new electrostatic dust modes as well as significantly modify the dispersion properties of the other low-frequency electrostatic dust associated modes. The implications of these results to some space and astrophysical dusty plasma systems, especially to planetary ring-systems and cometary tails, are briefly mentioned.</p>

					<p>Temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of a multi-keV monochromatic point x-ray source based on vacuum diode with laser-produced plasma as cathode are presented. Electrons from a laser-produced aluminium plasma were accelerated towards a conical point tip titanium anode to generate K-shell x-ray radiation. Approximately $10^{10}$ photons/pulse were generated in x-ray pulses of $\sim 18$ to $\sim 28$ ns duration from a source of $\sim 300 \mu$m diameter, at $h\nu = 4.51$ keV ($K_{\alpha}$ emission of titanium), with a brightness of $\sim 10^{20}$ photons/cm$^{2}$ /s/sr. This was sufficient to record single-shot x-ray radiographs of physical objects on a {\bf DEF-5} x-ray film kept at a distance of up to $\sim 10$ cm.</p>

				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>1053-1062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An approximate simple scaling law is obtained for asymmetric $(e, 3e)$ process on helium-like ions for double ionization by fast electrons. It is based on the equation $(Z'^{3} /\pi)$ exp$[−Z' (r_{1} + r_{2})]$, $Z' = Z − (5/16)$ for ground state wave function of helium- like ions and $Z'^{2}$ scaling of energies. The scaling law is found to work very well if the lower energy electron is ejected along the momentum transfer direction and the other one is ejected in the opposite direction. It also works quite well if this electron is ejected within about $90^{\circ}$ of the momentum transfer direction with the other electron going in the opposite direction. The scaling law becomes increasingly accurate as the target nuclear charge and the energy increase.</p>

					<p>Three different types of ionization and excitation processes are studied in detail for the scattering of positronium {\bf (Ps)} by the simplest alkali atom {\bf (Li)} using a Coulomb–Born approximation for ionization and first-Born approximation for excitation. This is the first work where orthogonalized Coulomb wave is used to represent the ionized electron for {\bf Ps–Li} scattering using a single-electron and a three-electron prescription of the target. {\bf Li} is chosen to minimize the effect of intrinsic correlation among the target atomic electrons so that it can extract the basic physics more accurately. All the possible Coulomb interactions are considered exactly. Comparative studies of different cross-sections using two different representations of the target provide us the informations to enrich our ideas about the system and the important role of core electrons.</p>

					<p>In the talk I discuss a few selected topics in Higgs phenomenology at the LHC. After some brief remarks on the standard model Higgs I turn to more novel possiblities, discussing a heavy Higgs scenario, a light Higgs scenario and a no Higgs scenario. In the case of the light HIggs, I discuss briefly the physics opportunities afforded if it becomes possible to detect low angle scattered protons at the LHC</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss applications of the perturbative {\bf QCD} approach in the exclusive non-leptonic two-body $B$-meson decays. We briefly review its ingredients and some important theoretical issues on the factorization approach. {\bf PQCD} results are compatible with present experimental data for charmless $B$-meson decays. We predict the possibility of large direct {\bf CP} asymmetry in $B^{0} \rightarrow \pi^{+} \pi^{−} (23 \pm 7\%)$ and $B^{0} \rightarrow K^{+} \pi^{−} (−17 \pm 5\%)$. We also investigate the branching ratios, {\bf CP} asymmetry and isospin symmetry breaking in radiative $B \rightarrow (K^{∗} /\rho)\gamma$ decays.</p>

				<title>Search for new physics at a super-$B$ factory</title>

				<page>1171-1194</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The importance of a super-$B$ factory in the search for new physics, in particular, due to {\bf CP}-odd phase(s) from physics beyond the standard model is surveyed. The first point to emphasize is that we now know how to directly measure all three angles of the unitarity triangle very cleanly, i.e. without theoretical assumptions with irreducible theory error $\lesssim 1\%$. However, this requires much more luminosity than is currently available at $B$-factories. Direct searches via penguin-dominated hadronic modes as well as radiative, pair-leptonic and semi-leptonic decays are also discussed. Null tests of the {\bf SM} are stressed as these will play a crucial role especially if the effects of {\bf BSM} phase(s) on $B$-physics are small.</p>

					<p>Since the turn of the millennium there has been tremendous progress in understanding {\bf QCD} at finite chemical potential, $\mu$. Apart from qualitative results obtained using models, and exact results at very large $\mu$ obtained in weak coupling theory, there has been tremendous progress in getting exact and quantitative results from lattice simulations. I summarize the status of lattice {\bf QCD} at finite chemical potential – locating the critical end-point in the {\bf QCD} phase diagram, predicting event-to-event fluctuation rates of conserved quantities, and finding the rate of strangeness production.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1269-1282</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The inflationary paradigm provides a robust description of the peculiar initial conditions which are required for the success of the hot Big Bang model of cosmology, as well as of the recent precision measurements of temperature fluctuations within the cosmic microwave background. Furthermore, the success of this description indicates that inflation is likely to be associated with physics at energies considerably higher than the weak scale, for which string theory is arguably our most promising candidate. These observations strongly motivate a detailed search for inflation within string theory, although it has (so far) proven to be a hunt for a fairly elusive quarry. This article summarizes some of the recent efforts along these lines, and draws some speculative conclusions as to what the difficulty in finding inflation might mean.</p>

				<title>What can we learn from high precision measurements of neutrino mixing angles?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1295-1306</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many experiments are being planned to measure the neutrino mixing angles more precisely. In this note, the theoretical significance of a high precision measurement of these parameters is discussed. It is emphasized that they can provide crucial information about different ways to understand the origin of large atmospheric neutrino mixing and move us closer towards determining the neutrino mass matrix. They may also be able to throw light on the question of lepton–quark unification as well as the existence of any leptonic symmetries. For instance if exact $\mu \leftrightarrow \tau$ symmetry in the neutrino mass matrix is assumed to be the reason for maximal $\nu_{\mu} - \nu_{\tau}$ mixing, one gets $\theta_{13} = 0$ and $\theta_{13} \simeq \sqrt{\Delta m^{2}_{\odot} / \Delta m^{2}_{{\text{A}}}$ or $\theta_{13} \simeq \Delta m^{2}_{\odot} / \Delta m^{2}_{{\text{A}}}$ can provide information about the way the $\mu \leftrightarrow \tau$ symmetry breaking manifests in the case of normal hierarchy.</p>

				<title>Particle physics implications of Wilkinson microwave anisotropy project measurements</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1317-1330</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present an overview of the implications of the {\bf WMAP} data for particle physics. The standard parameter set $\varepsilon \eta$ and  $\xi$ characterising the inflaton potential can be related to the power-law indices characterising deviation of the {\bf CMB} spectrum from the scale invariant form. Different classes of inflation potentials are in turn naturally associated with different unified schemes. At present {\bf WMAP} does not exclude any but a few simple unified models. In particular, hybrid models favoured by supersymmetric unification continue to be viable. However future improvement in data leading to better determination of the `running' of power-law indices should help to narrow the possibilities for unified models. The main conclusion is that {\bf WMAP} is consistent with the paradigm of {\bf GUT} scale (10$^{16}$ GeV) inflation.</p>

					<p>The 8th workshop on high energy physics phenomenology {\bf (WHEPP-8)} was held at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India during January 5–16, 2004. One of the four working groups, group {\bf III} was dedicated to {\bf QCD} and heavy ion physics {\bf (HIC)}. The present manuscript gives a summary of the activities of group {\bf III} during the workshop (see also $[1]$ for completeness). The activities of group {\bf III} were focused to understand the collective behaviours of the system formed after the collisions of two nuclei at ultra-relativistic energies from the interactions of the elementary degrees of freedom, i.e. quarks and gluons, governed by non-abelian gauge theory, i.e. {\bf QCD}. This was initiated by two plenary talks on experimental overview of heavy ion collisions and lattice {\bf QCD} and several working group talks and discussions.</p>

					<p>This is the report of neutrino and astroparticle physics working group at {\bf WHEPP-8}. We present the discussions carried out during the workshop on selected topics in the above fields and also indicate progress made subsequently. The neutrino physics subgroup studied the possibilities of constraining neutrino masses, mixing and {\bf CPT} violation in lepton sector from future experiments. Neutrino mass models in the context of Abelian horizontal symmetries, warped extra dimensions and in the presence of triplet Higgs were studied. Effect of threshold corrections on radiative magnification of mixing angles was investigated. The astroparticle physics subgroup focused on how various particle physics inputs affect the {\bf CMBR} fluctuation spectrum, and on brane cosmology. This report also contains an introduction on how to use the publicly available code {\bf CMBFAST} to calculate the {\bf CMBR} fluctuations.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1407-1416</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We argue that neutrino flavor parameters may exhibit features that are very different from those of quarks and charged leptons. Specifically, within the Froggatt–Nielsen {\bf (FN)} framework, charged fermion parameters depend on the ratio between two scales, while for neutrinos a third scale – that of lepton number breaking – is involved. Consequently, the selection rules for neutrinos may be different. In particular, if the scale of lepton number breaking is similar to the scale of horizontal symmetry breaking, neutrinos may become flavor-blind even if they carry different horizontal charges. This provides an attractive mechanism for neutrino flavor anarchy.</p>

				<title>Mean square number fluctuation for a fermion source and its dependence on neutrino mass for the universal cosmic neutrino background</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0017-0029</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the general formulation for obtaining chemical potential $\mu$ of an ideal Fermi gas of particles at temperature $T$, with particle rest mass $m_{0}$ and average density $\langle N \rangle/V$ , the dependence of the mean square number fluctuation $\langle \Delta N^{2} \rangle/V$ on the particle mass $m_{0}$ has been calculated explicitly. The numerical calculations are exact in all cases whether rest mass energy $m_{0}c^{2}$ is very large (non-relativistic case), very small (ultrarelativistic case) or of the same order as the thermal energy $k_{B}T$ . Application of our results to the detection of the universal very low energy cosmic neutrino background {\bf (CNB)}, from any of the three species of neutrinos, shows that it is possible to estimate the neutrino mass of these species if from approximate experimental measurements of their momentum distribution one can extract, someday, not only the density $\langle N_{\nu} \rangle/V$ but also the mean square fluctuation $\langle \Delta N_{\nu}^{2} \rangle/V$. If at the present epoch, the universe is expanding much faster than thermalization rate for {\bf CNB}, it is shown that our analysis leads to a scaled neutrino mass $m_{\nu}$ instead of the actual mass $m_{0\nu}.</p>

To calculate the {\bf EOS} we have used Brueckner–Bethe–Goldstone formalism with Bonn potential as two-body interaction.

					<p>Cluster decay of superdeformed {\bf $^{76,78,80}$Sr} isotopes in their ground state are studied taking the Coulomb and proximity potential as the interacting barrier for the post-scission region. The predicted $T_{1/2}$ values are found to be in close agreement with those values reported by the preformed cluster model {\bf (PCM)}. Our calculation shows that these nuclei are stable against both light and heavy cluster emissions. We studied the decay of these nuclei produced as an excited compound system in heavy-ion reaction. It is found that inclusion of excitation energy increases the decay rate (decreases $T_{1/2}$ value) considerably and these nuclei become unstable against decay. These findings support earlier observation of Gupta {\textit{et al}} based on {\bf PCM}.</p>

				<page>0055-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simple scaling law is obtained for asymmetric $(e, 2e)$ process on helium isoelectronic ions by fast electrons. It is based on treating the targets as having one active electron moving in the effective Coulomb field of the atomic core with an effective charge $Z' = Z − 5/8$. This effective charge is also used in the description of the scattered and ejected electrons. The model has been tested against other available $(e, 2e)$ results on helium in asymmetric geometry. The scaling law is found to work reasonably well for fast incident electrons and becomes increasingly accurate as target $Z$ increases.</p>

				<title>Bifurcation and chaos in simple jerk dynamical systems</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0075-0093</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, it is observed that the third-order explicit autonomous differential equation, named as jerk equation, represents an interesting sub-class of dynamical systems that can exhibit many major features of the regular and chaotic motion. In this paper, we investigate the global dynamics of a special family of jerk systems $\ddddot{x} = -Aẍ - ẋ + G(x)$, where $G(x)$ is a non-linear function, which are known to exhibit chaotic behaviour at some parameter values. We particularly identify the regions of parameter space with different asymptotic dynamics using some analytical methods as well as extensive Lyapunov spectra calculation in complete parameter space. We also investigate the effect of weakening as well as strengthening of the non-linearity in the $G(x)$ function on the global dynamics of these jerk dynamical systems. As a result, we reach to an important conclusion for these jerk dynamical systems that a certain amount of non-linearity is sufficient for exhibiting chaotic behaviour but increasing the non-linearity does not lead to larger regions of parameter space exhibiting chaos.</p>

				<title>Investigation of multipactor breakdown in communication satellite microwave co-axial systems</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0095-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Multipactor breakdown or multipactor discharge is a form of high frequency discharge that may occur in microwave components operating at very low pressures. Some {\bf RF} components of multi-channel communication satellites have co-axial geometry and handle high {\bf RF} power under near-vacuum conditions. The breakdown occurs due to secondary electron resonance, wherein electrons move back and forth in synchronism with the {\bf RF} voltage across the gap between the inner and outer conductors of the co-axial structure. If the yield of secondary electrons from the walls of the co-axial structure is greater than unity, then the electron density increases with time and eventually leads to the breakdown. In this paper, the current due to the oscillating electrons in the co-axial geometry has been treated as a radially oriented Hertzian dipole. The electric field, due to this dipole, at any point in the coaxial structure, may then be determined by employing the dyadic Green’s function technique. This field has been compared with the field that would exist in the absence of multipactor.</p>

				<title>Relaxation of femtosecond photoexcited electrons in a polar indirect band-gap semiconductor nanoparticle</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0111-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A model calculation is given for the energy relaxation of a non-equilibrium distribution of hot electrons (holes) prepared in the conduction (valence) band of a polar indirect band-gap semiconductor, which has been subjected to homogeneous photoexcitation by a femtosecond laser pulse. The model assumes that the pulsed photoexcitation creates two distinct but spatially interpenetrating electron and hole non-equilibrium subsystems that initially relax non-radiatively through the electron (hole)–phonon processes towards the conduction (valence) band minimum (maximum), and finally radiatively through the phonon-assisted electron–hole recombination across the band-gap, which is a relatively slow process. This leads to an accumulation of electrons (holes) at the conduction (valence) band minimum (maximum). The resulting peaking of the carrier density and the entire evolution of the hot electron (hole) distribution has been calculated. The latter may be time resolved by a pump-probe study. The model is particularly applicable to a divided (nanometric) polar indirect band-gap semiconductor with a low carrier concentration and strong electron–phonon coupling, where the usual two-temperature model $[1–4]$ may not be appropriate.</p>

					<p>Raman scattering experiments have been carried out on single crystals of {\bf $Nd_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$MnO$_{3}$} as a function of temperature in the range of {\bf 320–50 K}, covering the paramagnetic insulator–ferromagnetic metal transition at {\bf 250 K} and the charge-ordering antiferromagnetic transition at {\bf 150 K}. The diffusive electronic Raman scattering response is seen in the paramagnetic phase which continue to exist even in the ferromagnetic phase, eventually disappearing below {\bf 150 K}. We understand the existence of diffusive response in the ferromagnetic phase to the coexistence of the different electronic phases. The frequency and linewidth of the phonons across the transitions show significant changes, which cannot be accounted for only by anharmonic interactions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Recently proposed model potential which combines both linear and quadratic types of interactions is employed for the investigation of some properties like the total energy, equation of state and bulk modulus of {\bf AlP, AlAs} and {\bf AlSb} semiconductor compounds using higher-order perturbation theory. The model potential parameter is determined using zero pressure condition. The ratio of the covalent bonding term E cov to the second-order term $E_{2}$ is $6.77\%$ to $11.85\%$ which shows that contribution from higher order terms are important for zinc-blende-type crystals. The calculated numerical results of the total energy, energy band gap at Jones-zone face and bulk modulus of these compounds are in good agreement with the experimental data and found much better than other such theoretical findings. We have also studied pressure–volume relations of these compounds. The present study is carried out using six different screening functions along with latest screening function proposed by Sarkar {\textit{et al}}. It is found from the present study that effect of exchange and correlation is clearly distinguishable.</p>

				<title>The Pondicherry interpretation of quantum mechanics: An overview</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0171-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An overview of the Pondicherry interpretation of quantum mechanics is presented. This interpretation proceeds from the recognition that the fundamental theoretical framework of physics is a probability algorithm, which serves to describe an objective fuzziness (the literal meaning of Heisenberg's term `Unschärfe', usually mistranslated as `uncertainty') by assigning objective probabilities to the possible outcomes of unperformed measurements. Although it rejects attempts to construe quantum states as evolving onto-logical states, it arrives at an objective description of the quantum world that owes nothing to observers or the goings-on in physics laboratories. In fact, unless such attempts are rejected, quantum theory's true ontological implications cannot be seen. Among these are the radically relational nature of space, the numerical identity of the corresponding relata, the incomplete spatio-temporal differentiation of the physical world, and the consequent top-down structure of reality, which defies attempts to model it from the bottom up, whether on the basis of an intrinsically differentiated space-time manifold or out of a multitude of individual building blocks.</p>

					<p>Investigation has been made for unusually low-amplitude anisotropic wave train events {\bf (LAE)} for cosmic ray intensity data of Deep River neutron monitoring station during the period 1981-94. It has been observed that the phase of diurnal anisotropy remains in the same co-rotational direction for most of the {\bf LAE}s while the phase shifts to early hours for some of the {\bf LAE}s in diurnal anisotropy. During minimum solar activity, {\bf LAE}s have been observed to be dominant. Solar wind plasma {\bf (SWP)} parameters, interplanetary magnetic field and various features at solar disk have also been studied. The amplitude remains low continuously for most of the days while the phase shifts to earlier hours. Occurrence of {\bf LAE} is independent of the nature of interplanetary magnetic field {\bf (IMF)}.</p>

The isomeric cross-section ratios were resolved into that for complete and incomplete fusion reactions. The angular momentum of the intermediate nucleus formed in incomplete fusion was deduced from the isomeric cross-section ratio by considering the statistical de-excitation of the incompletely fused composite nucleus. The data show that incomplete fusion is associated with angular momenta slightly smaller than critical angular momentum for complete fusion, indicating the deeper interpenetration of projectile and target nuclei than that in peripheral collisions.</p>

					<p>The earlier theoretical models for spatial inhomogeneities have some errors regarding the structure of the resultant signal originated from backward and forward propagating parts. The application of the method of inhomogeneous basic modes {\bf (MIBM)} and the complete full-wave solution of arbitrarily shaped non-monochromatic plane waves in plasmas made it possible to obtain a better description of the problem, on a fully analytical way, directly from Maxwell's equations. The model investigated in this paper is inhomogeneous of arbitrary order (while the wave pattern can exist), anisotropic (magnetized), linear, cold plasma, in which the gradient of the one-dimensional spatial inhomogeneity is parallel to the direction of propagation.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0269-0278</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The structures and autocorrelation functions of Al and Mg in the liquid state are investigated through the pair distribution function $g(r)$, the diffusion coefficients as well as the shear viscosity via the Green{Kubo and Einstein relations. From the structure and the Enskog relation we determined the frequency of collisions of atoms in the first shell of $g(r)$ in the systems. We also discovered that the packing fraction of Lennard-Jones liquids should be approximately half the reduced density value. This approximation is accurate to within $99\%$. The temperature dependence of the pair distribution function and the atomic mean square displacement are investigated by performing simulations at various experimental temperatures and corresponding densities. The structures of the systems are a®ected by temperature via movements of atoms in the first minimum of $g(r)$.</p> 
					<p>The Lennard-Jones model shows that density dependence of the shear viscosity is in agreement with what is expected of simple liquids in the range of investigated temperatures and densities. In the gas limit, the Stoke-Einstein relation $D_{\eta} = K_{B}T/2\pi\sigma$ is grossly overestimated by Lennard-Jones model. This could not be attributed to defficiencies in the model, as other investigators using first principle method could not obtain the gas limit of the Stoke-Einstein relation.</p>

				<page>0281-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fe$_{72-x}$Al$_{28}$Cr$_{x}$ alloys $(x = 0; 2; 4; 6)$ are made by arc melting a mixture of constituent elements in stoichiometric proportion, in argon atmosphere. The ingots so obtained are filed to make powder samples thereby giving them substantial mechanical deformation. It is observed that as-powdered samples show hyperfine field distribution typical of $\alpha$-phase, where the atoms are randomly distributed on the available sites. Annealing at $900^{\circ}$C for 60 h leads to preferential occupation of lattice sites by the atoms and this results in better defined groups of hyperfine magnetic field {\bf (HMF)} which can be associated with specific configuration in the neighbourhood of probe iron atoms. The average {\bf HMF} is found to decrease sharply with increasing {\bf Cr} concentration even though the net chromium concentration remains low $(\leq 6 {\text{at}} \%)$. The results show that cold working on samples is very important in changing the atomic ordering and must be taken into account if properties of equilibrium phases are probed.</p>

				<title>Liesegang patterns: Complex formation of precipitate in an electric field</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Formation of {\bf 1D} Liesegang patterns was studied numerically in precipitation and reversible complex formation of precipitate scenarios in an electric field. The Ostwald’s supersaturation model reported by Büki, Kárpáti-Smidróczki and Zrínyi ({\bf BKZ} model) was extended further. In the presence of an electric field the position of the first and the last bands ($X_{n}$) measured from the junction point of the outer and the inner electrolytes can be described by the function $X_{n} = a_{1} \tau_{n}^{1/2} + a_{2} \tau_{n} + a_{3}$ , where $\tau_{n}$ is the time elapsed until the nth band formation, $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$ and $a_{3}$ are constants. The variation of the total number of bands with different electric field strengths ($\epsilon$) has a maximum. For higher $\epsilon$ one can observe a moving precipitation zone that becomes wider due to precipitation and reversible complex formation.</p>

				<title>Lattice vibrational properties of transition metal carbides (TiC, ZrC and HfC)</title>
				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0299-0304</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lattice vibrational properties of transition metal carbides ({\bf TiC, ZrC} and {\bf HfC}) have been presented by including the effects of free-carrier doping and three-body interactions in the rigid shell model. The short-range overlap repulsion is operative up to the second neighbour ions. An excellent agreement has been obtained between theory and experiment for their phonon dispersion curves and Debye temperature variations. It is concluded that the contributions of free-carrier doping and three-body interactions are essential for the description of the lattice dynamics of these carbides.</p>

				<title>Logarithmic scaling in the near-dissipation range of turbulence</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0315-0321</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A logarithmic scaling for structure functions, in the form $S_{p} \sim [{\text{ln}} (r/\eta)]^{\zeta_{p}}$ , where $\eta$ is the Kolmogorov dissipation scale and $\zeta_{p}$ are the scaling exponents, is suggested for the statistical description of the near-dissipation range for which classical power-law scaling does not apply. From experimental data at moderate Reynolds numbers, it is shown that the logarithmic scaling, deduced from general considerations for the near-dissipation range, covers almost the entire range of scales (about two decades) of structure functions, for both velocity and passive scalar fields. This new scaling requires two empirical constants, just as the classical scaling does, and can be considered the basis for extended self-similarity.</p>

				<page>0333-0341</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well-known that incompressible turbulence is non-local in real space because sound speed is infinite in incompressible fluids. The equation in Fourier space indicates that it is non-local in Fourier space as well. However, the shell-to-shell energy transfer is local. Contrast this with Burgers equation which is local in real space. Note that the sound speed in Burgers equation is zero. In our presentation we will contrast these two equations using non-local field theory. Energy spectrum and renormalized parameters will be discussed.</p>

				<title>On the dynamical mechanism of cross-over from chaotic to turbulent states</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0343-0352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Portevin–{\bf Le} Chatelier effect is one of the few examples of organization of defects. Here the spatio-temporal dynamics emerges from the cooperative behavior of the constituent defects, namely dislocations and point defects. Recent dynamical approach to the study of experimental time series reports an intriguing cross-over phenomenon from a low dimensional chaotic to an infinite dimensional scale invariant power-law regime of stress drops in experiments on {\bf CuAl} single crystals and {\bf AlMg} polycrystals, as a function of strain rate. We show that an extension of a dynamical model due to Ananthakrishna and coworkers for the Portevin–{\bf Le} Chatelier effect reproduces this cross-over. At low and medium strain rates, the model shows chaos with the structure of the attractor resembling the reconstructed experimental attractor. At high strain rates, the model exhibits a power-law statistics for the magnitudes and durations of the stress drops as in experiments. Concomitantly, the largest Lyapunov exponent is zero. In this regime, there is a finite density of null exponents which itself follows a power law. This feature is similar to the Lyapunov spectrum of a shell model for turbulence. The marginal nature of this state is visualized through slow manifold approach.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sensitivity to initial conditions in nonlinear dynamical systems leads to exponential divergence of trajectories that are initially arbitrarily close, and hence to unpredictability. Statistical methods have been found to be helpful in extracting useful information about such systems. In this paper, we review briefly some statistical methods employed in the study of deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems. These include power spectral analysis and aliasing, extreme value statistics and order statistics, recurrence time statistics, the characterization of intermittency in the Sinai disorder problem, random walk analysis of diffusion in the chaotic pendulum, and long-range correlations in stochastic sequences of symbols.</p>

Our method takes snapshots of the system in terms of its instantaneous frequencies defined as ridges of the time–frequency landscape. Using the wavelet transform of a single trajectory, it can characterize key dynamical properties like the extent of chaos, resonance transitions and trappings.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Forecasting, for obvious reasons, often become the most important goal to be achieved. For spatially extended systems (e.g. atmospheric system) where the local nonlinearities lead to the most unpredictable chaotic evolution, it is highly desirable to have a simple diagnostic tool to identify regions of predictable behaviour. In this paper, we discuss the use of the bred vector {\bf (BV)} dimension, a recently introduced statistics, to identify the regimes where a finite time forecast is feasible. Using the tools from dynamical systems theory and Bayesian modelling, we show the finite time predictability in two-dimensional coupled map lattices in the regions of low {\bf BV} dimension.</p>

				<title>Fractal differential equations and fractal-time dynamical systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0389-0409</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Differential equations and maps are the most frequently studied examples of dynamical systems and may be considered as continuous and discrete time-evolution processes respectively. The processes in which time evolution takes place on Cantor- like fractal subsets of the real line may be termed as fractal-time dynamical systems. Formulation of these systems requires an appropriate framework. A new calculus called $F^{\alpha}$ -calculus, is a natural calculus on subsets $F \subset {\bf R}$ of dimension $\alpha, 0 &#60; \alpha \leq 1.$ It involves integral and derivative of order $\alpha$, called $F^{\alpha} -integral and $F^{\alpha} -derivative respectively. The $F^{\alpha} -integral is suitable for integrating functions with fractal support of dimension $\alpha$, while the $F^{\alpha} -derivative enables us to differentiate functions like the Cantor staircase. The functions like the Cantor staircase function occur naturally as solutions of $F^{\alpha} -differential equations. Hence the latter can be used to model fractal-time processes or sublinear dynamical systems.</p>
					<p>We discuss construction and solutions of some fractal differential equations of the form</p>
					<p>$$D^{\alpha}_{F,t} x = h(x, t),$$</p>
					<p>where $h$ is a vector field and $D^{\alpha}_{F,t}$ is a fractal differential operator of order $\alpha$ in time $t$. We also consider some equations of the form</p>
					<p>$$D^{\alpha}_{F,t} W(x, t) = L[W(x, t)],$$</p>
					<p>where $L$ is an ordinary differential operator in the real variable $x$, and $(t, x) \epsilon F \times {\bf R}^{n}$ where $F$ is a Cantor-like set of dimension $\alpha$.</p>
					<p>Further, we discuss a method of finding solutions to $F^{\alpha}$ -differential equations: They can be mapped to ordinary differential equations, and the solutions of the latter can be transformed back to get those of the former. This is illustrated with a couple of examples.</p>

					<p>Motivated by studies on $q$-deformed physical systems related to quantum group structures, and by the elements of Tsallis statistical mechanics, the concept of $q$-deformed nonlinear maps is introduced. As a specific example, a $q$-deformation procedure is applied to the logistic map. Compared to the canonical logistic map, the resulting family of $q$-logistic maps is shown to have a wider spectrum of interesting behaviours, including the co-existence of attractors – a phenomenon rare in one-dimensional maps.</p>

				<title>The quasi-equilibrium phase of nonlinear chains</title>

				<page>0423-0431</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We show that time evolution initiated via kinetic energy perturbations in conservative, discrete, spring-mass chains with purely nonlinear, non-integrable, algebraic potentials of the form $V (x_{i} − x_{i+1}) \sim (x_{i} − x_{i+1})^{2n}$, $n \geq 2$ and an integer, occurs via discrete solitary waves {\bf (DSWs)} and discrete antisolitary waves {\bf (DASWs)}. Presence of reflecting and periodic boundaries in the system leads to collisions between the {\bf DSWs} and {\bf DASWs}. Such collisions lead to the breakage and subsequent reformation of (different) {\bf DSWs} and {\bf DASWs}. Our calculations show that the system eventually reaches a stable `quasi-equilibrium' phase that appears to be independent of initial conditions, possesses Gaussian velocity distribution, and has a higher mean kinetic energy and larger range of kinetic energy fluctuations as compared to the pure harmonic system with $n = 1$; the latter indicates possible violation of equipartition.</p>

For a selected asymmetry, when a system parameter is controlled, we observed transition from large amplitude limit cycle to homoclinic chaos via a sequence of periodic mixed-mode oscillations interspersed by chaotic states.

				<title>Collective dynamics of delay-coupled limit cycle oscillators</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0465-0482</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coupled limit cycle oscillators with instantaneous mutual coupling offer a useful but idealized mathematical paradigm for the study of collective behavior in a wide variety of biological, physical and chemical systems. In most real-life systems however the interaction is not instantaneous but is delayed due to finite propagation times of signals, reaction times of chemicals, individual neuron firing periods in neural networks etc. We present a brief overview of the effect of time-delayed coupling on the collective dynamics of such coupled systems. Simple model equations describing two oscillators with a discrete time-delayed coupling as well as those describing linear arrays of a large number of oscillators with time-delayed global or local couplings are studied. Analytic and numerical results pertaining to time delay induced changes in the onset and stability of amplitude death and phase-locked states are discussed. A number of recent experimental and theoretical studies reveal interesting new directions of research in this field and suggest exciting future areas of exploration and applications.</p>

				<title>Complex networks: Dynamics and security</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0483-0502</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a perspective in the study of complex networks by focusing on how dynamics may affect network security under attacks. In particular, we review two related problems: attack-induced cascading breakdown and range-based attacks on links. A cascade in a network means the failure of a substantial fraction of the entire network in a cascading manner, which can be induced by the failure of or attacks on only a few nodes. These have been reported for the internet and for the power grid (e.g., the August 10, 1996 failure of the western United States power grid). We study a mechanism for cascades in complex networks by constructing a model incorporating the flows of information and physical quantities in the network. Using this model we can also show that the cascading phenomenon can be understood as a phase transition in terms of the key parameter characterizing the node capacity. For a parameter value below the phase-transition point, cascading failures can cause the network to disintegrate almost entirely. We will show how to obtain a theoretical estimate for the phase-transition point. The second problem is motivated by the fact that most existing works on the security of complex networks consider attacks on nodes rather than on links. We address attacks on links. Our investigation leads to the finding that many scale-free networks are more sensitive to attacks on short-range than on long-range links. Considering that the small-world phenomenon in complex networks has been identified as being due to the presence of long-range links, i.e., links connecting nodes that would otherwise be separated by a long node-to-node distance, our result, besides its importance concerning network efficiency and security, has the striking implication that the small-world property of scale-free networks is mainly due to short-range links.</p>

				<title>Dynamical hysteresis and spatial synchronization in coupled non-identical chaotic oscillators</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0513-0523</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We identify a novel phenomenon in distinct (namely non-identical) coupled chaotic systems, which we term dynamical hysteresis. This behavior, which appears to be universal, is defined in terms of the system dynamics (quantified for example through the Lyapunov exponents), and arises from the presence of at least two coexisting stable attractors over a finite range of coupling, with a change of stability outside this range. Further characterization via mutual synchronization indices reveals that one attractor corresponds to spatially synchronized oscillators, while the other corresponds to desynchronized oscillators. Dynamical hysteresis may thus help to understand critical aspects of the dynamical behavior of complex biological systems, e.g. seizures in the epileptic brain can be viewed as transitions between different dynamical phases caused by time dependence in the brain's internal coupling.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Animal locomotion employs different periodic patterns known as animal gaits. In 1993, Collins and Stewart recognized that gaits possessed certain symmetries and characterized the gaits of quadrupeds and bipeds using permutation symmetry groups, which impose constraints on the locomotion center called the central pattern generator {\bf (CPG)} in the animal brain. They modeled the {\bf CPG} by coupling four nonlinear oscillators and found that it was possible to reproduce all symmetries of the gaits by changing the coupling strength. Here we propose to extend this idea using coupled chaotic oscillators synchronized using the Pyragas method in order to characterize the {\bf CPG} symmetries. We also evaluate the time series behavior when the foot is in contact with the ground: this has potential robotic applications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Simple models show that in Type-I intermittency a characteristic U-shaped probability distribution is obtained for the laminar phase length. The laminar phase length distribution characteristic for Type-I intermittency may be obtained in human heart rate variability data for some cases of pathology. The heart and its regulatory systems are presumed to be both noisy and non-stationary. Although the effect of additive noise on the laminar phase distribution in Type-I intermittency is well-known, the effect of neither multiplicative noise nor non-stationarity have been studied. We first discuss the properties of two classes of models of Type-I intermittency: (a) the control parameter of the logistic map is changed dichotomously from a value within the intermittency range to just below the bifurcation point and back; (b) the control parameter is changed randomly within the same parameter range as in the model class (a). We show that the properties of both models are different from those obtained for Type-I intermittency in the presence of additive noise. The two models help to explain some of the features seen in the intermittency in human heart rate variability.</p>

					<p>Formation of feedback loops of excitation waves (reentrant circuit) around non-conducting ventricular scar tissue is a common cause of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, often leading to death. This is typically treated by rapid stimulation from an implantable device {\bf (ICD)}. However, the mechanisms of reentry termination success and, more importantly, failure, are poorly understood. To study such mechanisms, we simulated pacing termination of reentry in a model of cardiac tissue having significant restitution and dispersion properties. Our results show that rapid pacing dynamically generates conduction inhomogeneities in the reentrant circuit, leading to successful pacing termination of tachycardia. The study suggests that more effective pacing algorithms can be designed by taking into account the role of such dynamical inhomogeneities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum chaos is a subject whose major goal is to identify and to investigate different quantum signatures of classical chaos. Here we study entanglement production in coupled chaotic systems as a possible quantum indicator of classical chaos. We use coupled kicked tops as a model for our extensive numerical studies. We find that, in general, chaos in the system produces more entanglement. However, coupling strength between two subsystems is also a very important parameter for entanglement production. Here we show how chaos can lead to large entanglement which is universal and describable by random matrix theory {\bf (RMT)}. We also explain entanglement production in coupled strongly chaotic systems by deriving a formula based on {\bf RMT}. This formula is valid for arbitrary coupling strengths, as well as for sufficiently long time. Here we investigate also the effect of chaos on the entanglement production for the mixed initial state. We find that many properties of the mixed-state entanglement production are qualitatively similar to the pure state entanglement production. We however still lack an analytical understanding of the mixed-state entanglement production in chaotic systems. </p>

				<title>Stochasticity, decoherence and an arrow of time from the discretization of time? </title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0593-0606</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Certain intriguing consequences of the discreteness of time on the time evolution of dynamical systems are discussed. In the discrete-time classical mechanics proposed here, there is an arrow of time that follows from the fact that the replacement of the time derivative by the backward difference operator alone can preserve the non-negativity of the phase space density. It is seen that, even for free particles, all the degrees of freedom are correlated in principle. The forward evolution of functions of phase space variables by a finite number of time steps, in this discrete-time mechanics, depends on the entire continuous-time history in the interval $[0, \infty]$. In this sense, discrete time evolution is non-local in time from a continuous-time point of view. A corresponding quantum mechanical treatment is possible via the density matrix approach. The interference between non-degenerate quantum mechanical states decays exponentially. This decoherence is present, in principle, for all systems; however, it is of practical importance only in macroscopic systems, or in processes involving large energy changes. </p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The study of nonlinear dynamics has been an active area of research since 1960s, after certain path-breaking discoveries, leading to the concepts of solitons, integrability, bifurcations, chaos and spatio-temporal patterns, to name a few. Several new techniques and methods have been developed to understand nonlinear systems at different levels. Along with these, a multitude of potential applications of nonlinear dynamics have also been enunciated. In spite of these developments, several challenges, some of them fundamental and others on the efficacy of these methods in developing cutting edge technologies, remain to be tackled. In this article, a brief personal perspective of these issues is presented. </p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The struggle of Boltzmann with the proper description of the behavior of classical macroscopic bodies in equilibrium in terms of the properties of the particles out of which they consist will be sketched. He used both a dynamical and a statistical method. However, Einstein strongly disagreed with Boltzmann's statistical method, arguing that a statistical description of a system should be based on the dynamics of the system. This opened the way, especially for complex systems, for other than Boltzmann statistics. The first non-Boltzmann statistics, not based on dynamics though, was proposed by Tsallis. A generalization of Tsallis' statistics as a special case of a new class of superstatistics, based on Einstein's criticism of Boltzmann, is discussed. It seems that perhaps a combination of dynamics and statistics is necessary to describe systems with complicated dynamics.</p>

				<page>0645-0660</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One challenge of biology, medicine, and economics is that the systems treated by these sciences have no perfect metronome in time and no perfect spatial architecture – crystalline or otherwise. Nonetheless, as if by magic, out of nothing but randomness one finds remarkably fine-tuned processes in time and remarkably fine-tuned structures in space. To understand this `miracle', one might consider placing aside the human tendency to see the universe as a machine. Instead, one might address the challenge of uncovering how, through randomness (albeit, as we shall see, strongly correlated randomness), one can arrive at many spatial and temporal patterns in biology, medicine, and economics. Inspired by principles developed by statistical physics over the past 50 years – scale invariance and universality – we review some recent applications of correlated randomness to fields that might startle Boltzmann if he were alive today.</p>

				<title>Sheared solid materials</title>
				<feature>Plenary Talks</feature>
				<page>0661-0677</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau model of nonlinear elasticity in solid materials. We assume that the elastic energy density is a periodic function of the shear and tetragonal strains owing to the underlying lattice structure. With this new ingredient, solving the equations yields formation of dislocation dipoles or slips. In plastic flow high-density dislocations emerge at large strains to accumulate and grow into shear bands where the strains are localized. In addition to the elastic displacement, we also introduce the local free volume $m$. For very small $m$ the defect structures are metastable and long-lived where the dislocations are pinned by the Peierls potential barrier. However, if the shear modulus decreases with increasing $m$, accumulation of $m$ around dislocation cores eventually breaks the Peierls potential leading to slow relaxations in the stress and the free energy (aging). As another application of our scheme, we also study dislocation formation in two-phase alloys (coherency loss) under shear strains, where dislocations glide preferentially in the softer regions and are trapped at the interfaces.</p>

					<p>For systems in contact with two reservoirs at different densities or with two thermostats at different temperatures, the large deviation function of the density gives a possible way of extending the notion of free energy to non-equilibrium systems. This large deviation function of the density can be calculated explicitly for exclusion models in one dimension with open boundary conditions. For these models, one can also obtain the distribution of the current of particles flowing through the system and the results lead to a simple conjecture for the large deviation function of the current of more general diffusive systems.</p>

					<p>Fluids adsorbed at micro-patterned and geometrically structured substrates can exhibit novel phase transitions and interfacial fluctuation effects distinct from those characteristic of wetting at planar, homogeneous walls. We review recent theoretical progress in this area paying particular attention to filling transitions pertinent to fluid adsorption near wedges, which have highlighted a deep connection between geometrical and contact angles. We show that filling transitions are not only characterized by large scale interfacial fluctuations leading to universal critical singularities but also reveal hidden symmetries with short-ranged critical wetting transitions and properties of dimensional reduction. We propose a non-local interfacial model which fulfills all these properties and throws light on long-standing problems regarding the order of the {\bf 3D} short-range critical wetting transition.</p>

				<feature>Plenary Talks</feature>
				<page>0757-0773</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has been observed long ago that many systems from statistical physics behave randomly on macroscopic level at their critical temperature. In two dimensions, these phenomena have been classified by theoretical physicists thanks to conformal field theory, that led to the derivation of the exact value of various critical exponents that describe their behavior near the critical temperature. In the last couple of years, combining ideas of complex analysis and probability theory, mathematicians have constructed and studied a family of random fractals (called `Schramm–Loewner evolutions' or {\bf SLE}) that describe the only possible conformally invariant limits of the interfaces for these models. This gives a concrete construction of these random systems, puts various predictions on a rigorous footing, and leads to further understanding of their behavior. The goal of this paper is to survey some of these recent mathematical developments, and to describe a couple of basic underlying ideas. We will also briefly describe some very recent and ongoing developments relating {\bf SLE}, Brownian loop soups and conformal field theory.</p>

				<title>Classical charged fluids at equilibrium near an interface: Exact analytical density profiles and surface tension</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks:- Topic 1. Rigorous results and exact solutions; general aspects of statistical physics; thermodynamics</feature>
				<page>0785-0801</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The structure of equilibrium density profiles in an electrolyte in the vicinity of an interface with an insulating or conductive medium is of crucial importance in chemical physics and colloidal science. The Coulomb interaction is responsible for screening effects, and in dilute solutions the latter effects give rise to universal leading corrections to nonideality, which distinguish electrolyte from nonelectrolyte solutions. An example is provided by the excess surface tension for an air–water interface, which is determined by the excess particle density, and which was first calculated by Onsager and Samaras. Because of the discrepancy between the dielectric constants on both sides of the interface, every charge in the electrolyte interacts with an electrostatic image, and the Boltzmann factor associated with the corresponding self-energy has an essential singularity over the length scale $l$ from the wall. Besides Coulomb interactions, short-range repulsions must be taken into account in order to prevent the collapse between charges with opposite signs or between each charge and its image when the solvent dielectric constant is lower than that of the continuous medium on the other side of the interface. For a dilute and weakly-coupled electrolyte, $l$ is negligible with respect to the bulk Debye screening length $\xi_{D}$. In the framework of the grand-canonical ensemble, systematic partial resummations in Mayer diagrammatics allow one to exhibit that, in this regime, the exact density profiles at leading order are the same as if they were calculated in a partially-linearized mean-field theory, where the screened pair interaction obeys an inhomogeneous Debye equation. In the latter equation the effective screening length depends on the distance x from the interface: it varies very fast over the length $l$ and tends to its bulk value over a few $\xi_{D}s$. The equation can be solved iteratively at any distance $x$, and the exact density profiles are calculated analytically up to first order in the coupling parameter $l/\xi_{D}$ . They show the interplay between three effects: (1) the geometric repulsion from the interface associated with the deformation of screening clouds, (2) the polarization effects described by the images on the other side of the interface, (3) the interaction between each charge and the potential drop created by the electric layer which appears as soon as the fluid has not a charge-symmetric composition. Moreover, the expressions allow us to go beyond Onsager–Samaras theory: the surface tension is calculated for charge-asymmetric electrolytes and for any value of the ratio between the dielectric constants on both sides of the interface. Similar diagrammatic techniques also allow one to investigate the charge renormalization in the dipolar effective pair interaction along the interface with an insulating medium.</p>

				<feature>Invited Talks:- Topic 2. Phase transitions and critical phenomena (equilibrium and nonequilibrium)</feature>
				<page>0803-0816</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lifshitz points are multicritical points at which a disordered phase, a homogeneous ordered phase, and a modulated ordered phase meet. Their bulk universality classes are described by natural generalizations of the standard $\phi^{4}$ model. Analyzing these models systematically via modern field-theoretic renormalization group methods has been a long-standing challenge ever since their introduction in the middle of 1970s. We survey the recent progress made in this direction, discussing results obtained via dimensionality expansions, how they compare with Monte Carlo results, and open problems. These advances opened the way towards systematic studies of boundary critical behavior at $m$-axial Lifshitz points. The possible boundary critical behavior depends on whether the surface plane is perpendicular to one of the $m$ modulation axes or parallel to all of them. We show that the semi-infinite field theories representing the corresponding surface universality classes in these two cases of perpendicular and parallel surface orientation differ crucially in their Hamiltonian's boundary terms and the implied boundary conditions, and explain recent results along with our current understanding of this matter.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we discuss why functional renormalization is an essential tool to treat strongly disordered systems. More specifically, we treat elastic manifolds in a disordered environment. These are governed by a disorder distribution, which after a finite renormalization becomes non-analytic, thus overcoming the predictions of the seemingly exact dimensional reduction. We discuss how a renormalizable field theory can be constructed even beyond 2-loop order. We then consider an elastic manifold embedded in $N$ dimensions, and give the exact solution for $N \rightarrow \infty$. This is compared to predictions of the Gaussian replica variational ansatz, using replica symmetry breaking. Finally, the effective action at order $1/N$ is reported.</p>

The nonequilibrium stationary state of this model factorises and this property allows a detailed analysis of several `condensation' transitions wherein a finite fraction of the constituent particles condenses onto a single lattice site. I will then consider a more general class of mass transport models, encompassing continuous mass variables and discrete time updating, and present a necessary and sufficient condition for the steady state to factorise. The property of factorisation again allows an analysis of the condensation transitions which may occur.</p>

				<title>Nonequilibrium relaxation method – An alternative simulation strategy</title>
				<feature>Invited Talks:- Topic 3: Nonequilibrium processes (transport theory, relaxation phenomena, random processes)</feature>
				<page>0871-0880</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One well-established simulation strategy to study the thermal phases and transitions of a given microscopic model system is the so-called equilibrium method, in which one first realizes the equilibrium ensemble of a finite system and then extrapolates the results to infinite system. This equilibrium method traces over the standard theory of the thermal statistical mechanics, and over the idea of the thermodynamic limit. Recently, an alternative simulation strategy has been developed, which analyzes the nonequilibrium relaxation {\bf (NER)} process. It is called the {\bf NER} method. {\bf NER} method has some advantages over the equilibrium method. The {\bf NER} method provides a simpler analyzing procedure. This implies less systematic error which is inevitable in the simulation and provides efficient resource usage. The {\bf NER} method easily treats not only the thermodynamic limit but also other limits, for example, non-Gibbsian nonequilibrium steady states. So the {\bf NER} method is also relevant for new fields of the statistical physics. Application of the {\bf NER} method have been expanding to various problems: from basic first- and second-order transitions to advanced and exotic phases like chiral, {\bf KT} spin-glass and quantum phases. These studies have provided, not only better estimations of transition point and exponents, but also qualitative developments. For example, the universality class of a random system, the nature of the two-dimensional melting and the scaling behavior of spin-glass aging phenomena have been clarified.</p>

The freely cooling system is examined concerning the energy decay and the cluster evolution in time. Corrections for crystallization and multi-particle contacts are provided, which become more and more important with increasing density.</p>

				<title>Control and characterization of spatio-temporal disorder in parametrically excited surface waves</title>

				<page>0903-0913</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nonlinear interactions of parametrically excited surface waves have been shown to yield a rich family of nonlinear states. When the system is driven by two commensurate frequencies, a variety of interesting superlattice type states are generated via a number of different 3-wave resonant interactions. These states occur either as symmetry-breaking bifurcations of hexagonal patterns composed of a single unstable mode or via nonlinear interactions between the two different unstable modes generated by the two forcing frequencies. Near the system’s bicritical point, a well-defined region of phase space exists in which a highly disordered state, both in space and time, is observed. We first show that this state results from the competition between two distinct nonlinear superlattice states, each with different characteristic temporal and spatial symmetries. After characterizing the type of spatio-temporal disorder that is embodied in this disordered state, we will demonstrate that it can be controlled. Control to either of its neighboring nonlinear states is achieved by the application of a small-amplitude excitation at a third frequency, where the spatial symmetry of the selected pattern is determined by the temporal symmetry of the third frequency used. This technique can also excite rapid switching between different nonlinear states.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Pattern formations in chaotic spatio-temporal systems modelled by coupled chaotic oscillators are investigated. We focus on various symmetry breakings and different kinds of chaos synchronization–desynchronization transitions, which lead to certain types of spontaneous spatial orderings and the emergence of some typical ordered patterns, such as rotating wave patterns with splay phase ordering (orientational symmetry breaking) and partially synchronous standing wave patterns with in-phase ordering (translational symmetry breaking). General pictures of the global behaviors of pattern formations and transitions in coupled chaotic oscillators are provided.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We recall that at both the intermittency transitions and the Feigenbaum attractor, in unimodal maps of non-linearity of order $\zeta &#62; 1$, the dynamics rigorously obeys the Tsallis statistics. We account for the $q$-indices and the generalized Lyapunov coefficients $\lambda_{q}$ that characterize the universality classes of the pitchfork and tangent bifurcations. We identify the Mori singularities in the Lyapunov spectrum at the onset of chaos with the appearance of a special value for the entropic index $q$. The physical area of the Tsallis statistics is further probed by considering the dynamics near criticality and glass formation in thermal systems. In both cases a close connection is made with states in unimodal maps with vanishing Lyapunov coefficients.</p>

					<p>We report experimental studies of jamming phenomenon of monodisperse metal disks falling through a two-dimensional hopper when the hopper opening is larger than three times the size of the disks. For each jamming event, the configuration of the arch formed at the hopper opening is studied. The cumulative distribution functions $f_{d}(X)$ for hoppers of opening size d are measured. (Here $X$ is the horizontal component of the arch vector, which is defined as the displacement vector from the center of the first disk to the center of the last disk in the arch.) We found that the distribution of $f_{d}(X)$ can be collasped into a master curve $G(X) = f_{d}(X)\mu(d)$ that decays exponentially for $X &#62; 4$. The scaling factor $\mu(d)$ is a decreasing function of d and is approximately proportional to the jamming probability. </p>

				<abstract>
					<p>While binary {\bf (A,B)} symmetric polymer mixtures in $d = 3$ dimensions have an unmixing critical point that belongs to the $3d$ Ising universality class and crosses over to mean field behavior for very long chains, the critical behavior of mixtures confined into thin film geometry falls in the $2d$ Ising class irrespective of chain length. The critical temperature always scales linearly with chain length, except for strictly two-dimensional chains confined to a plane, for which $T_{c} \alpha N^{5/8}$ (this unusual exponent describes the fractal contact line between segregated chains in dense melts in two spatial dimensions, $d = 2$). When the walls of the thin film are not neutral, but preferentially attract one species, complex phase diagrams occur due to the interplay between capillary condensation and wetting phenomena. For `competing walls' (one wall prefers A, the other prefers B) particularly interesting interface localization–delocalization transitions occur, while analogous phenomena in wedges are related to the `filling transition'. </p>

					<p>In a fluctuating medium of quantum, thermal, or non-thermal origin, an interaction is induced between external objects that modify the fluctuations. These interactions can appear in a vast variety of systems, leading to a plethora of interesting phenomena. Notable examples of these include: (1) like-charge attraction in the presence of multivalent counterions, (2) Ludwig–Soret effect in charged colloids, (3) mass renormalization of moving defects in a phononic background and moving metallic objects in {\bf EM} quantum vacuum, and (4) dissipation due to motion-induced radiation. The fluctuation-induced forces are statistical in nature, and this could make their measurement very difficult, because the actual value of the force might deviate most of the time from the predicted average value.</p>

We investigate the thermodynamic (density, magnetization, density of states) and transport (conductivity) properties using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo and inhomogeneous Hartree Fock techniques. We find that at half filling there is a novel metallic phase at intermediate disorder that is sandwiched between a Mott insulator and an Anderson insulator. The metallic phase is highly inhomogeneous and coexists with antiferromagnetic long-range order. At quarter filling also the combined effects of disorder and interactions produce a conducting state which can be destroyed by applying a Zeeman field, resulting in a magnetic field-driven transition. We discuss the implication of our results for experiments. </p>

					<p>Rare earth manganites doped with alkaline earths, namely Re$_{1-x}$A$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$, exhibit colossal magnetoresistance, metal insulator transitions, competing magnetic, orbital and charge ordering, and many other interesting but poorly understood phenomena. In this article  I outline our recent theory based on the idea that in the presence of strong Jahn–Teller, Coulomb and Hund’s couplings present in these materials, the low-energy electronic states dynamically reorganize themselves into two sets: one set $(\ell)$ which are polaronic, i.e., localized and accompanied by large local lattice distortion, and another (b) which are non-polaronic and band-like. The coexistence of the radically different $\ell$ and $b$ states, and the sensitive dependence of their relative energies and occupation upon doping $x$, temperature $T$, magnetic field $H$, etc., underlies the unique effects seen in manganites. I present results from strong correlation calculations using dynamical mean-field theory and simulations on a new 2-fluid model which accord with a variety of observations.</p>

					<p>Two classes of models of driven disordered systems that exhibit history-dependent dynamics are discussed. The first class incorporates local inertia in the dynamics via nonmonotonic stress transfer between adjacent degrees of freedom. The second class allows for proliferation of topological defects due to the interplay of strong disorder and drive. In mean field theory both models exhibit a tricritical point as a function of disorder strength. At weak disorder depinning is continuous and the sliding state is unique. At strong disorder depinning is discontinuous and hysteretic. </p>

					<p>In this paper, we review several important features of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of spin glasses. Starting with the simplest experiments, we discuss the scaling laws used to describe the isothermal aging observed in spin glasses after a quench down to the low-temperature phase. We report in particular new results on the sub-aging behaviour of spin glasses. We then discuss the rejuvenation and memory effects observed when a spin glass is submitted to temperature variations during aging, from the point of view of both energy landscape pictures and real-space pictures. We highlight the fact that both approaches point out the necessity of hierarchical processes involved in aging. Finally, we report an investigation of the effect of small temperature variations on aging in spin glass samples with various anisotropies which indicates that this hierarchy depends on the spin anisotropy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Biomolecules carry out very specialized tasks inside the cell where energies involved are few tens of $k_{B}T$ , small enough for thermal fluctuations to be relevant in many biomolecular processes. In this paper I discuss a few concepts and present some experimental results that show how the study of fluctuation theorems applied to biomolecules contributes to our understanding of the nonequilibrium thermal behavior of small systems.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We introduce a simple algorithm that constructs scale-free random graphs efficiently: each vertex $i$ has a prescribed weight $P_{i} \alpha i^{−\mu} (0 &#60; \mu &#60; 1)$ and an edge can connect vertices $i$ and $j$ with rate $P_{i} P_{j}$. Corresponding equilibrium ensemble is identified and the problem is solved by the $q \rightarrow 1$ limit of the $q$-state Potts model with inhomogeneous interactions for all pairs of spins. The number of loops as well as the giant cluster size and the mean cluster size are obtained in the thermodynamic limit as a function of the edge density. Various critical exponents associated with the percolation transition are also obtained together with finite-size scaling forms. The process of forming the giant cluster is qualitatively different between the cases of $\lambda &#62; 3$ and $2 &#60; \lambda  &#60; 3$, where $\lambda = 1 + \mu^{-1}$ is the degree distribution exponent. While for the former, the giant cluster forms abruptly at the percolation transition, for the latter, however, the formation of the giant cluster is gradual and the mean cluster size for finite $N$ shows double peaks.</p>

				<page>1161-1173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The combinatorial problem of satisfying a given set of constraints that depend on {\bf N} discrete variables is a fundamental one in optimization and coding theory. Even for instances of randomly generated problems, the question ``does there exist an assignment to the variables that satisfies all constraints?" may become extraordinarily difficult to solve in some range of parameters where a glass phase sets in. We shall provide a brief review of the recent advances in the statistical mechanics approach to these satisfiability problems and show how the analytic results have helped to design a new class of message-passing algorithms – the survey propagation {\bf (SP)} algorithms – that can efficiently solve some combinatorial problems considered intractable. As an application, we discuss how the packing properties of clusters of solutions in randomly generated satisfiability problems can be exploited in the design of simple lossy data compression algorithms.</p>

				<page>1175-1189</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study the random $m$-ary search tree model (where $m$ stands for the number of branches of the search tree), an important problem for data storage in computer science, using a variety of statistical physics techniques that allow us to obtain exact asymptotic results. In particular, we show that the probability distributions of extreme observables associated with a random search tree such as the height and the balanced height of a tree have a travelling front structure. In addition, the variance of the number of nodes needed to store a data string of a given size $N$ is shown to undergo a striking phase transition at a critical value of the branching ratio $m_{c} = 26$. We identified the mechanism of this phase transition and showed that it is generic and occurs in various other problems as well. New results are obtained when each element of the data string is a $D$-dimensional vector. We show that this problem also has a phase transition at a critical dimension, $D_{c} = \pi/sin^{−1} (1/\sqrt{8}) = 8.69363 . . ..$</p>

				<title>The generalized pseudospectral approach to the bound states of the Hulthén and the Yukawa potentials</title> 
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0001-0015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The generalized pseudospectral {\bf (GPS)} method is employed to calculate the bound states of the Hulthén and the Yukawa potentials in quantum mechanics, with special emphasis on {\textit{higher}} excited states and {\textit{stronger}} couplings. Accurate energy eigenvalues, expectation values and radial probability densities are obtained through a non-uniform and optimal spatial discretization of the radial Schrödinger equation. Results accurate up to thirteen to fourteen significant figures are reported for all the 55 eigenstates of both these potentials with $n \leq 10$ for arbitrary values of the screening parameters covering a wide range of interaction. Furthermore, excited states as high as $n = 17$ have been computed with good accuracy for both these potentials. Excellent agreement with the available literature data has been observed in all cases. The $n &#62; 6$ states of the Yukawa potential has been considerably improved over all other existing results currently available, while the same for Hulthén potential are reported here for the first time. Excepting the $1s$ and $2s$ states of the Yukawa potential, the present method surpasses the accuracy of all other existing results in the stronger coupling region for all other states of both these systems. This offers a simple and efficient scheme for the accurate calculation of these and other screened Coulomb potentials.</p>

				<title>Stability of naked singularity arising in gravitational collapse of Type I matter fields</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0017-0033</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Considering gravitational collapse of Type {\bf I} matter fields, we prove that, given an arbitrary $C^{2}-mass function $M(r, v)$ and a $C^{1}-function $h(r, v)$ (through the corresponding $C^{1}$-metric function $\nu(t, r)$), there exist infinitely many choices of energy distribution function $b(r)$ such that the ‘true’ initial data $(M, h(r, v)$) leads the collapse to the formation of naked singularity. We further prove that the occurrence of such a naked singularity is stable with respect to small changes in the initial data. We remark that though the initial data leading to both black hole {\bf (BH)} and naked singularity {\bf (NS)} form a `big' subset of the true initial data set, their occurrence is not generic. The terms `stability' and ‘genericity’ are appropriately defined following the theory of dynamical systems. The particular case of radial pressure $p_{r}(r)$ has been illustrated in details to get a clear picture of how naked singularity is formed and how, it is stable with respect to initial data.</p>

					<p>The infinite square well potential in one dimension has a smooth supersymmetric partner potential which is shape invariant. In this paper, we study the generalization of this to two dimensions by constructing the supersymmetric partner of the disk billiard. We find that the property of shape invariance is lost in this case. Nevertheless, the {\bf WKB} results are significantly improved when {\bf SWKB} calculations are performed with the square of the superpotential. We also study the effect of inserting a singular flux line through the center of the disk. </p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0061-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We adopt the potential harmonics expansion method for an {\textit{ab initio}} solution of the many-body system in a Bose condensate containing interacting bosons. Unlike commonly adopted mean-field theories, our method is capable of handling two-body correlation properly. We disregard three- and higher-body correlations. This simplification is ideally suited to dilute Bose Einstein condensates, whose number density is required to be so small that the interparticle separation is much larger than the range of two-body interaction to avoid three- and higher-body collisions, leading to the formation of molecules and consequent instability of the condensate. In our method we can incorporate realistic finite range interactions. We calculate energies of low-lying states of a condensate containing $^{23}$Na atoms and some thermodynamical properties of the condensate.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0085-0093</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present in this communication the results of our first Born calculation in the three-Coulomb {\bf (3C)} wave approach for the $(e, 3e)$ process on He and He-like ions at an incident electron energy {\bf 5599 eV} in the coplanar constant $\theta_{12}$ as well as out-of-plane constant $\phi_{12}$ modes. These two geometrical modes are such that the quasi-binary collision between the incident electron and centre of mass of the ejected electrons is in the scattering plane. The theoretical formalism has been developed using plane waves, {\bf Le} Sech wave function and approximated {\bf BBK}-type wave function respectively for the incident and scattered, bound and ejected electrons to calculate five-fold differential cross-section {\bf (FDCS)} of the {\bf (e, 3e)} process. We emphasize on the similarities and dissimilarities (asymmetries) in the angular profile of the {\bf FDCS} in two modes as well as the effects of post-collision interaction (between the ejected electrons) and nuclear charge $Z$ on the angular profile of the {\bf FDCS}. We observe that with the increment of nuclear charge the two quasi-binary collisions approach towards identical behaviour at larger mutual angles and thus bringing less asymmetry in {\bf FDCS} for higher $Z$ target. </p>

					<p>The formation of the sheath in a dusty plasma is investigated. The Bohm criterion is derived for two different cases: (a) when electrons are in thermodynamic equilibrium and dust grains provide the immobile, stationary background and (b) when both electrons and ions are in thermodynamic equilibrium and dust grains are moving. In the first case, Bohm criterion gets modified due to the fluctuation of the charge on the grain surface. In the second case, the collisional and Coulombic drag play important role in determining the Bohm criterion. </p>

The {\bf BS} background profiles for {\bf Hg}, computed within the Born approximation, are estimated for different values of incident energy. It is seen for the first time that the {\bf BS} background contribution in high-energy Compton profile experiments like those employing third generation synchrotron radiation sources comes out to be significant and non-linear. Further, it is found that the incorporation of {\bf BS} correction in data reduction of such an experiment performed on {\bf Hg} at {\bf 662 keV} energy helps in reconciliation of theory and experiment. </p>

				<page>0165-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigated quantum states with continuous spectrum for a general time-dependent oscillator using invariant operator and unitary transformation methods together. The form of the transformed invariant operator by a unitary operator is the same as the Hamiltonian of the simple harmonic oscillator: $\hat{I'} = \hat{p}^{2}/2 + \omega^{2}\hat{q}^{2}/2$. The fact that $\omega^{2}$ of the transformed invariant operator is constant enabled us to investigate the system separately for three cases, where $\omega^{2} &#62; 0$, $\omega^{2} &#60; 0$, and $\omega^{2} = 0$. The eigenstates of the system are discrete for $\omega^{2} &#62; 0$. On the other hand, for $\omega^{2} \leq 0$, the eigenstates are continuous. The time-dependent oscillators whose spectra of the wave function are continuous are not oscillatory. The wave function for $\omega^{2} &#60; 0$ is expressed in terms of the parabolic cylinder function. We applied our theory to the driven harmonic oscillator with strongly pulsating mass. </p>

Diverse periodic wave solutions may be produced by appropriately selecting these arbitrary functions as the Jacobi elliptic functions. The interaction properties of the periodic waves are investigated numerically and found to be nonelastic. The long wave limit yields some new types of solitary wave solutions.

					<p>At low $x$, an analytic solution of the {\bf DGLAP} equation for gluon in the next-to-leading order {\bf (NLO)} is obtained by applying the method of characteristics. Its compatibility with double leading logarithmic approximation {\bf (DLLA)} asymptotics is discussed and comparison with the exact ones like {\bf GRV98NLO} is made. The solution is then utilized to calculate the derivatives $\dfrac{\partial F_{2} (x, Q^{2})}{\partial {\text{ln}} Q^{2}}$ and $\dfrac{\partial {\text{ln}} F_{2} (x, Q^{2})}{\partial {\text{ln}} (1/x)}$ and compared with the recent {\bf HERA} data. Our solution is found to reproduce most of the essential features of the data on the derivatives.</p>

				<title>Relativistic theory of inverse beta-decay of polarized neutron in strong magnetic field </title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0215-0244</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relativistic theory of the inverse beta-decay of polarized neutron, $v_{e} + n \rightarrow p + e^{-}$, in strong magnetic field is developed. For the proton wave function we use the exact solution of the Dirac equation in the magnetic filed that enables us to account exactly for effects of the proton momentum quantization in the magnetic field and also for the proton recoil motion. The effect of nucleons anomalous magnetic moments in strong magnetic fields is also discussed. We examine the cross-section for different energies and directions of propagation of the initial neutrino accounting for neutron polarization. It is shown that in the super-strong magnetic field the totally polarized neutron matter is transparent for neutrinos propagating antiparallel to the direction of polarization. The developed relativistic approach can be used for calculations of cross-sections of the other {\bf URCA} processes in strong magnetic fields.</p>

				<title>Role of guard rings in improving the performance of silicon detectors </title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0259-0272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>{\bf BARC} has developed large-area silicon detectors in collaboration with {\bf BEL} to be used in the pre-shower detector of the {\bf CMS} experiment at {\bf CERN}. The use of floating guard rings {\bf (FGR)} in improving breakdown voltage and reducing leakage current of silicon detectors is well-known. In the present work, it has been demonstrated that {\bf FGR}s can also be used to improve the spectroscopic response of silicon detectors. The results have been confirmed by carrying out α-particle {\bf ($\approx 5$ MeV)} and $\gamma$-ray {\bf (60 keV)} spectroscopies with the {\bf FGR} floating or biased and the underlying physics aspect behind the change in spectra is explained. Although reduction in leakage current after biasing one of the guard rings has been reported earlier, the role of a guard ring in improving the spectroscopic response is reported for the first time. Results of {\bf TCAD} simulations for silicon detectors with the guard ring under different biasing conditions have been presented. Low yield in producing large-area silicon detectors makes them very costly. However, with one of the {\bf FGR}s biased even a detector having large surface leakage current can be used to give the same response as a very good detector. This makes the use of large-area silicon detectors very economical as the yield would be very high (&#62; 90\%). </p>

					<p>A high-performance, low-cost, leading edge discriminator has been designed with a timing performance comparable to state-of-the-art, commercially available discriminators. A timing error of 16 ps is achieved under ideal operating conditions. Under more realistic operating conditions the discriminator displays a timing error of 90 ps. It has an intrinsic double pulse resolution of 4 ns which is better than most commercial discriminators.

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0297-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we analytically compute the strength of nonlinear interactions in a triad, and the energy exchanges between wave-number shells in incompressible fluid turbulence. The computation has been done using first-order perturbative field theory. In three dimensions, magnitude of triad interactions is large for nonlocal triads, and small for local triads. However, the shell-to-shell energy transfer rate is found to be local and forward. This result is due to the fact that the nonlocal triads occupy much less Fourier space volume than the local ones. The analytical results on three-dimensional shell-to-shell energy transfer match with their numerical counterparts. In two-dimensional turbulence, the energy transfer rates to the nearby shells are forward, but to the distant shells are backward; the cumulative effect is an inverse cascade of energy.</p>

					<p>A microwave propagating along vacuum–dielectric–plasma interface excites surface plasma wave {\bf (SPW)}. A periodic slow-wave structure placed over dielectric slows down the {\bf SPW}. The phase velocity of slow {\bf SPW} is sensitive to height, periodicity, number of periods, thickness and the separation between dielectric and slow-wave structure. These slow {\bf SPW} can couple the microwave energy to the plasma and can sustain the discharge. The efficiency of the power coupling is few per cent and is sensitive to separation between dielectric and slow-wave structure.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper reports the experimental observations on the x-ray excited optical luminescence {\bf (XEOL)} along with the afterglow and colour center features found for the barium salts, represented by the formula, {\bf Ba$XY$}, where $X$ and $Y$ are the halides. The system thus consists of four dihalides {\bf (BaF$_{2}$, . . . ,BaI$_{2}$)} and six mixed halides {\bf (BaFCl,. . . ,BaBrI)}. To start with, it was found that on two of the binary halides of barium, {\bf BaClI} and {\bf BaBrI}, no literature exists, and so these were prepared for the first time and their crystal structures were determined. An x-ray generator of {\bf 3-kW} rating was next coupled to a spectrometer via a high throughput fiberoptic sensor for recording the luminescence spectra under x-irradiation. Also presented in this paper are the observations on the {\bf Ba$XY$} compounds in which about 0.1 mole$\%$ of {\bf Eu$^{2+}$} was doped, in order to study the efficiency between the prompt luminescence and the photostimulated luminescence in these compounds. The crystal structure varies from fluorite {\bf (BaF$_{2}$)}, to matlockite {\bf (BaF$X$)} and finally to orthorhombic {\bf (BaCl$_{2}$, . . .,BaBrI)} for these compounds. Hence searching for systematics and empirical relations in the observed {\bf XEOL} behaviour of these compounds is still a challenging problem.</p>

					<p>The study of electrical resistivity of compound-forming liquid alloy, {\bf NaPb}, is presented as a function of concentration. Hard sphere diameters of {\bf Na} and {\bf Pb} are obtained through the interionic pair potentials evaluated using Troullier and Martins {\textit{ab initio}} pseudopotential, which have been used to calculate the partial structure factors $S(q)$. Considering the liquid alloy to be a ternary mixture, Ziman formula, modified for complex formation has been used for calculating resistivity of binary liquid alloys. Form factors are calculated using {\textit{ab initio}} pseudopotentials. The results suggest that Ziman formalism, when used with {\textit{ab initio}} pseudopotentials, are quite successful in explaining the electrical resistivity data of compound-forming binary liquid alloys. </p>

				<title>The incompatibility between local hidden variable theories and the fundamental conservation laws</title>

				<page>0359-0379</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>I discuss in detail the result that the Bell's inequalities derived in the context of local hidden variable theories for discrete quantized observables can be satisfied only if a fundamental conservation law is violated on the average. This result shows that such theories are physically nonviable, and makes the demarcating criteria of the Bell's inequalities redundant. I show that a unique correlation function can be derived from the validity of the conservation law alone and this coincides with the quantum mechanical correlation function. Thus, any theory with a different correlation function, like any local hidden variable theory, is incompatible with the fundamental conservation laws and space-time symmetries. The results are discussed in the context of two-particle singlet and triplet states, {\bf GHZ} states, and two-particle double slit interferometry. Some observations on quantum entropy, entanglement, and nonlocality are also discussed.</p>

					<p>The exotic baryon $\Theta^{+}$ (1540 MeV) is visualized as an expected (iso) rotational excitation in the chiral soliton model. It is also argued as a pentaquark baryon state in a constituent quark model with strong diquark correlations. I contrast these two points of view; observe the similarities and differences between the two pictures. Collective excitation, the characteristic of chiral soliton model, points toward small mixing of representations in the wake of $SU (3)$ breaking. In contrast, constituent quark models prefer near `ideal' mixing, similar to $\omega - \phi$ mixing.</p>

				<title>A correspondence between IBA-1 and IBA-2 models and electromagnetic transitions in the decay of some erbium isotopes</title>

				<page>0393-0402</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interacting boson approximation {\bf IBA-1} model space, in which neutron and proton degrees of freedom are not distinguished, can be considered as a subspace of the {\bf IBA-2} model space. Using the microscopic background of the {\bf IBA-2} model, a correspondence can be established between {\bf IBA-1} and {\bf IBA-2} model space. Since the space of the {\bf IBA-1} model can be regarded as a subspace of the {\bf IBA-2} model there is a unique way to `Project' the operators of the {\bf IBA-2} model onto those of {\bf IBA-1}. This projection can be carried out using the $F$-spin formalism. In the {\bf IBA-2} model, the lowest states are indeed fully symmetric, and using the calculations with the help of this projection, we explore the energy levels and the electric quadrupole transition probabilities $B(E2; I_{i} \rightarrow I_{f})$ and $\gamma$-ray $E2/M1$ mixing ratios for selected transitions of $^{162,164,166,168,170}${\bf Er}. Owing to admixtures of non-fully-symmetric states in {\bf IBA-2}, we renormalized the parameters ($\varepsilon$) and ($\kappa$). This is the first time we show that this projection can be applied to some heavier isotopes and the results obtained for $^{162,164,166,168,170}${\bf Er} isotopes are reasonably in good agreement with the previous experimental values.</p>

				<title>Scattering of light by a periodic structure in the presence of randomness IV. Limit of detection by curve fitting</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0413-0424</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the context of scattering of light, we determine the extent of randomness within which a hidden periodic part can still be detected. The detection is carried out using a technique called the extended matched filtering, first introduced by us in this context. The earlier prediction, before our technique was introduced, had placed the limit of detection, by intensity measurements alone, at $(r_{0}/\Lambda) \sim 0.33$, where $r_{0}$ is the coherence length of light for scattering by the rough part of the surface and $\Lambda$ is the wavelength of the periodic part of the surface. In our earlier works we have shown that by intensity measurements alone, the limit of detection can be taken to a much lower value of $(r_{0} /\Lambda)$, when the extended matched filtering method is employed. In this paper we follow the extended matched filtering method, and try to reach the lowest possible value of detection in $(r_{0}/\Lambda)$ by fitting the data to a polynomial. It is concluded by our numerical work that the lowest possible limit for detection from intensity measurements alone is $(r_{0}/\Lambda) = 0.11$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have presented an investigation of the induced focusing in Kerr media of two laser beams, the pump beam and the probe beam, which could be either Gaussian or elliptic Gaussian or a combination of the two. We have used variational formalism to derive relevant beam-width equations. Among several important findings, the finding that a very week probe beam can be guided and focused when power of both beams are well below their individual threshold for self-focusing, is a noteworthy one. It has been found that induced focusing is not possible for laser beams of any wavelength and beam radius. In case both beams are elliptic Gaussian, we have shown that when power of both beams is above a certain threshold value then the effective radius of both beams collapses and collapse distance depends on power. Moreover, it has been found that induced focusing can be employed to convert a circular Gaussian beam into an elliptic Gaussian beam.</p>

				<title>The shape of an axisymmetric bubble in uniform motion</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0437-0455</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We consider in a frame fixed to a bubble translating with steady speed $U$, the inviscid, axisymmetric, irrotational motion of the liquid past it. If all speeds are normalized by $U$ and lengths by $T/\dfrac{1}{2} \varrho U^{2}, where $T$ is the surface tension of the liquid–bubble interface, it can be shown that the unknown bubble shape and field depend on a single parameter $\Gamma = (p_{b} − p_{\infty})/\dfrac{1}{2} \varrho U^{2} − 1$ alone, where the pressures are the ones in the bubble and far away respectively. When $\Gamma$ is very large the bubble is almost spherical in shape while for $\Gamma \leq \Gamma^{*} \approx -0.315$, bubbles whose exteriors are simply connected do not exist. We solve the non-linear, free boundary problem for the whole range $\Gamma^{*} &#60; \Gamma &#60; \infty$ by the use of an analytical representation for the bubble shape, a surface singularity method to compute potential flows and a generalized Newton's method to continue in $\Gamma$. Apart from providing explicit representations for bubble shapes and detailed numerical values for the bubble parameters, we show that the classical linearized solution for large $\Gamma$ is a very good approximation, surprisingly, to as low values of $\Gamma$ as 2. We also show that Miksis {\textit{et al}} $[1]$ is inaccurate over the whole range and in serious error for large and small $\Gamma$. These have been corrected.</p>

				<title>Material parameters for thermoelectric performance</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0469-0479</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The thermoelectric performance of a thermoelement is ideally defined in terms of the so-called figure-of-merit $Z = \alpga^{2} \sigma/ \lambda$, where $\alpha, \sigma$ and $\lambda$ refer respectively to the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of the thermoelement material. However, there are other parameters which are fairly good indicators of a material's thermoelectric `worth'. A simple yet useful performance indicator is possible with only two parameters-energy gap and lattice thermal conductivity. This indicator can outline all potentially useful thermoelectric materials. Thermal conductivity in place of lattice thermal conductivity can provide some additional information about the temperature range of operation. Yet another performance indicator may be based on the slope of $\alpha$ vs. ln $\sigma$ plots. $\alpha$ plotted against ln $\sigma$ shows a linear relationship in a simplified model, but shows a variation with temperature and carrier concentration. Assuming that such a relationship is true for a narrow range of temperature and carrier concentration, one can calculate the slope $m$ of $\alpha$ vs. ln $\sigma$ plots against temperature and carrier concentrations. A comparison between the variation of $ZT$ and slope $m$ suggests that such plots may be useful to identify potential thermoelectric materials.</p>

					<p>The compositional dependence of elastic properties of Al$^{3+}$ -substituted Bi(Pb)-2223 superconducting system with the general formula Bi$_{1.7-x}$Al$_{x}$Pb$_{0.3}$Sr$_{2}Ca$_{2}$-Cu$_{3}$O$_{y}$ ($x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2$ and $0.3$) have been studied by means of ultrasonic pulse transmission {\bf (UPT)} technique at {\bf 1 MHz (300 K)}. The elastic moduli of the specimens are computed and corrected to zero porosity. The observed variation of elastic constants with aluminium substitution has been explained on the basis of the strength of inter-atomic bonding. The applicability of heterogeneous metal mixture rule for estimating elastic constants and transition temperature has been tested.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0491-0500</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The magnetic behavior of a solid solution, {\bf Ca$_{3-x}$Y$-{x}$Co$_{2}$O$_{6}$}, based on the `exotic' spin-chain compound, {\bf Ca$_{3}$Co$_{2}$O$_{6}$}, crystallizing in {\bf K$_{4}$CdCl$_{6}$}-derived rhombohedral structure is investigated. Among the compositions investigated ($x = 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75$ and $1.0$), single-phase formation persists up to $x = 0.75, with the elongation of the $c$-axis. The present investigations reveal that the temperature at which the `so-called' `partially disordered antiferromagnetic structure' sets in (which occurs at {\bf 24 K} for the parent compound, $x = 0.0$) undergoes gradual reduction with the substitution of {\bf Y} for {\bf Ca}, attaining the value of about {\bf 2.2 K} for the nominal $x = 1.0$. The trend observed in this characteristic temperature is opposite to that reported under external pressure, thereby establishing that {\bf Y} substitution exerts negative chemical pressure. Anomalous steps observed in the isothermal magnetization at very low temperatures (around {\bf 2 K}) for $x = 0.0$, which have been proposed to arise from `quantum tunneling effects' are found to vanish by a small substitution ($x = 0.3$) of {\bf Y} for {\bf Ca}. Systematics in {\bf AC} and {\bf DC} magnetic susceptibility behavior with {\bf Y} substitution for {\bf Ca} have also been probed. We believe that the present results involving the expansion of chain length without disrupting the magnetic chain may be useful to the overall understanding of the novel magnetism of the parent compound.</p>

				<title>Theoretical study of two-element array of equilateral triangular patch microstrip antenna on ferrite substrate</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0501-0512</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The radiation characteristics of a two-element array of equilateral triangular patch microstrip antenna on a ferrite substrate are studied theoretically by considering the presence of bias magnetic field in the direction of propagation of electromagnetic waves. It is found that the natural modes of propagation in the direction of magnetic field are left- and right-circularly polarized waves and these modes have different propagation constants. In loss-less isotropic warm plasma, this array antenna geometry excites both electromagnetic {\bf (EM)} and electroacoustic plasma {\bf (P)} waves in addition to a nonradiating surface wave. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the {\bf EM}- and {\bf P}-waves can be decoupled into two independent modes, the electroacoustic mode is longitudinal while the electromagnetic mode is transverse. The far-zone {\bf EM}-mode and {\bf P}-mode radiation fields are derived using vector wave function techniques and pattern multiplication approaches. The results are obtained in both plasma medium and free space. Some important antenna parameters such as radiation conductance, directivity and quality factor are plotted for different values of plasma-to-source frequency.</p>

It is found that the parameter values obtained by our analysis are significantly different from those obtained from the closed expression for K$^{+}$ -nucleus amplitude derived by the strong absorption approximation. Next, using the phase shift obtained from the present analysis we calculate the K$^{+}$ optical model potentials for $^{12}$C and $^{40}$Ca by the method of inversion.

					<p>The Kirkwood–Frohlich correlation factor $(g)$, Eyring's parameters $G$ and $G^{∗}$ and the dipolar excess free energies of dilute solutions of formamide, acetamide, $N$-methyl acetamide, $N, N$-dimethyl formamide and $N, N$ -dimethyl acetamide in 1,4-dioxan/benzene were obtained from a measurement of their static dielectric permittivities at 308 K. The fluid structure of these amides is discussed. Both in formamide and acetamide a dimeric linear chain with the individual dipoles more or less parallely oriented is preferred. In $N$-methyl acetamide, the antiparallel orientation of dipoles at lower concentrations turns into a parallel orientation with increase of concentration. In tertiary amides, with increase of concentration, parallel orientation of dipoles with global value of $g$ tending to unity is observed. The dipolar excess free energy of mixing in a given solvent is of the order primary amide &#62; secondary amide &#62; tertiary amide.</p>

					<p>Singly and doubly doped {\bf ZnS} phosphors have been synthesized using flux method. Laser-induced photoluminescence has been observed in {\bf ZnS}-doped phosphors when these were excited by the pulsed {\bf UV N$_{2}$} laser radiation. Due to down-conversion phenomenon, fast phosphorescence emission in the visible region is recorded in milliseconds time domain for {\bf ZnS}:Mn while in the case of {\bf ZnS}:Mn:killer (Fe, Co and Ni) the lifetime reduces to microseconds time domain. Experimentally observed luminescent emission parameters of excited states such as, lifetimes, trap-depth values and decay constants have been reported here at room temperature. The high efficiency and fast recombination times observed in doped {\bf ZnS} phosphors make these materials very attractive for optoelectronic applications.</p>

					<p>Soft chemistry has emerged as an important means of generating nanocrystals, nanowires and other nanostructures of semiconducting materials. We describe the synthesis of {\bf CdS} and other metal chalcogenide nanocrystals by a solvothermal route. We also describe the synthesis of nanocrystals of {\bf AlN, GaN} and {\bf InN} by the reaction of hexamethyldisilazane with the corresponding metal chloride or metal cupferronate under solvothermal conditions. Nanowires of {\bf Se} and {\bf Te} have been obtained by a self-seeding solution-based method. A single source precursor based on urea complexes of metal chlorides gives rise to metal nitride nanocrystals, nanowires and nanotubes. The liquid-liquid interface provides an excellent medium for preparing single-crystalline films of metal chalcogenides.</p>

				<title>Flow-driven voltage generation in carbon nanotubes</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0571-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The flow of various liquids and gases over single-walled carbon nanotube bundles induces an electrical signal (voltage/current) in the sample along the direction of the flow. The electrical response generated by the flow of liquids is found to be logarithmic in the flow speed over a wide range. In contrast, voltage generated by the flow of gas is quadratically dependent on the gas flow velocity. It was found that the underlying physics for the generation of electrical signals by liquids and gases are different. For the liquid, the Coulombic interaction between the ions in the liquid and the charge carriers in the nanotube plays a key role while electrical signal generation due to gas flow is due to an interplay of Bernoulli's principle and Seebeck effect. Unlike the liquid case which is specific to the nanotubes, the gas flow effect can be seen for a variety of solids ranging from single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphite and doped semiconductors.</p>

The wire has been modelled using the {\bf Su}-Schreiffer-Heeger {\bf (SSH)} Hamiltonian and the current{voltage characteristics have been obtained using the Landauer's formalism. In the presence of strong electron-lattice coupling, we find that there are regions of negative differential resistance {\bf (NDR)} at some critical bias, due to the degeneracy in the energies of the frontier molecular orbitals. The presence of the applied bias and the electron{lattice coupling results in the delocalization of these low-lying molecular states leading to the {\bf NDR} behaviour.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present a mini-review of our recent work on spontaneous, self-organized creation of mesostructures in soft materials like thin films of polymeric liquids and elastic solids. These very small scale, highly confined systems are inherently unstable and thus self-organize into ordered structures which can be exploited for {\bf MEMS}, sensors, opto-electronic devices and a host of other nanotechnology applications. In particular, mesomechanics requires incorporation of intermolecular interactions and surface tension forces, which are usually inconsequential in classical macroscale mechanics. We point to some experiments and quasi-continuum simulations of self-organized structures in thin soft films which are germane not only to nanotechnology, but also to a spectrum of classical issues such as adhesion/debonding, wetting, coatings, tribology and membranes.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0621-0630</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we report a new method of fabrication of surface tension-confined microfluidic devices on glass. We have also successfully carried out some well-known chemical reactions in these fluidic channels to demonstrate the usefulness of these wall-less microchannels. The confined flow path of liquid was achieved on the basis of extreme differences in hydrophobic and hydrophilic characters of the surface. The flow paths were fabricated by making parallel lines using permanent marker pen ink or other polymer on glass surfaces. Two mirror image patterned glass plates were then sandwiched one on top of the other, separated by a thin gap - created using a spacer. The aqueous liquid moves between the surfaces by capillary forces, confined to the hydrophilic areas without wetting the hydrophobic lines, achieving liquid confinement without physical side-walls. We have shown that the microfluidic devices designed in such a way can be very useful due to their simplicity and low fabrication cost. More importantly, we have also demonstrated that the minimum requirement of such a working device is a hydrophilic line surrounded by hydrophobic environment, two walls of which are constituted of air and the rest is made of a hydrophobic surface.</p>

The discussion is divided into four sections, namely (a) chemistry of nanoparticles, (b) development of new synthetic approaches, (c) gas phase clusters and (d) device structures and applications. In `chemistry of nanoparticles' we describe a novel reaction between nanoparticles of {\bf Ag} and {\bf Au} with halocarbons. The reactions lead to the formation of various carbonaceous materials and metal halides. In `development of new synthetic approaches' our one-pot methodologies for the synthesis of core-shell nanosystems of {\bf Au, Ag} and {\bf Cu} protected with {\bf TiO$_{2}$} and {\bf ZrO$_{2}$} as well as various polymers are discussed. Some results on the interaction of nanoparticles with biomolecules are also detailed in this section. The third section covers the formation of gas phase aggregates/clusters of thiol-protected sub-nanoparticles. Laser desorption of {\bf H$_{2}$MoO$_{4}$, H$_{2}$WO$_{4}$, MoS$_{2}$, and WS$_{2}$} giving novel clusters is discussed. The fourth section deals with the development of simple devices and technologies using nanomaterials described above.</p>

				<title>Influence of CuO catalyst in the nanoscale range on SnO$_{2}$ surface for H$_{2}$S gas sensing applications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0647-0652</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dispersal of CuO catalyst on the surface of the semiconducting SnO$_{2}$ film is found to be of vital importance for improving the sensitivity and the response speed of a SnO$_{2}$ gas sensor for H$_{2}$S gas detection. Ultra-thin CuO islands (8 nm thin and 0.6 mm diameter) prepared by evaporating Cu through a mesh and subsequent oxidation yield a fast response speed and recovery. Ultimately nanoparticles of Cu (average size = 15 nm) prepared by a chemical technique using a reverse micelle method involving the reduction of Cu(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ by NaBH$_{4}$ exhibited significant improvement in the gas sensing characteristics of SnO$_{2}$ films. A fast response speed of $\sim 14$ s and a recovery time of $\sim 60$ s for trace level $\sim 20$ ppm H$_{2}$S gas detection have been recorded. The sensor operating temperature (130$^{\circ}$C) is low and the sensitivity ($S = 2.06 \times 10^{3}$) is high. It is found that the spreading over of CuO catalyst in the nanoscale range on the surface of SnO$_{2}$ allows e®ective removal of excess adsorbed oxygen from the uncovered SnO$_{2}$ surface due to spill over of hydrogen dissociated from the H$_{2}$S-CuO interaction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have measured the permeability of rhodamine-6G across C$\times$43 hemichannels reconstituted on a pipette tip. C$\times$43 hemichannels were overexpressed in Sf9 cells, and affinity-purified. The hemichannels were reconstituted in a lipid bilayer on a pipette tip by the tip-dip method. R6G in the pipette permeated across the channels into the bath. The permeability of R6G was quantified by measuring R6G concentration in the bath after several hours by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with 100 nm silver colloid particles. The ratio of the permeability of dye to salt, as extracted by this combined electrical-SERS technique, is compatible with similar ratios for other dyes across whole gap junction channels. The results for the permeability ratio were further compared to fluorescence measurements. The novel combination of patch and SERS techniques can be extended to quantifying the transport of biologically significant non-fluorescent molecules, such as cAMP and IP3, across 1 nm sized pores, such as the gap junction channel.</p>

				<title>Synthesis and characterization of water-soluble carbon nanotubes from mustard soot</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0681-0697</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbon nanotubes (CNT) has been synthesized by pyrolysing mustard oil using an oil lamp. It was made water-soluble (wsCNT) through oxidative treatment by dilute nitric acid and was characterized by SEM, AFM, XRD, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy. The synthesized wsCNT showed the presence of several junctions and defects in it. The presence of curved graphene structure (sp$^{2}$) with frequent sp$^{3}$ hybridized carbon is found to be responsible for the observed defects. These defects along with the presence of di- and tri-podal junctions showed interesting magnetic properties of carbon radicals formed by spin frustration. This trapped carbon radical showed ESR signal in aqueous solution and was very stable even under drastic treatment by strong oxidizing or reducing agents. Oxidative acid treatment of CNT introduced several carboxylic acid group functionalities in wsCNT along with the nicking of the CNT at different lengths with varied molecular weight. To evaluate molecular weights of these wsCNTs, an innovative method like gel electrophoresis using high molecular weight DNA as marker was introduced.</p>

				<page>0699-0705</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The optical tweezer is a versatile set-up that can be employed in a wide variety of studies investigating the microscopic properties of materials. In particular, this set-up has in recent times been gainfully employed in probing rheological properties of materials that exhibit viscoelasticity. These measurements can provide data at the micro and nanometer scales, not normally accessible by rheometers that are used for measurements on bulk samples. In this work we describe a single laser beam optical tweezer set-up, which is built around an inverted open microscope. The trapped polystyrene particle bead's deviation from the trap potential minimum is monitored by laser back-scattering technique and the bead position measured by a quadrant photodiode detector. Additionally, a provision is made for video microscopic studies on dispersed beads using a CCD camera. A single particle microrheological experiment that can be performed using the set-up is described with relevant calculations.</p>

					<p>The present work describes the synthesis of CdS/CdSSe glass nanocomposites and its characterization. A few glass compositions were optimized and the optimized host glass was remelted along with different semiconductors like CdS and CdSSe at high temperature. The CdS/CdSSe is present in amorphous state in the glass matrix. The thermal treatments have been carefully optimized to obtain well-defined uniform crystal growth of CdS and CdSSe. The glasses with optimized conditions were fabricated and characterized thoroughly using UV, TG/DTA and TEM. The shift in absorption edge to the longer wavelength with heat treatment implies the increase in the crystal size. The band gap has been increased with decrease in the particle size. Crystal size of semiconductors obtained by TEM was 2.5-5 nm for the glass showing absorption edge cut-off at 475 nm (CM-475).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The electrocatalytic activity of nanostructured copper particles (represented as Cu$_{\text{nano}}) incorporated Nafion (Nf) film-coated glassy carbon (GC) electrode (GC/Nf/Cu$_{\text{nano}}) towards oxygen reduction was investigated in oxygenated 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The electrodeposited Cu$_{\text{nano}} in Nf film was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrocatalytic activity of Cu$_{\text{nano}} at the modified electrode towards oxygen reduction was studied using cyclic voltammetry technique. The molecular oxygen reduction at the GC/Nf/Cu$_{\text{nano}}-modified electrode started at a more positive potential than at a bare GC electrode. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed in which oxygen reduction may proceed through two-step two-electron processes at the GC/Nf/Cu$_{\text{nano}} electrode. The GC/Nf/Cu$_{\text{nano}} electrode shows higher stability for oxygen reduction in neutral solution and the electrode may find applications in fuel cells.</p>

				<title>Investigations on the liquid crystalline phases of cation-induced condensed DNA</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0723-0729</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Viral and nonviral condensing agents are used in gene therapy to compact oligonucleotides and plasmid DNA into nanostructures for their efficient transport through the cell membranes. Whereas viral vectors are best by the toxic effects on the immune system, most of the nonviral delivery vehicles are not effective for use in clinical system. Recent investigations indicate that the supramolecular organization of DNA in the condensed state is liquid crystalline. The present level of understanding of the liquid crystalline phase of DNA is inadequate and a thorough investigation is required to understand the nature, stability, texture and the influence of various environmental conditions on the structure of the phase. The present study is mainly concerned with the physicochemical investigations on the liquid crystalline transitions during compaction of DNA by cationic species such as polyamines and metallic cations. As a preliminary to the above investigation, studies were conducted on the evolution of mesophase transitions of DNA with various cationic counterion species using polarized light microscopy. These studies indicated significant variations in the phase behaviour of DNA in the presence of Li and other ions. Apart from the neutralization of the charges on the DNA molecule, these ions are found to influence selectively the hydration sphere of DNA that in turn influences the induction and stabilization of the LC phases. The higher stability observed with the liquid crystalline phases of Li-DNA system could be useful in the production of nanostructured DNA. In the case of the polyamine, a structural specificity effect depending on the nature, charge and structure of the polyamine used has been found to be favoured in the crystallization of DNA.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chemical functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes with redox mediators, namely, toluidine blue and thionin have been carried out and the performance of graphite electrode modified with functionalized carbon nanotubes is described. Mechanical immobilization of functionalized single-walled nanotube (SWNT) on graphite electrode was achieved by gently rubbing the electrode surface on carbon nanotubes supported on a glass slide. The electrochemical behaviour of the modified electrodes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The SWNT-modified electrodes showed excellent electrocatalytic effect for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. A decrease in overvoltage was observed as well as an enhanced peak current compared to a bare graphite electrode for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic current was found to be directly proportional to the amount of hydrogen peroxide taken.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0739-0743</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction effects in magnetic nanoparticle system were studied through a Monte Carlo simulation. The results of simulations were compared with two different magnetic systems, namely, iron oxide polymer nanocomposites prepared by polymerization over core and nanocrystalline cobalt ferrite thin films prepared by sol–gel process. The size of the particles in the nanocomposites were estimated to be $\sim 15} nm with very little agglomeration. The low values of the coercivity obtained from the hysteresis measurements performed confirm that the system is superparamagnetic. SEM studies showed the cobalt ferrite films to have a nanocrystalline character, with particle sizes in the nanometer range. Hysteresis measurements performed on the thin films coated on silicon do not give evidence of the superparamagnetic transition up to room temperature and the coercivity is found to increase with decreasing film thickness. Comparison with simulations indicate that the nanocomposites behave like a strongly interacting array where exchange interactions lead to high blocking temperatures, whereas the films are representative of a semi-infinite array of magnetic clusters with weak interactions and thickness-dependent magnetic properties.</p>

Crystallization kinetics was analysed by Kissinger and Johnson–Mehl–Avrami approaches. In Al–Ni–La alloys, the crystallization pathways depend on the La concentration.

				<page>0753-0761</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of chain length on the adhesion behaviour of n-alkanethiols CH$_{3}$(CH$_{2}$)$_{n}$SH, where $n = 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14$ and $15$ has been followed by carrying out pull-off force measurement using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The self-assembled monolayers on Au(111) surface has been characterized by reflection absorption infra-red spectroscopy (RAIRS) and contact mode AFM. It is observed that the work of adhesion is independent of thiol chain length though the standard deviation is high for short chain length thiol-based monolayers. This may be attributed to the relatively more deformable nature of the short chain thiol films due to their heterogeneity in the monolayer structure than the long chain ones. This, in turn, increases the contact area/volume between the AFM tip and the monolayer, and hence the force of adhesion. However, in the presence of water, the force of adhesion is lower than that observed in air reflecting the effects of capillary forces/polar components associated with the surface energy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The hydration structure and translocation of an excess proton in hydrogen bonded water clusters of two different sizes are investigated by means of finite temperature quantum simulations. The simulations are performed by employing the method of Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics where the forces on the nuclei are obtained directly from `on the fly' quantum electronic structure calculations. Since no predefined interaction potentials are used in this scheme, it is ideally suited to study proton translocation processes which proceed through breaking and formation of chemical bonds. The coordination number of the hydrated proton and the index of oxygen to which the excess proton is attached are calculated along the simulation trajectories for both the clusters.</p>

				<title>Optically-driven red blood cell rotor in linearly polarized laser tweezers</title>

				<page>0777-0786</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have constructed a dual trap optical tweezers set-up around an inverted microscope where both the traps can be independently controlled and manipulated in all the three dimensions. Here we report our observations on rotation of red blood cells (RBCs) in a linearly polarized optical trap. Red blood cells deform and become twisted in hypertonic phosphate buffer saline and when trapped, experience an unbalanced radiation pressure force. The torque generated from the unbalanced force causes the trapped RBC to rotate. Addition of Ca$^{++}$ ions in the solution, keeping the osmolarity same, makes the cell membranes stiffer and the cells deform less. Thus the speed of rotation of the red blood cells can be controlled, as less deformation and in turn less asymmetry in shape produces less torque under the radiation pressure resulting in slower rotation at the same laser power.</p>

					<p>Nearly monodispersed particles of silica were prepared and coated with uniform layers of titanium dioxide in anatase phase by hydrolysis and condensation of titanium butoxide. The coating thickness could be altered by adjusting the concentration of reactants (titanium butoxide and water) and the amount of added silica particles. Different coating thicknesses were deposited and studied using optical absorption spectroscopy, electron microscopy and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. It was found that silica particles of size $170 \pm 5$ nm were coated with $23 \pm 5$ nm thick layer of titanium dioxide. Alternatively titania particles of size $340 \pm 5$ nm were synthesized by controlled hydrolysis of titanium ethoxide in the presence of sodium chloride. These particles were further coated with $135 \pm 5$ nm thick layer of silica to investigate changes in properties after changing the shell material.</p>

				<page>0793-0799</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Silver tungstate (Ag$_{2}$WO$_{4}$) nanoparticles in two different morphologies are prepared by controlling the reaction kinetics of aqueous precipitation. X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the silver tungstate nanoparticles are in the $\alpha$-phase. SEM images show the rod-like and fiber-like morphologies of the nanoparticles with high aspect ratios. The TGA and DTA studies show the high thermal stability of the nanorods. The average crystallite sizes (20–30 nm) of the rod-like silver tungstate estimated from TEM is consistent with the XRD results.</p>

				<page>0801-0807</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>II–VI semiconductor nanoparticles are presently of great interest for their practical applications such as zero-dimensional quantum confined materials and for their applications in optoelectronics and photonics. The optical properties get modified dramatically due to the confinement of charge carriers within the nanoparticles. Similar to the effects of charge carriers on optical properties, confinement of optical and acoustic phonons leads to interesting changes in the phonon spectra. In the present work, we have synthesized nanoparticles of CdS using chemical precipitation technique. The crystal structure and grain size of the particles are studied using XRD. The UV–visible absorption, photoluminescence and Raman spectra of the sample are recorded and discussed briefly.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowhiskers have been prepared using a multilayer ZnO(50 nm)/Zn(20 nm)/ZnO(2 $\mu$m) structure on a polished stainless steel (SS) substrate by high rate magnetron sputtering. The formation of uniformly distributed ZnO nanowhiskers with about 20 nm dia. and 2 to 5 $\mu$m length was observed after a post-deposition annealing of the prepared structure at $300–400^{\circ}$ C. An array of highly $c$-axis oriented ZnO columns (70–300 nm in dia. and up to 10 $\mu$m long) were grown on Si substrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at a high pressure (1 Torr), and Raman studies showed the activation of surface phonon modes. The nanosized powder (15–20 nm) and nanoparticle ZnO films on glass substrate were also prepared by a chemical route. Nanowhiskers showed enhanced UV light detection characteristics, and the chemically prepared ZnO nanoparticle films exhibited good sensing properties for alcohol.</p>

				<page>0815-0819</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aqueous solution containing spherical silver nanoparticles of 20–80 nm size have been generated using a newly developed novel electro-exploding wire (EEW) technique where thin silver wires have been exploded in double distilled water. Structural properties of the resulted nanoparticles have been studied by means of X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The absorption spectrum of the aqueous solution of silver nanoparticles showed the appearance of a broad surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak centered at a wavelength of 390 nm. The theoretically generated SPR peak seems to be in good agreement with the experimental one. Strong green fluorescence emission was observed from the water-suspended silver nanoparticles excited with light of wavelengths 340, 360 and 390 nm. The fluorescence of silver nanoparticles could be due to the excitation of the surface plasmon coherent electronic motion with the small size effect and the surface effect considerations.</p>

				<title>Nanoparticulate platinum films on gold using dendrimer-based wet chemical method</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0821-0830</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is a growing interest in devising wet chemical alternatives for physical deposition methods for applications involving thin films, e.g., catalysis. Deposition of platinum on thin gold films is often a problem leading to incomplete coverage and improper adhesion to solid surfaces. Gold substrates often need pre-activation for achieving complete coverage. We demonstrate here that dendrimers with proper functionalities and size work as well-defined nucleating agents and adhesion promoters. This feature is demonstrated using an amine-terminated dendrimer of generation 4.0. This approach allows one to obtain adherent nanoparticulate films of platinum on gold. Unlike other nucleating agents and adhesion promoting compounds, dendrimers have a well-defined ordered structure in terms of their space filling ability.</p>
					<p>The stability of the films obtained with adsorbed dendrimers is emonstrated using the electrocatalytic reactions of fuels like methanol. The films formed without dendrimers cannot sustain the electro-oxidation currents due to the instability of the films while the films formed with dendrimers can sustain currents for longer duration and for several cycles. The dendrimer-derived Pt films exhibit higher catalytic activity compared to other methods.</p>

				<title>On amorphization and nanocomposite formation in Al–Ni–Ti system by mechanical alloying</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0831-0840</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amorphous structure generated by mechanical alloying (MA) is often used as a precursor for generating nanocomposites through controlled devitrification. The amorphous forming composition range of ternary Al–Ni–Ti system was calculated using the extended Miedema's semi-empirical model. Eleven compositions of this system showing a wide range of negative enthalpy of mixing ($−\Delta H^{\text{mix}}$) and amorphization ($−\Delta H^{\text{amor}}$) of the constituent elements were selected for synthesis by MA. The Al$_{88}$Ni$_{6}$Ti$_{6}$ alloy with relatively small negative $\Delta H^{\text{mix}}$ (−0.4 kJ/mol) and $\Delta H^{\text{amor}}$ (−14.8 kJ/mol) became completely amorphous after 120 h of milling, which is possibly the first report of complete amorphization of an Al-based rare earth element free Al–TM–TM system (TM = transition metal) by MA. The alloys of other compositions selected had much more negative $\Delta H^{\text{mix}}$ and $\Delta H^{\text{amor}}$ ; but they yielded either nanocomposites of partial amorphous and crystalline structure or no amorphous phase at all in the as-milled condition, evidencing a high degree of stability of the intermetallic phases under the MA environment. Hence, the negative $\Delta H^{\text{mix}}$ and $\Delta H^{\text{amor}}$ are not so reliable for predicting the amorphization in the present system by MA.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Starting with Cu$_{0.65}$Zn$_{0.35}$ with an e/a ratio of 1.35 we studied the phase formation in nanophase (Cu$_{0.65}$Zn$_{0.35}$)$_{1−x}$Fe$_{x}$ alloys in the concentration range $0.1 \leq x \leq 0.7$ to see the effect of altering the electron concentration. The evolution of bcc phase from the fcc phase as a function of Fe concentration was investigated by Mössbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The grain size, lattice parameters, and average hyperfine magnetic field distributions were estimated for the nanophase alloys. The fcc phase was observed to persist up to 40 atomic per cent Fe substitutions, a mixed (fcc $+$ bcc) phase region up to 70 atomic per cent Fe and bcc phase beyond 70 atomic per cent Fe. The magnetic state of the alloys changed from nonmagnetic for $x \leq 0.3$ to magnetically ordered state at room temperature for $x \geq 0.33$, which lies in the fcc phase region. The fcc phase alloys of Fe with non-magnetic metals have very low magnetic transition temperatures. However, in this system the room temperature state is unusually magnetic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nanosized iron oxide, a moderately large band-gap semiconductor and an essential component of optoelectrical and magnetic devices, has been prepared successfully inside the restricted internal pores of mesoporous silica material through in-situ reduction during impregnation. The samples were characterized by powder XRD, TEM, SEM/EDS, N$_{2}$ adsorption, FT-IR and UV–visible spectroscopies. Characterization data indicated well-dispersed isolated nanoclusters of (Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$)$_{n}$, within the internal surface of 2D-hexagonal mesoporous silica structure. No occluded Fe/Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ crystallites were observed at the external surface of the mesoporous silica nanocomposites. Inorganic mesoporous host, such as hydrophilic silica in the pore walls, directs a physical constraint necessary to prevent the creation of large Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ agglomerates and enables the formation of nanosized Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ particles inside the mesopore.</p>

				<title>Recent study of nanomaterials prepared by inert gas condensation using ultra high vacuum chamber</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0881-0891</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ultra high vacuum chamber was developed in the Department of Nuclear Physics, University of Madras with the funding from DST, India. This UHV chamber is used to prepare nanocrystalline materials by inert gas condensation technique (IGCT). Nanocrystalline materials such as PbF$_{2}$, Mn$^{2+}$-doped PbF$_{2}$, Sn-doped In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ (ITO), ZnO, Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$, Ag$_{2}$O, CdO, CuO, ZnSe:ZnO etc., were prepared by this technique and characterized. Results of some of these materials will be presented in this paper. In solid-state $^{207}$Pb NMR on PbF$_{2}$ a separate signal due to the presence of grain boundary has been observed. The structural phase transition pressure during the phase transformation from the cubic phase to orthorhombic phase under high pressure shows an increase with the decrease in grain size. Presence of electronic centres in nanocrystalline PbF$_{2}$ is observed from Raman studies and the same has been con¯rmed by photoluminescence studies. Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ was prepared and $^{56}$Fe ions were implanted. After implantation segregation of $^{56}$Fe ions was examined by SEM. The oxidation properties of ITO were studied by HRTEM. As against the expectation of oxide coating on individual nanograins of In{Sn alloy, ITO nanograins grew into faceted nanograins on heat treatment in air and O$_{2}$ atmosphere. The growth of ITO under O$_{2}$ atmosphere showed pentagon symmetry. The PMN was initially prepared by solid-state reaction. Further, this PMN relaxor material will be used to convert into nanocrystalline PMN by IGCT with sputtering and will be studied.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0893-0900</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents some of the important magnetic properties of the nano-structured spinel ferrites such as Ni$_{0.5}$Zn$_0.5}$Fe$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and Mn$_{0.67}$Zn$_{0.33}$Fe$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and also that of the nanocomposite Nd$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B/$\alpha$-Fe permanent magnetic material. The increase in the magnetic transition temperature of Ni-Zn ferrite from 538 K in the bulk state to 592 K when the grain size is reduced to 16 nm is correlated to the enhancement in the AB super-exchange interaction strength because of an increase in the magnetic ion concentration in the A-site on milling, as shown by the EXAFS and in-field Mössbauer studies. The particle size has been tailor-made by varying the concentration of the oxidant in the case of Mn-Zn ferrite. The critical particle size for the superparamagnetic limit has been found to be 25 nm with an effective magnetic anisotropy constant of 7.78 kJ m$^{-3}$ which is about an order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk ferrite. The exchange coupling is found to be strengthened in the nanocomposite magnet Nd$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B/$\alpha$-Fe, when the grain boundary anisotropy is removed by thermal annealing and thus facilitating the enhancement of the energy product.</p>

The role of the rare-earth ion concentration, crystal size and crystal phase on the up- and downconversion emission of rare-earth ions in oxide nanocrystals and their underlying mechanisms are discussed. It is also found that the luminescence lifetime of the excited state rare-earth ions is sensitive to the particle crystalline phase and size. The analysis suggests that the modifications of radiative and nonradiative relaxation mechanisms are due to local symmetry structure of the host lattice and crystal size respectively.</p>

Excited state interactions were investigated by varying the length of the spacer group and the concentration of fluorophore. The flexible long alkyl chain tethering pyrene in {\bf Au-P2/Au-P3} allows free interaction between fluorophores resulting in excimer formation whereas the intermolecular interactions are limited in the {\bf Au-P1} system due to the restriction imposed by the curvature of spherical gold nanoparticle. A gradual increase in the peak intensity ratio of III/I band of the normal fluorescence of pyrene was observed indicating that the surface of nanoparticle is more polar than the bulk solvent (toluene).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In a program on the development of metal (e.g. Au, Ag, Cu and their alloy) nanoparticles in sol{gel derived films, attempts were made to synthesize di®erent coloured coatings on glasses and plastics. The absorption position of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band arising from the embedded metal nanoparticles was tailored by controlling the refractive index of the matrix for the development of di®erent colours. Thus different coloured (pink to blue) coatings on ordinary sheet glasses were prepared by generating Au nanoparticles in mixed SiO$_{2}$-TiO$_{2}$ matrices having refractive index values ranging from about 1.41 to 1.93. In another development, {\textit{in situ}} generation of Ag nanoparticles in the inorganic{organic hybrid host leads to the formation of different abrasion resistant coloured coatings (yellow to pink) on polycarbonate substrates after curing. As expected, the SPR peak of Ag or Au is gradually red-shifted due to the increase of refractive index of the coating matrices causing a systematic change of colour.</p>

				<title>Structural, electrical and gas-sensing properties of In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ : Ag composite nanoparticle layers</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0949-0958</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The central objective of this study is to investigate (i) size-dependent properties of In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ nanoparticles and (ii) the role of metal additives in enhancing the gas sensing response. For this purpose, In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ : Ag composite nanoparticle layers having well-defined individual nanoparticle size and composition have been grown by a two step synthesis method. Thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy have been used to study the effect of post-synthesis heat treatment on the size and structure of the nanoparticles. A first-time unambiguous observation of size-dependent lowering of transformation temperature has been explained in terms of lower cohesive energy of surface atoms and increase in surface-to-volume ratio with decrease in nanoparticle size. The gas sensing studies of In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ as well as the In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ : Ag composite nanoparticle layers have been studied as a function of size and composition. In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ : Ag composite nanoparticle layers with $15\%$ silver show a sensitivity of 436 and response time of 6 s for 1000 ppm of ethanol in air. Ag additives form a p-type Ag$_{2}$O, which interact with n-type In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ to produce an electron-de¯cient space-charge layer. In the presence of ethanol, interfacial Ag$_{2}$O reduces to Ag, creating an accumulation layer in In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ resulting in increased sensitivity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electroless, EL coating technique is one of the elegant ways of coating by controlling the temperature and pH of the coating bath in which there is no usage of electric current. It is estimated that the market for this chemistry will increase at a rate of about $15\%$ per year. Use of microwave energy for synthesis of material with novel microstructures is an exciting new field in material science with enormous application.</p>
					<p>In this investigation, nanograined BaZn$_{2-y}$Co$_{y}$Fe$_{16}$O$_{27}$ ($y = 0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6$ and $2.0$) powders have been synthesized by citrate precursor method followed by heat treatment at various speci¯ed temperatures like 650, 750 and $850^{\circ}$C for 3 h in the furnace. In addition heat treatments are also carried out in the microwave oven of the power rating of 760 W. The powders thus produced have been characterized by SEM, EPMA, VSM, XRD and thermal analysis techniques.</p>
					<p>As a forward step towards EL nano-composite coatings, Ni-P-$X$ ($X$ = BaZn$_{2-y}$ Co$_{y}$Fe$_{16}$O$_{27}$) coatings with thickness less than $\sim 0.1$ mm thick has been produced. Such coating exhibits absorption of microwave in the range of 12{18 GHz up to about 20 db depending upon the volume fraction of the ferrite particles embedded in the Ni-P matrix.</p>

					<p>The present study reports the covalent immobilization of myosin on glass surface and {\textit{in-vitro}} motility of actin-myosin biomolecular motor. Myosin was immobilized on poly-L-lysine coated glass using heterobifunctional cross linker EDC and characterized by AFM. The in-vitro motility of actin was carried out on the immobilized myosin. It was observed that velocity of actin over myosin increases with increasing actin concentration (0.4-1.0 mg/ml) and was found in the range of 0.40-3.25 $\mu$m/s. The motility of actin-myosin motor on artificial surfaces is of immense importance for developing nanodevices for healthcare and engineering applications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple combustion method has been tried for the preparation of nanoparticle-sized LiBiO$_{2}$ powder with urea as the igniter and glycerol as the binding material. Nitrates of Li$^{+}$ and Bi$^{3+}$ were mixed together to form a uniform mixture. Required quantities of urea and glycerol were added to this mixture to form a paste. This paste was carefully heated to $100^{\circ}$C initially and finally heated to $460^{\circ}$C for 5 h. The product obtained was subjected to TG/DTA and XRD analysis. The particle size of the cathode material was roughly calculated from the X-ray data using Scherer equation. However, SEM and EDAX analysis were carried out in detail to con¯rm the particle size and the composition of LiBiO$_{2}$ respectively. A 2016 coin type button cell was assembled with LiBiO$_{2}$ as cathode and graphite as anode containing polypropylene separator and a solution of 1 M LiClO$_{4}$ dissolved in 1:1 (EC$+$DEC) mixture as the electrolyte. Charge/discharge studies were conducted to establish viability of the reversible cell.</p>

				<title>Wigner distributions for finite dimensional quantum systems: An algebraic approach</title>

				<page>0981-0993</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss questions pertaining to the definition of `momentum', `momentum space', `phase space' and `Wigner distributions'; for finite dimensional quantum systems. For such systems, where traditional concepts of `momenta' established for continuum situations offer little help, we propose a physically reasonable and mathematically tangible definition and use it for the purpose of setting up Wigner distributions in a purely algebraic manner. It is found that the point of view adopted here is limited to odd dimensional systems only. The mathematical reasons which force this situation are examined in detail.</p>

				<title>Numerical consistency check between two approaches to radiative corrections for neutrino masses and mixings</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0995-1013</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We briefly outline the two popular approaches on radiative corrections to neutrino masses and mixing angles, and then carry out a detailed numerical analysis for a consistency check between them in MSSM. We find that the two approaches are nearly consistent with a discrepancy factor of $4.2\%$ with running vacuum expectation value (VEV) ($13\%$ for scale-independent VEV) in mass eigenvalues at low-energy scale but the predictions on mixing angles are almost consistent. We check the stability of the three types of neutrino models, i.e., hierarchical, inverted hierarchical and degenerate models, under radiative corrections, using both approaches, and find consistent conclusions. The neutrino mass models which are found to be stable under radiative corrections in MSSM are the normal hierarchical model and the inverted hierarchical model with opposite CP parity. We also carry out numerical analysis on some important conjectures related to radiative corrections in the MSSM, viz., radiative magnification of solar and atmospheric mixings in the case of nearly degenerate model having same CP parity (MPR conjecture) and radiative generation of solar mass scale in exactly two-fold degenerate model with opposite CP parity and non-zero $U_{e3}$ (JM conjecture). We observe certain exceptions to these conjectures. We find a new result that both solar mass scale and $U_{e3}$ can be generated through radiative corrections at low energy scale. Finally the effect of scale-dependent vacuum expectation value in neutrino mass renormalisation is discussed.</p>

We employ here the one-loop order in QED and three-loop order in QCD evolution equations of the fermion mass renormalisation. Our present calculation is found to be new and also reliable when compared to the earlier values employed by various authors.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A relativistic analysis of p $+$ $^{40}$Ca elastic scattering with different nuclear ground state target densities at 135 to 200 MeV is presented in this paper. It is found that the IGO densities are more consistent in reproducing the data over the energy range considered here. The reproduction of spin-rotation-function data with the simultaneous fitting of differential cross-section and analyzing power, and the appearance of wine-bottle-bottom shaped Re $U_{\text{eff}}(r)$ in the transition energy region, sensitively depends on the input nuclear ground state densities and are not solely the relativistic characteristic signatures. We also found that the wine-bottle-bottom shaped Re $U_{\text{eff}}(r)$ is preferred by the spin observables in the transition energy region (i.e. 181 MeV to 200 MeV).</p>

Evolution of the shape with spin, and rotation alignment of proton as well as neutron 0g$_{9/2}$ orbitals is investigated along with the inter- and intra-nucleus variations of the $g$ factors as a function of $J$. We find that the shape of $^{78}$Kr remains prolate all through up to $J = 24$, whereas $^{76}$Kr becomes triaxial beyond $J = 12$.</p>

					<p>Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) with totally depleted transmission type Si surface barrier detector in reverse mount has been investigated to identify fission fragments in the presence of elastic background in heavy ion-induced fission reactions by both numerical simulation and experimental studies. The PSD method is compared with the other conventional methods adopted to identify fission fragments with solid-state detectors such as $\Delta E-E$ telescope and single thin $\Delta E$ detector and the data for the $^{10}$B $+$ $^{232}$Th fission reaction are presented. Results demonstrate the usefulness of a single transmission-type surface barrier detector for the identification of fission fragments and projectiles like heavy ions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Parametric study of optical emission from two successive laser pulses produced chromium and magnesium plasma is presented. The line emission from chromium and magnesium plasma showed an increase by more than six times for double laser pulse excitation than for single-pulse excitation. An optimum increase in emission intensity was noted for inter-pulse delay of $\sim 2–3 \mu$s for all the elements. The experimental observations were qualitatively explained on the basis of absorption of second laser pulse in the pre-formed (by first laser) coronal plasma by inverse Bremsstrahlung process, which were found responsible for the excitation of more ions and atoms in the plasma. This process starts as the plasma scale length becomes greater than the laser wavelength. This study further indicated the suitability of this technique in the field of elemental analysis.</p>

					<p>The static structure factors of liquid alkali metals have been modelled at temperatures close to their melting points and a few higher temperatures using the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method. The positions of 5000 atoms in a box, with full periodicity, were altered until the experimental diffraction data of the structure factor agrees with the associated model structure factor within the errors. The model generated is then analysed.</p>
					<p>The position of the first peak of the pair distribution function $g(r)$ does not show any significant temperature dependence and the mean bond lengths can be approximated within an interval of 3.6–5.3 Å, 4.5–6.6 Å, 4.8–6.7 Å and 5.1–7.3 Å for Na, K, Rb and Cs respectively. The cosine bond distributions show similar trend with the flattening up of the first peak with increase in temperature. In addition, the coordination numbers of these liquid metals are high due to the presence of non-covalent bonding between them. On the average, we surmise that the coordination number decreases with increase in temperature.</p>

				<page>1097-1108</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dynamic and static light scattering experiments have been performed at various molar ratios $(\mu)$ of water to AOT and temperatures on water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsions dispersed in n-heptane, n-octane, and n-nonane. Size and shape fluctuations of microemulsion droplets are determined with very high precision because polydispersity influences the characteristic features of scattering data as well as the hydrodynamic radius with $\mu$. Self-consistent interpretation of dynamic and static light scattering data using optical properties and packing consideration on the basis of the layered sphere model are obtained. The estimated extent of polydispersity index of $17\%$ is found, whereas the polydispersity is independent of the alkane types. The geometrical parameters, e.g., hydrodynamic radius, area per head group of the surfactant molecule and thickness of the surfactant layer of microemulsion droplets are also estimated and compared in three different $n$-alkane types. The best interpretation of the temperature dependence of data has shown a transition from spherical droplets to ellipsoid aggregates with increasing temperature. Axial ratio increases with increase of temperature and the longer the alkane the larger is the axial ratio. The parameters describing the polydispersity and shape change are in agreement with theoretical and experimental results found in the literature.</p>

					<p>A new type of discrete VLF emissions recorded at the low-latitude ground station Varanasi (geomag. lat. $14^{\circ}55'$ N, geomag. long. $154^{\circ}$E; $L = 1.07$) during the strong magnetic activity on 29–30 April 1990 have been reported. A generation mechanism for various temporal and spectral features of discrete VLF emissions recorded at Varanasi is presented on the basis of cyclotron resonance interaction between whistler mode wave and energetic electrons ejected by substorm electric fields. An attempt is also made to determine parallel energy and wave growth relevant to the generation process of discrete VLF emissions. Finally, our results are discussed with other published works.</p>

X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the prepared compound was very fine (10–25 nm), homogeneous and of rhombohedral symmetry. The apparent density of samples decreased with the P$^{5+}$ additions. Studies of dielectric constant and dielectric loss as a function of frequency (10–1000 kHz) and temperature suggest that the compound undergoes diffuse type of phase transition without any sign of relaxor behaviour. With increasing $x$, dielectric constant was found to decrease appreciably, whereas Curie temperature ($T_{C}$) was found to increase.</p>

				<page>0003-0030</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rotating dilute Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of alkali atoms offer a testing ground for theories of vortices in weakly interacting superfluids. In a rotating superfluid, quantised vortices, with a vorticity h/m, form above a critical velocity. Such vortices have been generated in BEC of alkali atoms by different techniques such as (a) wave function engineering of a two-component BEC, (b) decay of solitons, (c) rotation of a thermal cloud before cooling it below the condensation temperature, (d) stirring with an `optical' spoon, (e) rotating a deformation in the anisotropic trap in which the condensate is trapped and (f ) by creating Berry phase by adiabatically reversing the axial magnetic field. Since the core of a vortex is a fraction of a micrometer in diameter, it cannot be directly imaged optically. The condensate with vortices is allowed to ballistically expand till the size increases by one order before the vortices are imaged. Surface wave spectroscopy and the change in aspect ratio of a rotating cloud are the other techniques used.</p>
					<p>Studies have been made on the creation and dynamics of single vortex and on systems with more than a hundred vortices. Results have been obtained on vortex nucleation, stability of vortex structures, nature of the vortex lattice and defects in such a lattice. Important results are: (a) evidence exists that vortex nucleation takes place by a surface mode instability; but this is not the only mechanism; (b) the vortex lattice is perfectly triangular right up to the edge; (c) in the initial stages of rotation of the cloud a tangled web of vortices is seen; it takes a few hundred milliseconds before the vortices arrange themselves in a lattice; this time appears to be independent of temperature; (d) the decay of vortices appears to arise from the transfer of energy to the rotating thermal component and is dependent on temperature; (e) defects in the lattices such as dislocations and grain boundaries are seen; (f) transverse oscillations (Tkachenko modes) of the vortex lattice have been observed; and (g) giant vortices have been produced. These will be discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The collective modes of a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an attractive quadratic plus quartic trap are investigated. Assuming the presence of a large number of vortices we apply the diffused vorticity approach to the system. We then use the sum rule technique for the calculation of collective frequencies, comparing the results with the numerical solution of the linearized hydrodynamic equations. Numerical solutions also show the existence of low-frequency multipole modes which are interpreted as vortex oscillations.</p>

				<title>Melting of heterogeneous vortex matter: The vortex `nanoliquid'</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0043-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Disorder and porosity are parameters that strongly influence the physical behavior of materials, including their mechanical, electrical, magnetic and optical properties. Vortices in superconductors can provide important insight into the effects of disorder because their size is comparable to characteristic sizes of nanofabricated structures. Here we present experimental evidence for a novel form of vortex matter that consists of inter-connected nanodroplets of vortex liquid caged in the pores of a solid vortex structure, like a liquid permeated into a nanoporous solid skeleton. Our nanoporous skeleton is formed by vortices pinned by correlated disorder created by high-energy heavy ion irradiation. By sweeping the applied magnetic field, the number of vortices in the nanodroplets is varied continuously from a few to several hundred. Upon cooling, the caged nanodroplets freeze into ordered nanocrystals through either a first-order or a continuous transition, whereas at high temperatures a uniform liquid phase is formed upon delocalization-induced melt- ing of the solid skeleton. This new vortex nanoliquid displays unique properties and symmetries that are distinct from both solid and liquid phases.</p>

				<page>0055-0065</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We consider the effect of weak uncorrelated quenched disorder (point defects) on a strongly fluctuating flux-line liquid. We use a hydrodynamic model which is based on mapping the flux-line system onto a quantum liquid of {\textit{relativistic}} charged bosons in $2 + 1$ dimensions [P Benetatos and M C Marchetti, {\textit{Phys. Rev.}} {\bf B64}, 054518 (2001)]. In this model, flux lines are allowed to be arbitrarily curved and can even form closed loops. Point defects can be scalar or polar. In the latter case, the direction of their dipole moments can be random or correlated. Within the Gaussian approximation of our hydrodynamic model, we calculate disorder-induced corrections to the correlation functions of the flux-line fields and the elastic moduli of the flux-line liquid. We find that scalar disorder enhances loop nucleation, and polar (magnetic) defects decrease the tilt modulus.</p>

					<p>The properties of the ideal periodic vortex lattice in bulk superconductors and in films of any thickness can be calculated from Ginzburg-Landau theory by an iteration method using Fourier series. The London theory yields general analytic expressions for the magnetic field and energy of arbitrary arrangements of straight or curved vortex lines. The elasticity of the vortex lattice is highly nonlocal. The magnetic response of superconductors of realistic shapes like thin and thick strips and disks or thin rectangular plates or films, containing pinned vortices, can be computed within continuum theory by solving an integral equation. A useful example is a thin square with a central hole and a radial slit, used as superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID).</p>

				<title>Why pinning by surface irregularities can explain the peak effect in transport properties and neutron diffraction results in NbSe$_{2}$ and Bi-2212 crystals?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0083-0097</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The existence of a peak effect in transport properties (a maximum of the critical current as function of magnetic field) is a well-known but still intriguing feature of Type II superconductors such as NbSe$_{2}$ and Bi-2212. Using a model of pinning by surface irregularities in anisotropic superconductors, we have developed a calculation of the critical current which allows estimating quantitatively the critical current in both the high critical current phase and the low critical current phase. The only adjustable parameter of this model is the angle of the vortices at the surface. The agreement between the measurements and the model is really very impressive. In this framework, the anomalous dynamical properties close to the peak e®ect is due to coexistence of two different vortex states with different critical currents. Recent neutron diffraction data in NbSe$_{2}$ crystals in the presence of transport current support this point of view.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0099-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A metastable supercooled homogeneous vortex liquid state exists down to zero fluctuation temperature in systems of mutually repelling objects. The zero-temperature liquid state therefore serves as a (pseudo) `fixed point' controlling the properties of vortex liquid below and even around the melting point. Based on this picture, a quantitative theory of vortex melting and glass transition in Type II superconductors in the framework of Ginzburg-Landau approach is presented. The melting line location is determined and magnetization and specific heat jumps are calculated. The point-like disorder shifts the line downwards and joins the order{disorder transition line. On the other hand, the disorder induces irreversible effects via replica symmetry breaking. The irreversibility line can be calculated within the Gaussian variational method. Therefore, the generic phase diagram contains four phases divided by the irreversibility line and melting line: liquid, solid, vortex glass and Bragg glass. We compare various experimental results with the theoretical formula.</p>

					<p>We show experimental results on magnetic phases of Josephson vortices (JVs) in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{2+y}$, obtained from the JV flow-resistance measurements. Periodic oscillations in the flow-resistance enable us to assign the phase of the long-range 3D ordered state, which was confirmed by the beating effect. We have made preliminary experiments on the doping effect to the JV magnetic phase. The doping effect is rejected not only in the lower boundary of 3D ordered phase, but also in the upper boundary. Above the upper boundary, the flow-resistance shows different behaviours, which may be related to the strength of the interlayer coupling of the JVs along the c-axis, and to the creation/annihilation of pancake vortex/anti-vortex pairs, thermally and magnetically.</p>

					<p>Effects of sample size on the second magnetization peak (SMP) in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCuO$_{8+\delta}$ crystals are observed at low temperatures, above the temperature where the SMP totally disappears. In particular, the onset of the SMP shifts to lower fields as the sample size decreases - a result that could be interpreted as a size effect in the order-disorder vortex matter phase transition. However, local magnetic measurements trace this effect to metastable disordered vortex states, revealing the same order-disorder transition induction in samples of different size.</p>

				<title>Vortex lattice mobility and effective pinning potentials in the peak effect region in YBCO crystals</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0149-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The peak effect (PE) in the critical current density in both low and high temperature superconductors has been the subject of a large amount of experimental and theoretical work in the last few/several years. In the case of YBCO, crucial discussions describing a dynamic or a static picture are not settled. In that region of field and temperature the mobility of the vortex lattice (VL) is found to be dependent on the dynamical history. Recently we reported evidence that the VL reorganizes and accesses to robust VL configurations (VLCs) with different effective pinning potential wells arising in response to different system histories. One of the keys to understand the nature of the PE is to investigate the VL behavior in the vicinity of the various VLCs in the region of the PE. The stability of these VLCs was investigated and it was found that they have distinct characteristic relaxation times, which may be related to elastic or plastic creep processes. In this paper we review some of these results and propose a scenario to describe the PE in YBCO crystals.</p>

				<title>Effect of pinning and driving force on the metastability effects in weakly pinned superconductors and the determination of spinodal line pertaining to order-disorder transition</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0159-0177</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We explore the effect of varying drive on metastability features exhibited by the vortex matter in single crystals of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$ and CeRu$_{2}$ with varying degree of random pinning. The metastable nature of vortex matter is reflected in the path dependence of the critical current density, which in turn is probed in a contact-less way via AC-susceptibility measurements. The sinusoidal AC magnetic field applied during AC susceptibility measurements appears to generate a driving force on the vortex matter. In a nascent pinned single crystal of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$, where the peak effect (PE) pertaining to the order-disorder phenomenon is a sharp first-order-like transition, the supercooling feature below the peak temperature is easily wiped out by the reorganization caused by the AC driving force. In this paper, we elucidate the interplay between the drive and the pinning which can conspire to make the path-dependent AC-susceptibility response of different metastable vortex states appear identical. An optimal balance between the pinning and driving force is needed to view the metastability effects in typically weakly pinned specimen of low temperature superconductors. As one uses samples with larger pinning in order to differentiate the response of different metastable vortex states, one encounters a new phenomenon, viz., the second magnetization peak (SMP) anomaly prior to the PE. Supercooling/superheating can occur across both the PE and the SMP anomalies and both of these are known to display non-linear characteristics as well. Interplay between the path dependence in the critical current density and the non-linearity in the electromagnetic response determine the metastability effects seen in the first and the third harmonic response of the AC susceptibility across the temperature regions of the SMP and the PE. The limiting temperature above which metastability effects cease can be conveniently located in the third harmonic data, and the observed behavior can be rationalized within the Bean's critical state model. A vortex phase diagram showing different vortex phases for a typically weakly pinned specimen has been constructed via the AC susceptibility data in a crystal of 2H-NbSe2 which shows the SMP and the PE anomalies. The phase space of coexisting weaker and stronger pinned regions has been identified. It can be bifurcated into two parts, where the order and disorder dominate, respectively. The former part continuously connects to the reentrant disordered vortex phase pertaining to the small bundle pinning regime, where the vortices are far apart, interaction effects are weak and the polycrystalline form of flux line lattice prevails.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>New experimental data are presented on the scan rate dependence of the magnetization hysteresis width $\Delta M(H)$ ($\propto$ critical current density $J_{c}(H)$) in isothermal $M-H$ scans in a weakly pinned single crystal of Ca$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$, which displays second magnetization peak (SMP) anomaly as distinct from the peak effect (PE). We observe an interesting modulation in the field dependence of a parameter which purports to measure the dynamical annealing of the disordered bundles of vortices injected through the sample edges towards the destined equilibrium vortex state at a given $H$. These data, in conjunction with the earlier observations made while studying the thermomagnetic history dependence in $J_{c}(H)$ in the tracing of the minor hysteresis loops, imply that the partially disordered state heals towards the more ordered state between the peak field of the SMP anomaly and the onset field of the PE. The vortex phase diagram in the given crystal of Ca$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$ has been updated in the context of the notion of the phase coexistence of the ordered and disordered regions between the onset field of the SMP anomaly and the spinodal line located just prior to the irreversibility line. A multi-critical point and a critical point in the $(H, T)$ region of the Bragg glass phase have been marked in this phase diagram and the observed behavior is discussed in the light of recent data on multi-critical point in the vortex phase diagram in a single crystal of Nb.</p>

					<p>Thermodynamically stable vortex-antivortex structures in a quasi-two-dimensional superconductor in a tilted magnetic field are predicted. For this geometry, both orbital and spin pair-breaking effects exist, with their relative strength depending on the tilt angle $\mu$. The spectrum of possible states contains the ordinary vortex state (for large $\mu$) and the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state (for $\theta = 0$) as limits. The quasi-classical equations are solved near $H_{c2}$ for arbitrary $\theta$ and it is shown that stable states with co-existing vortices and antivortices exist in a small interval close to $\theta = 0$. The results are compared with recent predictions of antivortices in mesoscopic samples.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In cuprates, in a view where pairing correlations set in at the pseudogap energy scale $T^{\star}$ and acquire global coherence at a lower temperature $T_{c}$, the region $T_{c} \leq T \leq T^{\star}$ is a vast fluctuation regime. $T_{c}$ and $T^{\star}$ vary differently with doping and the question remains about the doping trends of the relevant magnetic field scales: the field $H_{c2}$ bounding the superconducting response and the pseudogap closing field $H_{\text{pg}}. In-plane thermal (Nernst) and our interlayer (tunneling) transport experiments in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+y}$ report hugely different limiting magnetic fields. Here, based on pairing (and the uncertainty principle) combined with the definitions of the Zeeman energy and the magnetic length, we show that both fields convert to the same pseudogap scale $T^{\star}$ upon transformation as orbital and Zeeman critical fields, respectively. The region of superconducting coherence is confined to the `dome' that coincides with the usual unique upper critical field $H_{c2}$ on the strongly overdoped side. We argue that the distinctly different orbital and the Zeeman limiting fields can co-exist owing to charge and spin degrees of freedom separated to different parts of the strongly anisotropic Fermi surface.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present specific heat and thermal conductivity of the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_{5}$ in the vicinity of the superconducting critical field $H_{c2}$, measured with magnetic field in the plane of this quasi-2D compound and at temperatures down to 50 mK. The superconducting phase diagram and the first order nature of the superconducting phase transition at high fields close to a critical field $H_{c2}$ indicate the importance of the Pauli limiting effect in CeCoIn$_{5}$. In the same range of magnetic field we observe a second specific heat anomaly within the superconducting state, and interpret it as a signature of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) inhomogeneous superconducting state. In addition, the thermal conductivity data as a function of field display a kink at a field $H_{k}$ below the superconducting critical field, which closely coincides with the low temperature anomaly in specific heat tentatively identified with the appearance of the FFLO superconducting state. The enhancement of thermal conductivity within the FFLO state calls for further theoretical investigations of the real space structure of the order parameter (and in particular, the structure of vortices) and of the thermal transport within the inhomogeneous FFLO state.</p>

				<page>0239-0246</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recently discovered heavy fermion compounds, quasi-two-dimensional CeCoIn$_{5}$ and skutterudite PrOs$_{4}$Sb$_{12}$, multiple superconducting phases with different symmetries manifest themselves below $T_{c}$. The angle-resolved magnetothermal transport measurements revealed that in PrOs$_{4}$Sb$_{12}$ a novel change in the symmetry of the superconducting gap function occurs deep inside the superconducting state. The ultrasound velocity measurements revealed that in CeCoIn$_{5}$ the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO) phase, in which the order parameter is spatially modulated and has planar nodes aligned perpendicular to the vortices, appears at low temperature and high field. These results open up a new realm for the study of the superconductivity with multiple phases.</p>

					<p>The Ru$_{0.9}$Sr$_{2}$YCu$_{2.1}$O$_{7.9}$ compound synthesized by HPHT (high pressure high temperature) solid-state reaction route exhibits bulk superconductivity below 30 K. Also the Ru-spins are ordered magnetically above 143 K, with a ferromagnetic component at 5 K. Low field (&#60; 1000 Oe) $M$ vs. $H$ plots show that both the superconducting and ferromagnetic components are present in the compound at 5 K. At low temperatures, the compound though remains in spontaneous vortex phase, its $M$ vs. $H$ hysteresis loop is symmetric instead of the theoretically expected asymmetric one. Our results cast doubts on either theoretical model or the intrinsic nature of ferromagnetic superconductivity in studied ruthenate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In contact with a superconductor, the Andreev reflection of the electronslocally modifies the N metal electronic properties, including the local density of states(LDOS). We investigated the LDOS in superconductor–normal metal (Nb–Au) bilayersusing a very low temperature (60 mK) STM on the normal metal side. High resolutiontunneling spectra measured on the Au surface show a clear proximity effect with an energygap of reduced amplitude compared to the bulk Nb gap. The dependence of this mini-gap width with the normal metal thickness is discussed in terms of the Thouless energy. Within the mini-gap, the density of states does not reach zero and shows clear sub-gapfeatures. We compare the experimental spectra with the well-established quasi-classicaltheory.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0261-0269</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We find the unusual vortex dynamics in the low-temperature liquid phase of amorphous Mo$_{x}$Si$_{1−x}$ films by measuring the fluctuating component of the flux-flow voltage $\delta V(t)$ about the average voltage. For the thick film, in which the quantum-vortexliquid (QVL) phase has been well-determined in the field–temperature plane, $\delta V(t)$ originating from the vortex motion is clearly visible in the QVL phase, where the distribution of $\delta V(t)$ is anomalously asymmetric, implying large velocity and/or number fluctuations of driven vortices. For the thin film, in which the QVL phase has not been determined from the static transport measurements, similar unusual vortex motion is observed in nearly the same reduced-temperature regime. We suggest that vortex dynamics in the low-temperature liquid phase of thick and thin films is dominated by common physical mechanisms related to quantum-fluctuation effects.</p>

					<p>We have investigated the vortex dynamics for the `ratchet' operation in a niobium superconductor via a direct imaging of Lorentz microscopy. We directly observe one-directional selective motion of field-gradient-driven vortices along fabricated channels. This results from the rectification of vortices in a spatially asymmetric potential under the oscillating magnetic field in a temporally symmetric manner. Based on the observation of the individual motion of vortices, we clarify the elementary process involved in this rectification.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Vortex and pseudogap states in electron-doped Sm$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ $(x \sim 0.14)$ are investigated by the interlayer transport in magnetic fields up to 45 T. To extract intrinsic properties, we fabricated small 30 nm-high mesa structures, sufficiently thin to be free of the recently reported partial decomposition problems. On cooling, the $c$-axis resistivity $\rho_{c}$ of the mesa structures reveals a semiconductive upturn above $T_{c}$, followed by a sharp superconducting transition at 20 K. When the magnetic field $H$ is applied along the $c$-axis, $\rho_{c}(T)$ shows a parallel shift without significant broadening, as also observed in the hole-doped underdoped cuprates. Above the transition we observe negative magnetoresistance (MR), which can be attributed to the field suppression of the pseudogap, whose magnitude is as small as 38 K. Our results in the $x \sim 0.14$ samples closely correspond to the interlayer transport behavior in the `overdoped' regime of hole-doped Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+y}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We establish a new algorithm that generates a new solution to the Einstein field equations, with an anisotropic matter distribution, from a seed isotropic solution. The new solution is expressed in terms of integrals of an isotropic gravitational potential; and the integration can be completed exactly for particular isotropic seed metrics. A good feature of our approach is that the anisotropic solutions necessarily have an isotropic limit. We find two examples of anisotropic solutions which generalise the isothermal sphere and the Schwarzschild interior sphere. Both examples are expressed in closed form involving elementary functions only.</p>

					<p>The familiar trace identity associated with the scale transformation $x^{\mu} \rightarrow x^{'\mu} = e^{-\lambda} x^{\mu}$ on the Lagrangian density for a noninteracting massive real scalar field in $2 + 1$ dimensions is shown to be violated on a single plate on which the Dirichlet boundary condition $\phi (t, x^{1}, x^{2} = -a) = 0$ is imposed. It is however respected in: (i) $1 + 1$ dimensions in both free space and on a single plate on which the Dirichlet boundary condition $\phi(t, x^{1} = -a) = 0$ holds and (ii) in $2 + 1$ dimensions in free space, i.e. the unconstrained con¯guration. On the plate where $\phi(t, x^{1}, x^{2} = -a) = 0$, the modified trace identity is shown to be anomalous with a numerical coe±cient for the anomalous term equal to the canonical scale dimension, viz.$\dfrac{1}{2}$.The technique of Bordag {\textit{et al}} [{\textit{Ann.

				<title>Discriminating neutrino mass models using Type-II see-saw formula</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0361-0375</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An attempt has been made to discriminate theoretically the three possible patterns of neutrino mass models,viz., degenerate, inverted hierarchical and normal hierachical models, within the framework of Type-II see-saw formula. From detailed numerical analysis we are able to arrive at a conclusion that the inverted hierarchical model with the same CP phase (referred to as Type [IIA]), appears to be most favourable to survive in nature (and hence most stable), with the normal hierarchical model (Type [III]) and inverted hierarchical model with opposite CP phase (Type [IIB]), follow next. The degenerate models (Types [IA,IB,IC]) are found to be most unstable. The neutrino mass matrices which are obtained using the usual canonical see-saw formula (Type I), and which also give almost good predictions of neutrino masses and mixings consistent with the latest neutrino oscillation data, are re-examined in the presence of the left-handed Higgs triplet within the framework of non-canonical see-saw formula (Type II). We then estimate a parameter (the so-called discriminator) which may represent the minimum degree of suppression of the extra term arising from the presence of left-handed Higgs triplet, so as to restore the good predictions on neutrino masses and mixings already acquired in Type-I see-saw model. The neutrino mass model is said to be favourable and hence stable when its canonical see-saw term dominates over the non-canonical (perturbative) term, and this condition is used here as a criterion for discriminating neutrino mass models.</p>

				<title>On diquark clustering in quark-gluon plasma</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0377-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The possibility that pairs of quarks will form diquark clusters in the regime above deconfinement transition for hadron matter at finite density is revisited. Here we present the results on the diquark-diquark (dq-dq) interaction in the framework of constituent quark model taking account of spin, isospin and color degrees of freedom in the spirit of generalized Pauli principle. By constructing the appropriate spin and color states of the dq-dq clusters we compute the expectation values of the interaction Hamiltonian involving pairwise quark-quark interaction. We find that the effective interaction between two diquark clusters is quite sensitive to different configurations characterized by color and spin states, obtained after the coupling of two diquark states. The value of the coupling parameter for a particular color-spin state, i.e., $\{\bar{3}, 1\}$ is compared to the one obtained earlier by Donoghue and Sateesh, {\textit{Phys. Rev.}} {\bf D38}, 360 (1988) based on the effective $\phi^{4}$-theory. This new value of $\lambda$ derived for different color-spin dq-dq states, may lead to several important implications in the studies of diquark star and diquark gas.</p>

A complex (optical) energy-dependent interaction potential is used to derive total inelastic cross-sections resulting from ionization as well as excitation processes. The inelastic cross-sections are bifurcated into discrete and continuum contributions and total ionization cross-sections have been deduced therefrom. Our calculation also provides information, hitherto sparse, on the excitation processes in the atomic targets O, Al, Cu and metal oxides AlO, Al$_{2}$O.

					<p>To improve the Coulomb-Born approximation (CBA) theory of ionization in positronium (Ps) and atom scattering, the effect of exchange is introduced. The nine-dimensional exchange amplitude for ionization of Ps in Ps-H scattering is reduced to a two-dimensional integral using the present Coulomb-Born-Oppenheimer approximation (CBOA). The methodology is extremely useful to evaluate ionization parameters for different target systems and for different types of ionization processes. It is then applied to evaluate the Ps-ionization cross-section and to estimate the effect of exchange on Ps-ionization in Ps-H system. We establish the importance of exchange at lower energy region.</p>

The excess isentropic compressibilities and the excess speed of the sound have been calculated from experimental densities and speed of sound. These excess properties of the binary mixtures were fitted to Redlich-Kister equation, while the Cibulka's equation was used to fit the values related to the values to the ternary system. These excess properties have been used to discuss the presence of significant interactions between the component molecules in the binary mixtures and also the ternary mixtures.</p>
					<p>Speed of sound of the binary mixtures and the ternary mixture have been compared with calculated values from free length theory (FLT), collision factor theory (CFT), Nomoto's relation (NR), Van Deal's ideal mixing relation (IMR) and Junjie's relation (JR).

Using the new analytic wave function of electron miniband conduction of superlattice and a reformulation slab model for the confined LO-phonon modes, an expression for the electron-confined LO-phonon scattering time is obtained. In solving numerically a partial differential equation for the phonon generation rate, our results show that for $x = 0.45$, the LO-phonon in superlattice changes from a bulk-like propagating mode to a confined mode.

				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0473-0478</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optical phase-conjugation (OPC) has been demonstrated in erioglaucine (acid blue 9) dye-doped gelatin films via continuous-wave degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM) using a low-power He-Ne laser at 633 nm. DFWM and holographic processes are found to contribute to the observed phase-conjugate signal. A maximum phase-conjugate beam reflectivity of about $0.24\%$ has been observed in these dye-doped gelatin films.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In a recent paper (Tran {\textit{et al, Ann. Phys.}} {\bf 311}, 204 (2004)), some asymptotic number theoretical results on the partitioning of an integer were derived exploiting its connection to the quantum density of states of a many-particle system. We generalise these results to obtain an asymptotic formula for the {\textit{restricted or coloured}} partitions $p_{k}^{x} (n)$, which is the number of partitions of an integer $n$ into the summand of $s$th powers of integers such that each power of a given integer may occur utmost $k$ times. While the method is not rigorous, it reproduces the well-known asymptotic results for $s = 1$ apart from yielding more general results for arbitrary values of $s$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Elastic scattering of 800 MeV/c pions by $^{12}$C has been studied in the diffraction model with a view to determine pion optical potential by the method of inversion. Finding an earlier diffraction model analysis to be deficient in some respects, we propose a Glauber model based parametrization for the elastic $S$-matrix and show that it provides an exceedingly good fit to the pion-carbon data. The proposed elastic $S$-matrix gives a closed expression for the pion-$^{12}$C optical potential by the method of inversion in the high energy approximation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, the inhomogeneous equation of heat conduction was exactly solved by applying inhomogeneous boundary conditions for laser crystals of aspect ratio=1 (aspect ratio=radius of the laser rod/length of the laser rod). We have shown that the paraxial ray approximation leads the solution to be a function of $r^{2}$, that is, the approximation is equivalent to a situation in which a homogeneous pump source is used. The solution was then used to derive expressions for the overall phase shift, focal length of the thermal lens and the end effect induced curvature of the end face. The expressions were then applied to Nd:YAG laser medium. The result shows a meaningful correction of the order of 0.001 cm to the focal length of Nd:YAG rod for 3 W source power and beam waist of 100 $\mu$m.</p>

				<title>Gain-clamping techniques in two-stage double-pass L-band EDFA</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0539-0545</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two designs of long-wavelength band erbium-doped fiber amplifier (L-band EDFA) for gain clamping in double-pass systems are demonstrated and compared. The first design is based on ring laser technique where a backward amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from the second stage is routed into the feedback loop to create an oscillating laser for gain clamping. The gain is clamped at 18.6 dB from $-40$ to $-8$ dBm with a gain variation of less than $\pm 0.1$ dB and a noise figure of less than 6 dB. Another scheme is based on partial reflection of ASE into the EDFA, which is demonstrated using a narrowband fiber Bragg grating. This scheme achieves a good gain clamping characteristic up to $-12$ dBm of input signal power with a gain variation of less than $\pm 0.3$ dB from a clamped gain of 22 dB. The noise figure of a 1580 nm signal is maintained below 5 dB in this amplifier since this scheme is not based on lasing mechanism. The latter scheme is also expected to be free from the relaxation oscillation problem.</p>

					<p>A theoretical study is made on the generation mechanism of ion acoustics wave in the presence of lower hybrid wave turbulence field in inhomogeneous plasma on the basis of plasma-maser interaction. The lower hybrid wave turbulence field is taken as the low-frequency turbulence field. The growth rate of test high frequency ion acoustics wave is obtained with the involvement of spatial density gradient parameter. A comparative study of the role of density gradient for the generation of ion acoustics wave on the basis of plasma-maser effect is presented.

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0563-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Adhesion of zein to solid substrates has been studied using surface energy profiles as indices and by adhesion mapping using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Different plasticizers like glycerol and sorbitol have been used to form mixed films with zein and properties of these films are studied using surface energy profiles. Comparison of the results from the different mixed samples with those from the pure zein films showed that force mapping could identify areas rich in protein. The adhesion maps produced were deconvoluted from sample topography and contrasted with the data obtained from contact angle measurements. A comparison of the two methods shows that the extent of contact angle hysteresis is indicative of both hydrophobicity of the surface as well as the force of adhesion. Mechanical properties and microstructure of zein films prepared by casting from solutions and using Langmuir-Blodgett film technique have been investigated. Pure zein seemed brittle and exhibited an essentially linear relationship between stress and strain. Films with plasticizer were tougher than these films. In general, mixed films showed better mechanical properties than pure films and had higher ultimate tensile strength and increased per cent elongation. Further, the mixed films of zein showed a higher force of adhesion compared to the pure films.</p>

				<page>0575-0588</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is shown that it is possible to bosonize fermions in any number of dimensions using the hydrodynamic variables, namely the velocity potential and density. The slow part of the Fermi field is defined irrespective of dimensionality and the commutators of this field with currents and densities are exponentiated using the velocity potential as conjugate to the density. An action in terms of these canonical bosonic variables is proposed that reproduces the correct current and density correlations. This formalism in one dimension is shown to be equivalent to the Tomonaga-Luttinger approach as it leads to the same propagator and exponents. We compute the one-particle properties of a spinless homogeneous Fermi system in two spatial dimensions with long-range gauge interactions and highlight the metal-insulator transition in the system. A general formula for the generating function of density correlations is derived that is valid beyond the random phase approximation. Finally, we write down a formula for the annihilation operator in momentum space directly in terms of number conserving products of Fermi fields.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The exact formula of $T_{c}$'s equation and the isotope effect exponent of two-band s-wave superconductors in the weak-coupling limit are derived by considering the influence of interband interaction. In each band, our model consists of two pairing interactions: the electron-phonon interaction and non-electron-phonon interaction. We find that the isotope effect exponent of MgB$_{2}$, $\alpha = 0.3$ with $T_{c} \approx 40$ K can be found in the weak coupling regime and interband interaction of electron-phonon shows more effect on the isotope effect exponent than on the interband interaction of non-phonon.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We review the current status of the exotic pentaquark baryons. After a brief look at experiments of both positive and negative results, we discuss theoretical methods to study the structure and reactions for the pentaquarks. First we introduce the quark model and the chiral soliton model, where we discuss the relation of mass spectrum and parity with some emphasis on the role of chiral symmetry. It is always useful to picture the structure of the pentaquarks in terms of quarks. As for other methods, we discuss a model-independent method, and briefly mention the results from the lattice and QCD sum rule. Decay properties are then studied in some detail, which is one of the important properties of $\Theta^{+}$. We investigate the relation between the decay width and the quark structure having certain spin-parity quantum numbers. Through these analyses, we consider as plausible quantum numbers of $\Theta^{+}, J^{P} = 3/2^{-}$. In the last part of this note, we discuss production reactions of $\Theta^{+}$ which provide links between the theoretical models and experimental information. We discuss photoproductions and hadron-induced reactions which are useful to explore the nature of $\Theta^{+}$.</p>

					<p>Recent experiments indicate that a narrow baryonic state having strangeness $+1$ and mass of about 1540 MeV may be existing. Such a state was predicted in chiral model by Diakonov {\textit{et al}}. In this work I compute the mass and width of this state in chiral color dielectric model. I show that the computed width is about 30 MeV. I find that the mass of the state can be fitted to the experimentally observed mass by invoking a color neutral vector field and its interaction with the quarks.</p>

We obtain the range of predictions in this model by exploring the allowed range of model parameters. We further give a handy parametrisation of these results which incidentally spans the range of various other available predictions at the LHC as well.</p>

					<p>In these lectures I make an introduction to chiral unitary theory applied to the meson-baryon interaction and show how several well-known resonances are dynamically generated, and others are predicted. Two very recent experiments are analyzed, one of them showing the existence of two $\Lambda (1405)$ states and the other one providing support for the $\Lambda (1520)$ resonance as a quasi-bound state of $\sum (1385) \pi$. The use of chiral Lagrangians to account for the hadronic interaction at the elementary level introduces a new approach to deal with the modi¯cation of meson and baryon properties in a nuclear medium. Examples of it for $\bar{K}, \eta$ and $\phi$ modification in the nuclear medium are presented.</p>

				<title>Hadron production near threshold</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the DAE–BRNS Workshop on Hadron Physics – Part I</feature>
				<page>0753-0764</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Final state interaction e®ects in $pp \rightarrow p\Lambda K^{+}$ and $pd \rightarrow ^{3}He \eta$ reactions are explored near threshold to study the sensitivity of the cross-sections to the $p\Lambda$ potential and the $\eta N$ scattering matrix. The final state scattering wave functions between $\Lambda$ and $p$ and $\eta$ and $^{3}$He are described rigorously. The $\Lambda$ production is described by the exchange of one pion and a $K$-meson between two protons in the incident channel. The $\eta$ production is described by a two-step model, where in the first step a pion is produced. This pion then produces an $\eta$ by interacting with another nucleon.</p>

				<feature>Proceedings of the DAE–BRNS Workshop on Hadron Physics – Part I</feature>
				<page>0865-0780</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the investigation of the strange meson production in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton–nucleus ($pA$) reactions within an effective Lagrangian model. The kaon production proceeds mainly via excitations of $N^{∗} (1650)$, $N^{∗}(1710)$, and $N^{∗}(1720)$ resonant intermediate nucleonic states, in the collision of two initial state nucleons. Therefore, the strangeness production is expected to provide information about the resonances lying at higher excitation energies. For beam energies very close to the kaon production threshold the hyperon–proton final state interaction effects are quite important. Thus, these studies provide a check on the models of hyperon–nucleon interactions. The in medium production of kaons shows strong sensitivity to the self-energies of the intermediate mesons.</p>

					<p>One consequence of the chiral restoration is the mixing of parity partners. We look for a possible signature of the mixing of vector and axial vector mesons in heavy-ion collisions. We suggest an experimental method for its observation. The dynamical evolution of the heavy-ion collision is described by a transport equation of QMD-type evolving nucleons, $N^{∗}$ and $\Delta$ resonances, $\Lambda$’s and $\sum$ baryons, and furthermore, $\pi$’s, $\eta$’s $\rho$’s $\sigma$’s $\omega$’s and kaons with their isospin degrees of freedom. The input cross-sections and resonance parameters of the model are fitted to the available nucleon–nucleon and pion–nucleon cross-sections.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Proton collective flows in heavy-ion collisions from AGS ((2–11) A GeV) to SPS ((40, 158) A GeV) energies are investigated in a nonequilibrium transport model with nuclear mean-field (MF). Sideward $p_{x}$ , directed v 1 , and elliptic $v_{2}$ flows are systematically studied with different assumptions on the nuclear equation of state (EoS). We find that momentum dependence in the nuclear MF is important for understanding the proton collective flows at AGS and SPS energies. Calculated results with momentum-dependent MF qualitatively reproduce the experimental data of proton sideward, directed, and elliptic flows in an incident energy range of (2–158) A GeV.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We analyze the spectra of pions and protons in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies from 2 A GeV to $65+65$ A GeV by using a jet-implemented hadron-string cascade model. In this energy region, hadron transverse mass spectra first show softening until SPS energies, and re-hardening may emerge at RHIC energies. Since hadronic matter is expected to show only softening at higher energy densities, this re-hardening of spectra can be interpreted as a good signature of the quark-gluon plasma formation.</p>

					<p>A new `hidden colour hypothesis' within the framework of QCD, as an extension of and in keeping with the spirit of the `colour singlet hypothesis' is hereby proposed. As such it should play a role in a consistent description of exotic hadrons, such as diquonia, pentaquarks, dibaryons etc. How these exotic hadrons are affected by this new hypothesis is discussed here. This new hypothesis suggests that the experimentalists may not be looking for single exotics but for composites of two or more of the same.</p>

				<title>QCD physics at hadron storage rings: From COSY to FAIR</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the DAE–BRNS Workshop on Hadron Physics – Part II</feature>
				<page>0857-0866</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As a result of the rapid rise of the coupling constant $\alpha_{s}$ at low momentum transfers, perturbation theory is not an appropriate method to describe the strong interaction. In this kinematic regime other methods such as lattice QCD or effective field theories are more appropriate to investigate the appearance of a still unsettled phenomena: confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the confinement of quarks and gluons to hadrons allows crucial tests of fundamental symmetries that are inherent to the QCD Lagrangian but are broken in hadronic systems. Thus, high precision measurements of the production and decay of specific hadronic states provides decisive benchmarks to investigate the properties of QCD in this regime. A new series of experiments are being prepared using nearly full acceptance detectors for neutral and charged particles around internal targets in high intensity, phase-space-cooled hadronic beams. Later this year, it is planned to transfer the WASA detector from the CELSIUS to the COSY ring in order to measure the production and various decay channels of the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons, thereby investigating the violation of P, C, T, and combinations thereof, as well as isospin violation. The experimental and theoretical techniques employed here will provide an important basis to extend these investigations to the static and dynamical properties of hadrons with charm quark content with the high energy storage ring for antiprotons at the new GSI/FAIR facility. Additional related perspectives will be opened at the new facility ranging from the properties of hadrons in dense nuclear matter to measurements of the nucleon's transverse spin distribution in the valence quark region using polarized antiprotons.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Differences in the photoproduction of mesons on the free proton and on nuclei are expected to reveal changes in the properties of hadrons. Inclusive studies of nuclear photoabsorption have provided evidence of medium modifications. However, the results have not been explained in a model independent way. A deeper understanding of the situation is anticipated from a detailed experimental study of meson photoproduction from nuclei in exclusive reactions. In the energy regime above the $\Delta (1232)$ resonance, the dominant double pion production channels are of particular interest. Double pion photoproduction from nuclei is also used to investigate the in-medium modification of meson–meson interactions.</p>

A large acceptance scintillator detector, ENSTAR has been designed and built at BARC, Mumbai and fully assembled and tested at COSY. A test run for calibration and evaluation has been completed. In this contribution we present the design and technical details of the ENSTAR detector and how it will be used to detect protons and pions (the decay products of $\eta$-mesic bound state). The detector is made of plastic scintillators arranged in three concentric cylindrical layers. The readout of the detectors is by means of optical fibres. The layers are used to generate $\Delta E - E$ spectra for particle identification and total energy information of stopped particles. The granularity of the detector allows for position ($\theta$ and $\phi$) determination making the event reconstruction kinematically complete.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Inspite of tremendous interest there has been sporadic searches for dibaryon resonances in the past few decades. The main hurdle one faces in this search is their identification, their signature and practically no guide to their location. With the identification of the pentaquark-$\theta^{+}$ resonance one is encouraged to look for the discovery of strange dibaryons also. However where and how to look for non-strange dibaryons is not clear. The transition from a bipolar to a unipolar non-strange dibaryon may possibly be seen in the $(p, 2p)$ reactions on heavy nuclei. The change of the finite size of the $p-p$ interaction vertex can be identified as a sudden change in the extracted DWIA spectroscopic factor. The DWIA anomalies are to be searched for in the existing $(p, 2p)$ reaction data for the identification of non-strange dibaryons.</p>

Jimbo {\textit{et al}} analysed the complex form of the equations with a rather restricted form of singularity manifold. They did not discuss exact solutions in that context. Here the analysis has been done starting from the real form of the same equations and keeping the singularity manifold completely general in nature. It has been found that the equations, in real form, pass the Painlevé test for integrability. The truncation procedure of the same analysis leads to non-trivial exact solutions obtained previously and auto-Backlund transformation between two pairs of those solutions.</p>

				<title>Effect of entrance channel parameters on the fusion of two heavy ions: Excitation functions of reaction products in $^{16}O + ^{66}Zn$ and $^{37}Cl + ^{45}Sc$ reactions</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0985-0997</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Excitation functions of reaction products formed in $^{16}O + ^{66}Zn$ and $^{37}Cl + ^{45}Sc$ systems, leading to the same compound nucleus, $^{82}Sr$, were measured using recoilcatcher technique and off-line $\gamma$-ray spectrometry. The contribution of non-compound processes like transfer and incomplete fusion (ICF) reactions to the cross-sections of different evaporation residues were delineated by comparing the experimental data with the predictions of Monte Carlo simulation code PACE2. The results show that non-compound processes become a signi¯cant fraction of the total reaction cross-section in $^{16}O + ^{66}Zn$ systems in the beam energy range studied, while $^{37}Cl + ^{45}Sc$ gives mainly compound nucleus products. The mass asymmetry dependence of the fusion and non-compound cross-sections have been analysed in terms of the static fusion model and sum rule model.</p>

					<p>Control of population transfer by rapid adiabatic passage has been an established technique wherein the exact amplitude profile of the shaped pulse is considered to be insignificant.

					<p>Muonium formation in excited states in muon-hydrogen charge-exchange collision is investigated using a method developed in a previous paper. Differential cross-section results are found to resemble positronium formation cross-section results of positron-hydrogen charge-exchange problem. Forward differential and integrated cross-sections are computed for muon energy of 2 keV and higher. Total muonium formation cross-sections are computed using Jackson and Schiff scaling rules.

					<p>In this paper, a novel aperture based on Tolardo concept composed of a central clear disc surrounded by a series of black and white (B/W) concentric annuli of equal transmittance is presented. Di®erent apodized apertures of different number of B/W annuli are suggested in order to improve further the three-dimensional resolving power of confocal imaging systems. Both the axial and lateral point spread functions (PSF) and the corresponding irradiances are computed in both cases of conventional and confocal scanning microscopes for the above-mentioned amplitude filters. These results of axial and lateral irradiances are graphically represented by constructing a computer program using MATLAB. The obtained results are compared with that obtained in case of circular, annular, and Martinez-Corral apodized aperture.</p>

					<p>Ion-acoustic solitons are investigated in the spatially inhomogeneous plasma having electrons-positrons and ions. The soliton characteristics are described by Korteweg-de Vries equation which has an additional term. The density and temperature of different species play an important role for the amplitude and width of the solitons. Numerical calculations show only the possibility of compressive solitons. Further, analytical results predict that the peak amplitude of soliton decreases with the decrease of density gradient. Soliton characteristics like peak amplitude and width are substantially different from those based on KdV theory for homogeneous plasmas.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A study of the electronic structure of the three sulphides, SrS, BaS and PuS has been carried out in this work, using the powder X-ray intensity data from JCPDS powder diffraction data base. The statistical approach, MEM (maximum entropy method) is used for the analysis of the data for the electron density distribution in these materials and an attempt has been made to understand the bonding between the metal atom and the sulphur atom. The mid-bond electron density is found to be maximum for PuS among these three sulphides, being 0.584 e/Å$^{3} at 2.397 Å. SrS is found to have the lowest electron density at the mid-bond (0.003 e/Å$^{3}) at 2.118 Å from the origin leaving it more ionic than the other two sulphides studied in this work. The two-dimensional electron density maps on (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) planes and the one-dimensional profiles along the bonding direction [1 1 1] are used for these analyses. The overall and individual Debye-Waller factors of atoms in these systems have also been studied and analyzed. The refinements of the observed X-ray data were carried out using standard softwares and also a routine written by the author.</p>

				<title>Damage spreading on the 3-12 lattice with competing Glauber and Kawasaki dynamics</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1067-1075</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The damage spreading of the Ising model on the 3-12 lattice with competing Glauber and Kawasaki dynamics is studied. The difference between the two kinds of nearest-neighboring spin interactions (interaction between two 12-gons, or interaction between a 12-gon and a triangle) are considered in the Hamiltonian. It is shown that the ratio of the interaction strength $F$ between the two kinds of interactions plays an important role in determining the critical temperature $T_{d}$ of phase transition from frozen to chaotic. Two methods are used to introduce the bond dilution on the Ising model on the 3-12 lattice: regular and random. The maximum of the average damage spreading $\langle D \rangle_{\text{max}}$ can approach values lower than 0.5 in both cases and the reason can be attributed to the `survivors' among the spins. We have also, for the first time, presented the phase diagram of the mixed G–K dynamics in the 3-12 lattice which shows what happens when going from pure Glauber to pure Kawasaki.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed theoretical study of the low-temperature lattice specific heat of Ni-based dilute alloys has been carried out. Lattice Green's function method has been used to calculate the local density of states of substitutional impurities and lattice specific heat in different alloys. The resonance condition has been investigated for possible occurrence of resonance modes. Except in NiCr and NiMn, low-frequency resonance modes have been obtained in all the alloys. However, no localized mode was obtained. The impurity-induced increase in lattice specific heat is explained on the basis of the obtained resonance modes. The calculation shows an excellent agreement with the measured lattice specific heat in these alloys</p>

					<p>Ni$_{x}$Fe$_{1−x}$ ($0.22 \leq x \leq 0.62$) alloy films were grown by electrodeposition technique. A shift in diffraction peaks of NiFe and Ni$_{3}$Fe was detected with increasing Ni content. The highest positive magnetoresistance ratio was detected as $5\%$ in Ni$_{0.51}$Fe$_{0.49}$.  Positive and negative anisotropic magnetoresistance were observed in longitudinal and transverse geometries respectively. The highest anisotropic magnetoresistance ratio of $9.8\%$ was also detected in Ni$_{0.51}$Fe$_{0.49}$. The angular variation of magnetoresistance was studied. Magnetisation loop curves show that NiFe alloy films have a linear decreasing anisotropy constant with increasing Ni deposit content and show a decreasing behavior of coercivity which indicates soft magnetic property with increasing Ni deposit content.</p>

					<p>Within the framework of quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA), Pyatov–Salamov method $[23]$ for the self-consistent determination of the isovector effective interaction strength parameter, restoring a broken isotopic symmetry for the nuclear part of the Hamiltonian, is used. The isospin admixtures in the ground state of the parent nucleus, and the isospin structure of the isobar analog resonance (IAR) state were investigated with the inclusion of the pairing correlations between nucleons for the medium and heavy mass regions: $80 &#60; A &#60; 90$, $102 &#60; A &#60; 124$, and $204 &#60; A &#60; 214$. It was determined that the influence of the pairing interaction between nucleons on the isospin admixtures in the ground state and the isospin structure of the IAR state is more pronounced for the light isotopes $(N \approx Z)$ of the investigated nuclei.</p>

Numerical calculations of the matrix element are undertaken to produce theoretical data for comparison with the experimental findings. The $A_{2}$ values being $&#62; 0.1$ at photoelectron energies $&#60;20$ keV are certainly higher than $5–8\%$ uncertainties quoted in experimental results.

				<feature>Proceedings of the 50th Annual DAE–BRNS Solid State Physics Symposium</feature>
				<page>0033-0046</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Soft matter, like colloidal suspensions and surfactant gels, exhibit strong response to modest external perturbations. This paper reviews our recent experiments on the nonlinear flow behaviour of surfactant worm-like micellar gels. A rich dynamic behaviour exhibiting regular, quasi-periodic, intermittency and chaos is observed. In particular, we have shown experimentally that the route to chaos is via Type-II intermittency in shear thinning worm-like micellar solution of cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate where the strength of flow-concentration coupling is tuned by the addition of sodium chloride. A Poincaré first return map of the time series and the probability distribution of laminar length between burst events show that our data are consistent with Type-II intermittency. The existence of a `Butterfly' intensity pattern in small angle light scattering (SALS) measurements performed simultaneously with the rheological measurements confirms the coupling of flow to concentration fluctuations in the system under study. The scattered depolarised intensity in SALS, sensitive to orientational order fluctuations, shows the same time-dependence (like intermittency) as that of shear stress.</p>

					<p>We discuss specular reflectivity and off-specular scattering of neutrons and X-rays from magnetic films. Both these techniques are capable of providing information about the morphology of the chemical and magnetic roughness and the magnetic domain structure. The use of neutrons with polarization analysis enables the spatial distribution of different vector components of the magnetization to be determined, and the use of resonant magnetic X-ray scattering enables magnetization in a compound system to be determined element-selectively. Thus both these methods provide powerful and complementary new probes for studying magnetism at the nanoscopic level in a variety of systems such as those exhibiting exchange bias, giant magnetoresistance, spin injection, etc. We shall illustrate with an example of both techniques applied to an exchange bias system consisting of a single crystal of antiferromagnetic FeF$_{2}$ capped with a ferromagnetic Co film, and discuss what has been learned about how exchange bias works in such a system.</p>

				<feature>Proceedings of the 50th Annual DAE–BRNS Solid State Physics Symposium</feature>
				<page>0057-0065</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simple method, based on the proximity effect of electron beam lithography, alleviated by exposing various shapes in the pattern of incident electron exposures with various intensities, was applied to fabricate silicon point-contact devices. The drain current ($I_{d}$) of the device oscillates against gate voltage. The electrical characteristics of the single-electron transistor were observed to be consistent with the expected behavior of electron transport through gated quantum dots, up to 150 K. The dependence of the electrical characteristics on the dot size reveals that the $I_{d}$ oscillation follows from the Coulomb blockade by poly-Si grains in the poly-Si dot. The method of fabrication of this device is completely compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, raising the possibility of manufacturing large-scale integrated nanoelectronic systems.</p>

				<title>Electro-optical characterization and analysis of CuPc-based solar cells with high photovoltage</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the 50th Annual DAE–BRNS Solid State Physics Symposium</feature>
				<page>0067-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Organic solar cells using the CuPc and PTCBI semiconductor layers were studied. A high open circuit voltage of 1.15 V was obtained in a device with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CuPc (15 nm)/PTCBI (7 nm)/Al structure. Results were interpreted in terms of a modified CuPc–Al Schottky diode for the thin PTCBI case and a CuPc–PTCBI heterojunction for the thick PTCBI case. Also, the formation of a thin aluminum oxide layer under the aluminum electrode was postulated. This layer has a beneficial aspect wherein shunting losses are reduced and a high photovoltage is enabled. However, it adds greatly to the series resistance to a point where the short circuit current density is reduced. CuPc Schottky diodes with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CuPc/Al structure yielded a high $V_{oc}$ of 900 mV for a CuPc layer of thickness 140 nm. The $V_{oc}$ increased with increase in CuPc layer thickness.</p>

				<title>What is novel in quantum transport for mesoscopics?</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the 50th Annual DAE–BRNS Solid State Physics Symposium</feature>
				<page>0073-0083</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The understanding of mesoscopic transport has now attained an ultimate simplicity. Indeed, orthodox quantum kinetics would seem to say little about mesoscopics that has not been revealed – nearly effortlessly – by more popular means. Such is far from the case, however. The fact that kinetic theory remains very much in charge is best appreciated through the physics of a quantum point contact. While discretization of its conductance is viewed as the exclusive result of coherent, single-electron-wave transmission, this does not begin to address the paramount feature of all metallic conduction: dissipation. A perfect quantum point contact still has finite resistance, so its ballistic carriers must dissipate the energy gained from the applied field. How do they manage that? The key is in standard many-body quantum theory, and its conservation principles.</p>

				<feature>Proceedings of the 50th Annual DAE–BRNS Solid State Physics Symposium</feature>
				<page>0085-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Highly ordered composite nanowires with multilayer Ni/Cu and NiFe/Cu have been fabricated by pulsed electrodeposition into nanoporous alumina membrane. The diameter of wires can be easily varied by pore size of alumina, ranging from 30 to 100 nm. The applied potential and the duration of each potential square pulse determine the thickness of the metal layers. The nanowires have been characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), magnetic force microscopy (MFM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) measurements. The MFM images indicate that every ferromagnetic layer separated by Cu layer was present as single isolated domain-like magnet. This technique has potential use in the measurement and application of magnetic nanodevices.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Bose–Einstein condensation and superfluidity are well known to occur in the dilute gaseous as well as in the dense liquid state of matter having a fixed number of Bose particles. Very recently, experimental evidence has been obtained for the probable realization of BEC and superfluidity in $^{4}$He in the solid state too, as revealed through its non-classical rotational moment of inertia – smaller than that for the solid. Such a solid that can also subtend a flow as superfluid – and hence a supersolid – is indeed a surprise of condensed matter physics. In this conversation, an order-parameter description for the supersolid state will be given in which the superfluid flow is decoupled from the crystalline density modulation which remains at rest in the laboratory frame, thus giving it a non-classical inertia.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nickel substitution at the cobalt site in Na$_{0.75}$CoO$_{2}$ induces an upturn in the resistivity on lowering the temperature, with the metal-to-insulator transition temperature ($T_{\text{MIT}}$) increasing with the Ni content. Low temperature far infrared measurements on polycrystalline samples of Na$_{0.75}$CoO$_{2}$ and Na$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.95}$Ni$_{0.05}$O$_{2}$, the latter having $T_{\text{MIT}} \sim 175$ K, have been carried out. Dramatic changes in the Na mode frequencies, and relative intensities of the out-of-plane modes corresponding to the two Na sites are observed, coincident with the MIT in Na$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.95}$Ni$_{0.05}$O$_{2}$. It is argued that these changes are associated with a charge ordering of the CoO$_{2}$ layer, associated with the metal–insulator transition.</p>

				<title>Strain-induced modification of magnetic structure and new magnetic phases in rare-earth epitaxial films</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the 50th Annual DAE–BRNS Solid State Physics Symposium</feature>
				<page>0173-0190</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rare earths exhibit complex magnetic phase diagrams resulting from the competition between various contributions to the magnetic energy: exchange, anisotropy and magnetostriction. The epitaxy of a rare-earth film on a substrate induces (i) a clamping to the substrate and (ii) pseudomorphic strains. Both these effects are shown to lead to modifications of the magnetic properties in (0 0 1)Dy, (0 0 1)Tb and (1 1 0)Eu films. In Dy and Tb films, spectacular variations of the Curie temperature have been evidenced. Additionally, Tb films exhibit a new large wavelength magnetic modulation. In Eu films, one of the helical magnetic domains disappears at low temperature whereas the propagation vectors of the other helices are tilted. The link between structural and magnetic properties is underlined via magnetoelastic models. Moreover, molecular beam epitaxy permits the growth of Sm in a metastable dhcp phase. The magnetic structure of dhcp Sm has been elucidated for the first time. In this review, neutron scattering is shown to be a powerful technique to reveal the magnetic structures of rare-earth films.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>By suitable design it is possible to achieve quasi-ballistic transport in semiconductor nanostructures over times up to the ps-range. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that under these conditions phase-coherent real-space oscillations of an electron ensemble, generated by fs-pulses become possible in wide potential wells. Using a two-color pump-and-probe technique we have been able to observe this new phenomenon in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Apart from its fundamental significance, ballistic transport in nanostructures can also be used for high-efficiency coherent THz- sources. The concept of these THz-emitters and its experimental confirmation will also be presented.</p>

				<title>Two-dimensional magnetic ordering in a multilayer structure</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the 50th Annual DAE–BRNS Solid State Physics Symposium</feature>
				<page>0207-0224</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of confinement from one, two or from all three directions on magnetic ordering has remained an active field of research for almost 100 years. The role of dipolar interactions and anisotropy are important to obtain, the otherwise forbidden, ferromagnetic ordering at finite temperature for ions arranged in two-dimensional (2D) arrays (monolayers). We have demonstrated that conventional low-temperature magnetometry and polarized neutron scattering measurements can be performed to study short-range ferromagnetic ordering of in-plane spins in 2D systems using a multilayer stack of non-interacting monolayers of gadolinium ions formed by Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique. The spontaneous magnetization could not be detected in the heterogeneous magnetic phase observed here and the saturation value of the net magnetization was found to depend on the sample temperature and applied magnetic field. The net magnetization rises exponentially with lowering temperature and then reaches saturation following a $T$ ln($\beta T$) dependence. The $T$ ln($\beta T$) dependence of magnetization has been predicted from spin-wave theory of 2D in-plane spin system with ferromagnetic interaction. The experimental findings reported here could be explained by extending this theory to a temperature domain of $\beta T &#60; 1.</p>

We found the same and acceptable energy distribution in these different approaches of the Møller energy–momentum complex. Our teleparallel gravitational result is also independent of the teleparallel dimensionless coupling constant, which means that it is valid in any teleparallel model.

The elliptic flow $v_{2}$ is reasonably well-described at low transverse momentum ($pT &#60; 1$ GeV/c) in mid-central collisions. On the other hand, this model does not explain $v_{2}$ at high $p_{T}$ or in peripheral collisions and thus generally, it underestimates the elliptic flow at RHIC energy.</p>

A calibration method based on determination of SSNTD registration sensitivity ratio for $\alpha$-particles of thorium and uranium series has been developed. Thorium and uranium contents of the standard soil samples have been determined and compared with its known values. There is a good agreement between the results of this method and the values of standard samples.

				<title>A comparative performance evaluation of micro-Raman spectrograph using holographic notch filter and dielectric filter</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0277-0289</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An indigenously designed and developed micro-Raman spectrograph, consisting of a diode-pumped solid-state green laser for the excitation of Raman scattering, a Raman imaging microscope, CCD as a detector and a notch filter, has been extensively studied to evaluate its performance. A dielectric edge filter (having 27 alternate layers of SiO$_{2}$ and TiO$_{2}$) and a holographic notch filter (Oriel make) have been used to block the Rayleigh scattered light from the sample to the entrance slit of the spectrograph. Holographic notch filter is found to be able to record the Raman shifts below 700 cm$^{-1}$ conveniently whereas dielectric edge filter (27 layers) has enabled the spectrograph to record the Raman spectra very efficiently after a wave-number shift of 700 cm$^{-1}$. It has also been observed that the instrument using the edge filter provides a peculiar spectrum consisting of three spectral lines having Raman shifts as 569, 1328 and 1393 cm$^{-1}$ in the Raman spectrum of a weakly scattering sample with large reflectivity. Similarly, a spectrum consisting of multiple lines has been observed when the instrument is being operated using a holographic notch filter. These spectral lines are not observed in the case of liquid samples such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride, ethanol, diethyl ether etc. The origin of these peculiar spectral lines has been briefly discussed in the paper. Additionally, a major motivation for this work is to utilize the results for the selection of an appropriate filter depending on the type of the sample, i.e. weakly scattered and highly reflecting sample or highly scattered and low reflecting sample.</p>

				<title>Self-assembled fluids with order-parameter- dependent mobility: The large-$N$ limit</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0291-0297</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of the order-parameter-dependent mobility, $\Gamma (\vec{\phi}) \propto \left( 1 - g \dfrac{\vec{\phi}^{2}}{N} \right)^{\alpha}$, on phase-ordering dynamics of self-assembled fluids is studied analytically within the large-$N$ limit. The study is for quenching from an uncorrelated high temperature state into the Lifshitz line within the microemulsion phase. In the later stage of the ordering process, the structure factor exhibits multiscaling behavior with characteristic length scale $(t/ {\text{ln}} t)^{1/2(2\alpha+3)}$. The order-parameter-dependent mobility is found to slow down the rate of coarsening.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Transition from chaotic to ordered state has been observed during the initial stage of a discharge in a cylindrical DC glow discharge plasma. Initially it shows a chaotic behavior but increasing the discharge voltage changes the characteristics of the discharge glow and shows a period subtraction of order 7 period $\rightarrow 5$ period $\rightarrow 3$ period $\rightarrow 1$ period, i.e. the system goes to single mode through odd cycle subtraction. On further increasing the discharge voltage, the system goes through period doubling, like 1 period $\rightarrow 2$ period $\rightarrow 4$ period. On further increasing the voltage, the system goes to stable state through two period subtraction, like 4 period $\rightarrow 2$ period $\rightarrow$ stable.</p>

				<title>Phonon and thermal properties of achiral single wall carbon nanotubes</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0305-0317</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed theoretical study of the phonon and thermal properties of achiral single wall carbon nanotubes has been carried out using force constant model considering up to third nearest-neighbor interactions. We have calculated the phonon dispersions, density of states, radial breathing modes (RBM) and the specific heats for various zigzag and armchair nanotubes, with radii ranging from 2.8 Å to 11.0 Å. A comparative study of phonon spectrum with measured Raman data reveals that the number of Raman active modes for a tube does not depend on the number of atoms present in the unit cell but on its chirality. Calculated phonon modes at the zone center more or less accurately predicted the Raman active modes. The radial breathing mode is of particular interest as for a specific radius of a nanotube it is found to be independent of its chirality. We have also calculated the variation of RBM and G-band modes for tubes of different radii. RBM shows an inverse dependence on the radius of the tube. Finally, the values of specific heat are calculated for various nanotubes at room temperature and it was found that the specific heat shows an exponential dependence on the diameter of the tube.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The thermodynamic properties of Sb-Sn and In-Sn liquid alloys have been studied using the quasi-chemical model for compound forming binary alloys and that for simple regular alloys. The concentration fluctuation $S_{cc}(0)$ and the Warren-Cowley short-range order parameter ($\alpha_{1}$) were determined for the whole concentration range at a temperature of 770 K. The surface tensions of these liquid alloys were determined for the whole concentration range by using energetics determined from thermodynamic calculations. In all calculations, In{Sn manifested properties very close to alloys of ideal mixing, while Sb-Sn showed properties that are asymmetric about equiatomic composition. Our results suggest that a weak complex of the form SbSn$_{2}$ could be present in the Sb-Sn alloy at a temperature of about 770 K.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A study of electronic conductivity using the DC polarization technique has been carried out for AgI and Ag$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$I (where $x = 0.05, 0.15, 0.25$) solid solutions over a range of temperatures from 300 K to 473 K. A diode-like current-voltage characteristics arises from microscopic p-n junctions and an enhanced electronic conductivity of the order of 10$^{-3}$A is observed for undoped AgI and Cu-doped AgI. Activation energies ($E_{a}$) for electronic conductivity obtained from log $\sigma ($\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$) vs. $1000/T(K^{-1})$ were 0.48, 0.6, 0.74 and 1.01 eV for AgI, Ag$_{0.95}$Cu$_{0.05}$I, Ag$_{0.85}$Cu$_{0.15}$I and Ag$_{0.75}$Cu$_{0.25}$I solid solutions respectively. The near-twofold increase in activation energy (1.01 eV) observed upon $25\%$ Cu doping is due to the substantial concentration of current carriers/holes injected by Cu while replacing Ag$^{+}$ in AgI.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0341-0349</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electroplating technique is especially interesting due to its low cost, high throughput and high quality of deposit. Magnetic thin films are extensively used in various electronic devices including high-density recording media and micro electro-mechanical (MEMS) devices. Due to these potential applications, deposition of magnetic fiolm draws special attention and it needs a cost-effective process. Electro-deposition being cost-effective, in the present work cobalt-based magnetic films were deposited electro-chemically and deposition characteristics were studied. Effect of concentration of organic additives such as urea and thiourea in the presence of sodium hypophosphite was studied. Surface characterisation was carried out using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Elemental compositions of the films were studied using atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) and showed phosphorous content was less than $1\%$. Samples were subjected to vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and studies showed that organic additive has altered magnetic properties of these films. The reason for change in magnetic properties and structural characteristics because of the additives were discussed. Mechanical properties such as residual stress, hardness and adhesion of the films were also examined and reported.</p>

					<p>Proton and alpha particle spectra have been measured in the $^{12}C + ^{93}Nb$ and $^{12}C + ^{58}Ni$ reactions at $E(^{12}C) = 40$ and 50 MeV and in the $^{16}O + ^{93}Nb$ reaction at $E(^{16}O) = 75$ MeV. The spectra are compared with the statistical model calculations. The shapes of the calculated spectra are in agreement with experimental data except for the alpha spectrum in the $^{12}C + ^{93}Nb$ reaction at 40 MeV. The observed evaporation bump is at $\sim 2$ MeV lower energy compared to the calculated one. This discrepancy could imply alpha particle emission from a deformed configuration before compound nucleus formation at this near Coulomb barrier beam energy.</p>

				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0375-0381</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dielectric relaxation study of the binary mixtures of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) (Mw = 24000, 40000 and 360000 g mol$^{−1}$) with ethyl alcohol (EA) and poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEGs) (Mw = 200 and 400 g mol$^{−1}$) in dilute solutions of dioxane were carried out at 10.1 GHz and $35^{\circ$} C. The relaxation time of PVP–EA mixtures was interpreted by the consideration of a wait-and-switch model in the local structure of self-associated ethyl alcohol molecules and also the PVP chain length as a geometric constraint for the reorientational motion of ethyl alcohol molecules. The formation of complexes and effect of PVP chain length on the molecular dynamics, chain flexibility and stretching of PEG molecules in PVP–PEG mixtures were explored from the comparative values of dielectric relaxation time. Further, relaxation time values in dioxane and benzene solvent confirm the viscosity independent molecular dynamics in PVP–EA mixtures but the values vary significantly with the non-polar solvent environment.</p>

				<title>Study of fiber optic sugar sensor</title>
				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0383-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Over the last two decades, the fiber optic technology has passed through many analytical stages. Some commercially available fiber optic sensors, though in a small way, are being used for automation in mechanical and industrial environments. They are also used for instrumentation and controls.</p>
					<p>In the present work, an intensity-modulated intrinsic fiber optic sugar sensor is presented. This type of sensor, with slight modification, can be used for on-line determination of the concentration of sugar content in sugarcane juice in sugar industry.</p>
					<p>In the present set-up, a plastic fiber made of polymethylmethacrylate is used. A portion of the cladding (1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm) at the mid-point along the length of the fiber is removed. This portion is immersed in sugar solution of known concentration and refractive index. At one end of the fiber an 850 nm source is used and at the other end a power meter is connected. By varying the concentration of sugar solution, the output power is noted. These studies are made due to the change in refractive index of the fluid. The device was found to be very sensitive which is free from EMI and shock hazards, stable and repeatable and they can be remotely interfaced with a computer to give on-line measurements and thus become useful for application in sugar industries.</p>

				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0395-0400</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present an investigation of the nature of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in a bundle by resonant Raman spectroscopy. The calculation has been done for the three peak positions in radial breathing mode (RBM) spectra obtained by using a laser excitation wavelength ($\lambda$) of 633 nm from He–Ne laser on SWNT bundle sample prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique using iron catalyst at $800^{\circ}$ C. The detailed analysis in the present study is focused on peak positions 162 cm$^{−1}$, 186 cm$^{−1}$, and 216 cm$^{−1}$. The first step of the analysis is to construct a list of possible ($n, m$) pairs from the diameters calculated from the RBM peak positions. The parameters of SWNTs studied gives in-depth understanding of many symmetry, resonance and characteristic properties of SWNT bundles. Our results indicate that the contribution of metallic SWNTs in the bundle is small at RBM peak positions 162 cm$^{−1}$, 186 cm$^{−1}$ and in agreement with pervious results at peak position 216 cm$^{−1}$.</p>

				<title>Resonance-like tunneling across a barrier with adjacent wells</title>

				<page>0401-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We examine the behavior of transmission coefficient $T$ across the rectangular barrier when attractive potential well is present on one or both sides and also the same is studied for a smoother barrier with smooth adjacent wells having Woods–Saxon shape. We find that presence of well with suitable width and depth can substantially alter $T$ at energies below the barrier height leading to resonant-like structures. In a sense, this work is complementary to the resonant tunneling of particles across two rectangular barriers, which is being studied in detail in recent years with possible applications in mind. We interpret our results as due to resonant-like positive energy states generated by the adjacent wells. We describe in detail the possible potential application of these results in electronic devices using n-type oxygen-doped gallium arsenide and silicon dioxide. It is envisaged that these results will have applications in the design of tunneling devices.</p>

					<p>The ion current from an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) heavy ion source depends on the confining axial and radial magnetic fields. Some efforts were made by earlier workers to investigate magnetic field scaling on the performance of the ECR source. In order to study the dependence of the ion current on the injection magnetic field in the 6.4 GHz ECR source, we have measured the current by varying the peak injection field and have inferred that the variation of the current is exponential up to our maximum design injection field of 7.5 kG. An attempt has been made to understand this exponential nature on the basis of ion confinement time.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0487-0501</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A theoretical study of the mechanism of photodecomposition in carbonyl cyanide, diethynyl ketone, acetyl cyanide and formyl cyanide has been conducted using density functional and MP2 theories. A complete analysis of the electronic spectra of these molecules in terms of nature, energy and intensity of electronic transitions has been provided by time-dependent density functional theory. Mixing coefficients and main configurations of the electronic states have been used to identify the states leading to the photodecomposition process. While the Rydberg state $^{1}$(n,3s) is involved in the dissociation of formyl cyanide and acetyl cyanide, the $\pi^{*}_{CC} / \pi^{*}_{CN}$ states are involved in the case of carbonyl cyanide and diethynyl ketone. In all cases, however, stepwise decomposition process is preferred over the concerted reaction process. Based on potential energy curves for bond dissociation and the transition state and IRC studies, it is found that besides the direct dissociation of carbonyl cyanide, a photoisomerization process through a non-planar transition state may also occur resulting in the formation of a stable and planar isomer CNC(O)CN. A complete vibrational analysis of the higher energy isomer has been conducted and several new fundamental bands are predicted. Some of the earlier experimental results on the photodecomposition mechanism and energies of photofragments in carbonyl cyanide and acetyl cyanide have also been rationalized.</p>

					<p>The total $\gamma$-ray interaction crosss-sections on mixed absorbers were determined at 662 keV with a view to study the effective atomic numbers for $\gamma$-ray absorption under narrow beam good geometry set-up. The measurements were taken for the combination of metallic absorbers like aluminium, copper, lead and mercury and also for the simulated absorbers by rotating the targets.

				<abstract>
					<p>We have carried out some photon interaction measurements using 59.54 keV $\gamma$-rays from a $^{241}$Am source. These include $\gamma$ attenuation studies as well as photoelectric absorption studies in various samples. The attenuation studies have been made using leaf and wood samples, samples like sand, sugar etc., which contain particles of varying sizes as well as pellets and aqueous solutions of rare earth compounds. In the case of the leaf and wood samples, we have used the $\gamma$-ray attenuation technique for the determination of the water content in fresh and dried samples. The variation of the attenuation coefficient with particle size has been investigated for sand and sugar samples. The attenuation studies as well as the photoelectric studies in the case of rare earth elements have been carried out on samples containing such elements whose K-absorption edge energies lie below and close to the $\gamma$-energy used. Suitable compounds of the rare earth elements have been chosen as mixture absorbers in these investigations. A narrow beam good geometry set-up was used for the attenuation measurements. A well-shielded scattering geometry was used for the photoelectric measurements. The mixture rule was invoked to extract the values of the mass attenuation coefficients for the elements from those of the corresponding compounds. The results are consistent with theoretical values derived from the XCOM package.</p>

For the calculation, method of statistical double-time temperature-dependent Green's function has been used. By fitting model values of physical quantities, temperature and electric field dependences of soft mode frequency, dielectric constant and loss have been calculated which compare well with experimental results of Baumgartner [8] and Choi and Lockwood [9]. Both dielectric constant and loss decrease with electric field.</p>

					<p>Establishing CP-violation in the lepton sector is one of the most challenging future tasks in neutrino physics. The lepton mixing matrix contains one Dirac phase and, if neutrinos are Majorana particles, two additional CP-violating phases. I will review the main theoretical aspects of CP-violation in the lepton sector. Then, I will present the strategies for determining the Dirac and the Majorana CP-violating phases in long-baseline and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, respectively. Leptonic CP-violation has received recently a lot of attention as it might be at the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Within the context of the see-saw mechanism, I will discuss the possible connection between the CP-violating phases measurable at low energy with the ones entering in leptogenesis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>What is new in the field of neutrino detection? In addition to new projects probing both the low and high ends of the neutrino energy scale, an inexpensive, effective technique is being developed to allow tagging of antineutrinos in water Cherenkov (WC) detectors via the addition to water of a solute with a large neutron cross-section and energetic $\gamma$ daughters. Gadolinium is an excellent candidate since in recent years it has become very inexpensive, now less than $\$8$ per kilogram in the form of commercially available gadolinium trichloride. This non-toxic, non-reactive substance is highly soluble in water. Neutron capture on gadolinium yields an 8.0 MeV gamma cascade easily seen in detectors like Super-Kamiokande. The uses of GdCl$_{3}$ as a possible upgrade for the Super-Kamiokande detector - with a view toward improving its performance as an antineutrino detector for supernova neutrinos and reactor neutrinos - are discussed, as are the ongoing R $\&$ D efforts which aim to make this dream a reality within the next two years.</p>

The expectation of the paradigm of inflation and the generic prediction of the simplest realization of inflationary scenario in the early Universe have also been established - `acausally' correlated initial perturbations in a flat, statistically isotropic Universe, adiabatic nature of primordial density perturbations. Direct evidence for gravitational instability mechanism for structure formation from primordial perturbations has been established. In the next decade, future experiments promise to strengthen these deductions and uncover the remaining crucial signature of inflation - the primordial gravitational wave background.</p>

				<title>Is dark matter visible by galactic gamma rays?</title>
				<feature>Working Group 2: Neutrino and Astroparticle Physics</feature>
				<page>0711-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The EGRET excess in the diffuse galactic gamma ray data above 1 GeV shows all features expected from dark matter WIMP annihilation: (a) It is present and has the same spectrum in all sky directions, not just in the galactic plane. (b) The intensity of the excess shows the $1/r^{2}$ profile expected for a flat rotation curve outside the galactic disc with an additionally interesting substructure in the disc in the form of a doughnut-shaped ring at 14 kpc from the centre of the galaxy. At this radius a ring of stars indicates the probable infall of a dwarf galaxy, which can explain the increase in DM density. From the spectral shape of the excess the WIMP mass is estimated to be between 50 and 100 GeV, while from the intensity the halo profile is reconstructed. Given the mass and intensity of the WIMPs the mass of the ring can be calculated, which is shown to explain the peculiar change of slope in the rotation curve at about 11 kpc. These results are model-independent in the sense that only the known shapes of signal and background were fitted with free normalization factors, thus being independent of model-dependent flux calculations. The statistical significance is more than $10\sigma$ in comparison with a fit of the conventional galactic model to the EGRET data. These signals of dark matter annihilation are compatible with supersymmetry including all electroweak constraints. The statistical significance combined with all features mentioned above provide an intriguing hint that the EGRET excess is indeed a signal from dark matter annihilation.</p>

				<title>CP-violations in $B$ decays</title>
				<feature>Working Group 3: Flavor Physics and Model Building</feature>
				<page>0763-0772</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent results on CP-violation measurements in $B$ decays from energy asymmetric $B$-factory experiments are reported. Thanks to large accumulated data samples, CP-violations in $B$ decays in mixing-decay interference and direct CP-violation are now firmly established. The measurements of three angles of the unitarity triangle from CP-violations of $B$ decays are quite consistent with the Standard Model expectations. These results strongly support the validity of the Kobayashi-Maskawa prescription of CP-violation.</p>

				<title>New physics hints in $B$ decays and collider outlook</title>
				<feature>Working Group 3: Flavor Physics and Model Building</feature>
				<page>0773-0782</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There are currently two hints for new physics involving CP violation in $b \rightarrow s$ transitions: $\Delta S \equiv S_{f} - S_{J/\phi K} \neq 0$, and difference in direct CP asymmetry $\Delta A_{K\pi} \equiv A_{K^{+} \pi^{0}} - A_{K^{+} \pi^{-}} \neq 0$. We explore the two scenarious with a large and unique new CP phase in $b \leftrightarrow s$ tansitions. Motivated by $\Delta S \neq 0$, we update on the right-handed strange-beauty squark $\tilde{sb}_{1R}$ at TeV scale. Motivated by $\Delta A_{K\pi} \neq 0$, we explore sequential fourth generation $t'$ and $b'$ quarks. Both scenarious can survive constraints such as SM level $b \rightarrow s\gamma, s\ell\ell$ and $B_{s}$ mixing, and predict sizable CP violation in $B_{s}$ mixing. The fourth generation picture predicts sizable $K_{L} \rigtharrow \pi^{0} \nu\nu$. Direct search for $\tilde{sb}_{R}$, $b'$ and $t'$ at hadronic colliders, such as Tevatron Run II and LHC, can complement further CP violation studies 					at these machines, as well as at the future Super $B$ factory.</p>

				<feature>Working Group 3: Flavor Physics and Model Building</feature>
				<page>0783-0791</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>See-saw mechanism has been a dominant paradigm in the discussion of neutrino masses. We discuss how this idea can be tested via a baryon number violating process such as $N-\bar{N}$ oscillation. Since the expected see-saw scale is high and the $N-\bar{N}$ amplitude goes like $M_{R}^{-5}$, one might think that this process is not observable in realistic see-saw models for neutrino masses. In this talk I show that in supersymmetric models, the above conclusion is circumvented leading to an enhanced and observable rate for $N-\bar{N}$ oscillation. I also discuss a new mechanism for baryogenesis in generic models for neutron-anti-neutron oscillation.</p>

For weak magnetic fields, the correct Standard Model spectrum guarantees gauge coupling unification with $\sin^{2} \theta_{W} = 3/8$ at the com-pactification scale of $M_{GUT} \simeq 2 \times 10^{16}$ GeV.

				<abstract>
					<p>In this talk I discuss some aspects of CP violation (CPV) in supersymmetry (SUSY) as well as in the Higgs sector. Further, I discuss ways in which these may be probed at hadronic colliders. In particular I will point out the ways in which studies in the $\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}$, $\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}$ sector at the Tevatron may be used to provide information on this and how the search can be extended to the LHC. I will then follow this by a discussion of the CP mixing induced in the Higgs sector due to the above-mentioned CPV in the soft SUSY breaking parameters and its effects on the Higgs phenomenology at the LHC. I would then point out some interesting aspects of the phenomenology of a moderately light charged Higgs boson, consistent with the LEP constraints, in this scenario. Decay of such a charged Higgs boson would also allow a probe of a light ($\lesssim 50$ GeV), CP-violating (CPV) Higgs boson. Such a light neutral Higgs boson might have escaped detection at LEP and could also be missed at the LHC in the usual search channels.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present the explicit form of the symplectic structure of anti-self-dual Yang–Mills (ASDYM) equations in Yang's $J$- and $K$-gauges in order to establish the bi-Hamiltonian structure of this completely integrable system. Dirac's theory of constraints is applied to the degenerate Lagrangians that yield the ASDYM equations. The constraints are second class as in the case of all completely integrable systems which stands in sharp contrast to the situation in full Yang–Mills theory. We construct the Dirac brackets and the symplectic 2-forms for both $J$- and $K$-gauges. The covariant symplectic structure of ASDYM equations is obtained using the Witten–Zuckerman formalism. We show that the appropriate component of the Witten–Zuckerman closed and conserved 2-form vector density reduces to the symplectic 2-form obtained from Dirac's theory. Finally, we present the Bäcklund transformation between the $J$- and $K$-gauges in order to apply Magri's theorem to the respective two Hamiltonian structures.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1055-1071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The quantum dynamics of an electron moving under the Henon–Heiles (HH) potential in the presence of external time-dependent (TD) laser fields of varying intensities have been studied by evolving in real time the unperturbed ground-state wave function $\phi(x, y, t)$ of the HH oscillator. The TD Schröinger equation is solved numerically and the system is allowed to generate its own wave packet. Two kinds of sensitivities, namely, sensitivity to the initial quantum state and to the Hamiltonian, are examined. The threshold intensity of the laser field for an electron moving in the HH potential to reach its continuum is identified and in this region quantum chaos has been diagnosed through a combination of various dynamical signatures such as the autocorrelation function, quantum `phase-space' volume, `phase-space' trajectory, distance function and overlap integral (akin to quantum fidelity or Loschmidt echo), in terms of the sensitivity towards an initial state characterized by a mixture of quantum states (wave packet) brought about by small changes in the Hamiltonian, rather than a `pure' quantum state (a single eigenstate). The similarity between the HH potential and atoms/molecules in intense laser fields is also analyzed.</p>

We have derived exact analytical expressions for coherences and populations keeping all the orders of probe field Rabi frequency ($G$) and coherent field Rabi frequency ($\Omega$) in the steady state limit. Previously, first-order approximation (i.e. keeping only the first-order term in $G$) was used and hence AWI was studied for the condition $\Omega \gg G$. Here, by using the exact analytical expressions of coherences and populations, we have shown that AWI is maximum when $\Omega$ is within the same order of probe field Rabi frequency $G$ irrespective of the choice of different ro-vibrational transitions in both the molecules. However, the shape of the gain profile and the maximum value  of gain on the probe field and the absorption on coherent field depend on the choice of different ro-vibrational levels as the upper lasing levels. Effect of bidirectional pumping, homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening on AWI process has been studied. By solving the density matrix equations numerically it has been shown that both the transient and the steady state AWI can be obtained and the numerical values of coherences and populations at large time are in very good agreement with exact analytical values in the steady state limit. It has been shown that in molecules AWI can be obtained on probe field of smaller wavelength than that of the coherent field which has not been observed in atoms so far.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Solid state laser (SSL) powers can be realistically scaled when pumped by a real, efficient and multimode pulse. In this work, a fourth-order super-Gaussian pulse was assumed as a pump for SSL's and a complete analytical expression for the thermal phase shift is given. Moreover, the focal length of thermal lens in paraxial ray approximation regime was studied. The results when applied to a Ti : sapphire crystal show an appreciable correction for abberation compared to a top-hat pulse.</p>

				<title>Mode-to-mode energy transfers in convective patterns</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>1129-1140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the energy transfer between various Fourier modes in a low-dimensional model for thermal convection. We have used the formalism of mode-to-mode energy transfer rate in our calculation. The evolution equations derived using this scheme is the same as those derived using the hydrodynamical equations for thermal convection in Boussinesq fluids. Numerical and analytical studies of this model show that convective rolls appear as the Rayleigh number $R$ is raised above its critical value $R_{c}$. Further increase of Rayleigh number generates rolls in the perpendicular directions as well, and we obtain a dynamic asymmetric square pattern. This pattern is due to Hopf bifurcation. There are two sets of limit cycles corresponding to the two competing asymmetric square patterns. When the Rayleigh number is increased further, the limit cycles become unstable simultaneously, and chaotic motion sets in. The onset of chaos is via intermittent route. The trajectories wander for quite a long time almost periodically before jumping irregularly to one of the two ghost limit cycles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have carried out Monte Carlo simulations in Gibbs ensemble for two-and three-dimensional double Yukawa fluid. We have compared liquid–vapour equilibrium curve with that of Lennard-Jones, when parameters occurring in double Yukawa potential are chosen to fit Lennard-Jones potential. The results are in good agreement. The role of repulsive and attractive contributions for the potential on the liquid–vapour coexistence region as well as on critical temperature and critical density has been studied. The critical temperature is found to be more sensitive than the critical density to the variation in repulsive and attractive parts of the potential. Also, the range of the attractive interaction directly influences range of the liquid–vapour coexistence region. It has been found that smaller the values of the attractive parameter, larger is the coexistence region.</p>

					<p>The polarization-dependent photonic band gaps (TM and TE polarizations) in two-dimensional photonic crystals with square lattices composed of air holes in dielectric and {\textit{vice versa}} i.e., dielectric rods in air, using the plane-wave expansion method are investigated. We then study, how the photonic band gap size is affected by the changing ellipticity of the constituent air holes/dielectric rods. It is observed that the size of the photonic band gap changes with changing ellipticity of the constituent air holes/dielectric rods. Further, it is reported, how the photonic band gap size is affected by the change in the orientation of the constituent elliptical air holes/dielectric rods in 2D photonic crystals.</p>

					<p>This paper presents the results of modelling of both magnetic and magnetostrictive properties of high permeability Mn$_{0.51}$Zn$_{0.44}$Fe$_{2.05}$O$_{4}$ ferrites. The parameters of energy-based Jiles–Atherton–Sablik (J–A–S) model were calculated for each experimental hysteresis loop on the basis of evolutionary strategies and Hook–Jevis optimization method. Finally, high conformity between experimental and modelling results was achieved. This high conformity indicates that the presented results create new opportunity of modelling of the properties of inductive components based on ferrites as well as quantitative description of magnetization process.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present the calculation of envelope of boson and of both low- and high- mass fermion production at the end of inflation when the coherently oscillating inflatons decay into bosons and fermions. We consider three different models of inflation and use CWKB technique to calculate the envelope to understand the structure of resonance band formation. We observe that though low-mass fermion production is not effective in pre-heating because of Pauli blocking, it is quite probable for high-mass fermion to take part in pre-heating.</p>

				<title>Optimization of C$^{5+}$ Balmer-$\alpha$ line intensity at 182 Å from laser-produced carbon plasma</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0043-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Parametric dependence of the intensity of 182 Å Balmer-$\alpha$ line $(C^{5+}; n = 3 \rightarrow 2)$, relevant to xuv soft X-ray lasing schemes, from laser-produced carbon plasma is studied in circular spot focusing geometry using a flat field grating spectrograph. The maximum spectral intensity for this line in space integrated mode occurred at a laser intensity of $1.2 \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{−2}$. At this laser intensity, the space resolved measurements show that the spectral intensity of this line peaks at $\sim 1.5$ mm from the target surface indicating the maximum population of C$^{5+}$ ions $(n = 3)$, at this distance. From a comparison of spatial intensity variation of this line with that of C$^{5+}$ Ly-$\alpha$ $(n = 2 \rightarrow 1)$ line, it is inferred that $n = 3$ state of C$^{5+}$ ions is predominantly populated through three-body recombination pumping of C$^{6+}$ ions of the expanding plasma consistent with quantitative estimates on recombination rates of different processes.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of carbon nanotubes by catalytic vapor decomposition (CVD) method: Optimization of various parameters for the maximum yield </title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0051-0060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes an effect of flow rate, carrier gas (H$_{2}$, N$_{2}$ and Ar) composition, and amount of benzene on the quality and the yield of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) formed by catalytical vapour decomposition (CVD) method. The flow and mass control of gases and precursor vapors respectively were found to be interdependent and therefore crucial in deciding the quality and yield of CNTs. We have achieved this by modified soap bubble flowmeter, which controlled the flow rates of two gases, simultaneously. With the help of this set-up, CNTs could be prepared in any common laboratory. Raman spectroscopy indicated the possibilities of formation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). From scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements, an average diameter of the tube/bundle was estimated to be about 70 nm. The elemental analysis using energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) suggested 96 at.wt.$\%$ carbon along with ca. 4 at.wt. $\%$ iron in the as-prepared sample. Maximum yield and best quality CNTs were obtained using H$_{2}$ as the carrier gas.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of hydrogen absorption on electrical resistance with temperature for TiNi and TiNi–Cr thin films was investigated. The TiNi thin films of thickness 800 Å  were deposited at different angles ($\theta = 0^{\circ}, 30^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}$ and $75^{\circ}) under 10$^{−5}$ Torr pressure by thermal evaporation on the glass substrate at room temperature. A layer of Cr of thickness 100 Å was coated on the TiNi thin films. The changing rate of hydrogen absorption increases after Cr layer coating because Cr enhances the catalytic properties of hydrogen absorption in thin films. The rate of hydrogen absorption increases with temperature at lower range but at higher range of temperature it was found to decrease and also it was found that the hydrogen absorption increases with angle of deposition.</p>

The structure and giant magneto- resistance (GMR) effect of CuCoNi alloys have been investigated. The maximum value for GMR ratio, at room temperature is $1\%$ at a field of 12 kOe, and at 20 K is $2.1\%$ at a field of 8.5 kOe for 3.1 Ni. The MR ratio of Cu$_{100−y−x}$Co$_{y}$Ni$_{x}$ alloys first increases and then decreases monotonically with increasing Ni content.

To compare our experimental data, the theoretical computations have also been carried out within the framework of pseudopotential using CRYSTAL03 code and the renormalized-free-atom (RFA) model. It is found that the present experimental profile is in better agreement with the RFA calculations if the outer electronic configuration is chosen as 5d$^{3.2}$6s$^{0.8}$.

					<p>A two-dimensional tilted axis cranking Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov (CHFB) calculation is performed for $^{76}$Kr and $^{78}$Kr nuclei up to high spins $J = 30$ employing a pairing-plus-quadrupole (PPQ) model interaction Hamiltonian. Intricate details of the evolution of single particle structures and shapes as a function of spin have been investigated. The results show the existence of energy levels with high $K$ quantum numbers lying close to the yrast line in both the nuclei. Such high $K$ states should exhibit isomeric characteristics due to the $K$-selection rules for the $\gamma$-decays. Moreover, in $^{78}$Kr a new band with $J = 20–30$ lying below the observed ground band is predicted.</p>

					<p>Quantitative explanation for the odd–even effect on fragment angular momenta in the low-energy fission of actinides have been provided by taking into account the single particle spin of the odd proton at the fragment's scission point deformation in the case of odd-$Z$ fragments along with the contribution from the population of angular momentum bearing collective vibrations of the fissioning nucleus at scission point. The calculated fragment angular momenta have been found to be in very good agreement with the experimental data for fragments in the mass number region of 130–140.

				<abstract>
					<p>Using the hydrodynamic model of semiconductor plasma, the diffusion-induced nonlinear current density and the consequent second-order effective susceptibility are obtained under off-resonant laser irradiation. The analysis deals with the qualitative behaviour of the anomalous parametric dispersion and the gain profile with respect to the excess doping concentration and pump electric field. The analysis suggests that a proper selection of doping level and pump field may lead to either positive or negative enhanced parametric dispersion, which can be of great use in the generation of sequeezed states. It is found that gain maximizes at moderate doping concentration level, which may drastically reduce the fabrication cost of parametric amplifier based on this interaction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This work presents the results of a low-energy nitrogen ion implantation of AISI 304 type stainless steel (SS) at a moderate temperature of about 500$^{\circ}$ C. The nitrogen ions are extracted from a Kauffman-type ion source at an energy of 30 keV, and ion current density of 100 $\mu$A cm$^{−2}$. Nitrogen ion concentration of $6 \times 10^{17}$, $8 \times 10^{17}$ and $10^{18}$ ions cm$^{−2}$, were selected for our study. The X-ray diffraction results show the formation of CrN polycrystalline phase after nitrogen bombardment and a change of crystallinity due to the change in nitrogen ion concentration. The secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) results show the formation of CrN phases too. Corrosion test has shown that corrosion resistance is enhanced by increasing nitrogen ion concentration.</p>

				<title>Operation of CANDU power reactor in thorium self-sufficient fuel cycle</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the Workshop on Physics of Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System for Energy and Transmutation (WP-ADS-E&#38;T)</feature>
				<page>0143-0150</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the results of calculations for CANDU reactor operation in thorium fuel cycle. Calculations are performed to estimate the feasibility of operation of heavy-water thermal neutron power reactor in self-sufficient thorium cycle. Parameters of active core and scheme of fuel reloading were considered to be the same as for standard operation in uranium cycle. Two modes of operations are discussed in the paper: mode of preliminary accumulation of $^{233}$U and mode of operation in self-sufficient cycle. For the mode of accumulation of $^{233}$U it was assumed for calculations that plutonium can be used as additional fissile material to provide neutrons for $^{233}$U production. Plutonium was placed in fuel channels, while $^{232}$Th was located in target channels. Maximum content of $^{233}$U in target channels was estimated to be $\sim 13$ kg/t of ThO$_{2}$. This was achieved by irradiation for six years. The start of the reactor operation in the self-sufficient mode requires $^{233}$U content to be not less than 12 kg/t. For the mode of operation in self-sufficient cycle, it was assumed that all channels were loaded with identical fuel assemblies containing ThO$_{2}$ and certain amount of $^{233}$U. It is shown that nonuniform distribution of $^{233}$U in fuel assembly is preferable.</p>

				<title>A conceptual high flux reactor design with scope for use in ADS applications</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the Workshop on Physics of Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System for Energy and Transmutation (WP-ADS-E&#38;T)</feature>
				<page>0151-0159</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A 100 MWt reactor design has been conceived to support flux level of the order of 10$^{15}$ n/cm$^{2}$/s in selected flux trap zones. The physics design considers high enriched metallic alloy fuel in the form of annular plates placed in a D$_{2}$O moderator tank in a hexagonal lattice arrangement. By choosing a tight lattice pitch in the central region and double the lattice pitch in the outer region, it is possible to have both high fast flux and thermal flux trap zones. By design the flux level in the seed fuel has been kept lower than in the high flux trap zones so that the burning rate of the seed is reduced. Another important objective of the design is to maximize the time interval of refueling. As against a typical refueling interval of a few weeks in such high flux reactor cores, it is desired to maximize this period to as much as six months or even one year. This is possible to achieve by eliminating the conventional control absorbers and replacing them with a suitable amount of fertile material loading in the reactor. Requisite number of seedless thorium–aluminum alloy plates are placed at regular lattice locations vacated by seed fuel in alternate fuel layers. It is seen that these thorium plates are capable of acquiring asymptotic fissile content of 14 g/kg in about 100 days of irradiation at a flux level of $8 \times 10^{14}$ n/cm$^{2}$ /s. In summary, the core has a relatively higher fast flux in the central region and high thermal flux in the outer region. The present physics design envisages a flat core excess reactivity for the longest possible cycle length of 6 months to one year. It is also possible to modify the design for constant subcriticality for about the same period or longer duration by considering neutron spallation source at the centre and curtailing the power density in the inner core region by shielding it with a layer of thoria fuel loading.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, there has been an increasing worldwide interest in accelerator driven systems (ADS) due to their perceived superior safety characteristics and their potential for burning actinides and long-lived fission products. Indian interest in ADS has an additional dimension, which is related to our planned large-scale thorium utilization for future nuclear energy generation.</p>
					<p>The physics of ADS is quite different from that of critical reactors. As such, physics studies on ADS reactors are necessary for gaining an understanding of these systems. Development of theoretical tools and experimental facilities for studying the physics of ADS reactors constitute important aspect of the ADS development program at BARC. This includes computer codes for burnup studies based on transport theory and Monte Carlo methods, codes for studying the kinetics of ADS and sub-critical facilities driven by 14 MeV neutron generators for ADS experiments and development of sub-criticality measurement methods. The paper discusses the physics issues specific to ADS reactors and presents the status of the reactor physics program and some of the ADS concepts under study.</p>

				<title>On the transmutation of Am in a fast lead-cooled system</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the Workshop on Physics of Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System for Energy and Transmutation (WP-ADS-E&#38;T)</feature>
				<page>0193-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Characteristics of the equilibrium fuel cycle for the core or a blanket of ADS having the structure of the core of a fast lead-cooled reactor of type BREST (Russian abbreviation for `Bystryy Reaktor so Svintsovym Teplonositelem') in a mode of americium transmutation are calculated. Americium loading was taken $5\%$ of heavy atoms. Keeping the average multiplication factor the same as in a standard equilibrium cycle, reactivity swing over 1 year's microcycle is about $1\%$, that demands partial fuel reloading with a periodicity of about one month. For one year of operation, 61 kg of americium is destroyed, and due to increased $^{238}$Pu content, americium is mainly converted to fission products. Thus in a system of 1 GWt (thermal), 87 kg of americium can be transmuted yearly. The estimate of the reactivity void effect has shown that it increases to $0.6\%$ almost linearly with the void fraction increasing up to $25\%$ and reaches its maximum of $0.7\%$ at a void fraction of about $50\%$. Application of similar strategy for ADS with a sub-criticality level $\approx 0.96–0.98$ can essentially relax safety problems related to positive void effects.</p>

					<p>Some numerical methods for reactor cell, sub-critical systems and 3D models of nuclear reactors are presented. The methods are developed for steady states and space–time calculations. Computer code TRIFON solves space-energy problem in ($X, Y$) systems of finite height and calculates heterogeneous few-group matrix parameters of reactor cells. These parameters are used as input data in the computer code SHERHAN solving the 3D heterogeneous reactor equation for steady states and 3D space–time neutron processes simulation. Modification of TRIFON was developed for the simulation of space–time processes in sub-critical systems with external sources. An option of SHERHAN code for the system with external sources is under development.</p>

				<title>Accelerator driven systems from the radiological safety point of view</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the Workshop on Physics of Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System for Energy and Transmutation (WP-ADS-E&#38;T)</feature>
				<page>0225-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the proposed accelerator driven systems (ADS) the possible use of several milliamperes of protons of about 1 GeV incident on high mass targets like the molten lead–bismuth eutectic is anticipated to pose radiological problems that have so far not been encountered by the radiation protection community. Spallation reaction products like high energy gammas, neutrons, muons, pions and several radiotoxic nuclides including Po-210 complicate the situation. In the present paper, we discuss radiation safety measures like bulk shielding, containment of radiation leakage through ducts and penetration and induced activity in the structure to protect radiation workers as well as estimation of sky-shine, soil and ground water activation, release of toxic gases to the environment to protect public as per the stipulations of the regulatory authorities. We recommend the application of the probabilistic safety analysis technique by assessing the probability and criticality of different hazard-initiating events using HAZOP and FMECA.</p>

				<title>Optimization studies of photo-neutron production in high-$Z$ metallic targets using high energy electron beam for ADS and transmutation</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the Workshop on Physics of Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System for Energy and Transmutation (WP-ADS-E&#38;T)</feature>
				<page>0235-0241</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Monte Carlo calculations have been performed using MCNP code to study the optimization of photo-neutron yield for different electron beam energies impinging on Pb, W and Ta cylindrical targets of varying thickness. It is noticed that photo-neutron yield can be increased for electron beam energies $\geq 100$ MeV for appropriate thickness of the target. It is also noticed that it can be maximized by further increasing the thickness of the target. Further, at higher electron beam energy heat gradient in the target decreases, which facilitates easier heat removal from the target. This can help in developing a photo-neutron source based on electron LINAC by choosing appropriate electron beam energy and target thickness to optimize the neutron flux for ADS, transmutation studies and as high energy neutron source etc. Photo-neutron yield for different targets, optimum target thickness and photo-neutron energy spectrum and heat deposition by electron beam for different incident energy is presented.</p>

					<p>In this report, the purpose and status of the currently constructed ITEP experimental accelerator driven system (XADS) are discussed. This hybrid electro-nuclear facility of moderate power integrates the pulse proton linac (36 MeV, 0.5 mA) and heavy water sub-critical blanket assembly (heat power of 100 kW). Most parts of the equipment units are ordered for industrial manufacturing and some are under development. The facility is supposed to be used for investigations of a wide range of problems concerning both the target-blanket assembly and the accelerator-driver and at the same time explore the dynamical processes arising during their combined operation. Some other applications of the proton beam and neutron source are also discussed. It is possible in future to increase the current and energy of proton or heavy ion beam.</p>

				<page>0269-0278</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the outstanding new developments in the field of partitioning and transmutation (P&#38;T) concerns accelerator-driven systems (ADS) which consist of a combination of a high-power, high-energy accelerator, a spallation target for neutron production and a sub-critical reactor core. The development of the commercial critical reactors of today motivated a large effort on nuclear data up to about 20 MeV, and presently several million data points can be found in various data libraries. At higher energies, data are scarce or even non-existent. With the development of nuclear techniques based on neutrons at higher energies, nowadays there is a need also for higher-energy nuclear data. To provide alternative to this lack of data, a wide program on neutron-induced data related to ADS for P&#38;T is running at the 20–180 MeV neutron beam facility at `The Svedberg Laboratory' (TSL), Uppsala. The programme encompasses studies of elastic scattering, inelastic neutron production, i.e., ($n, xn^{'}$) reactions, light-ion production, fission and production of heavy residues. Recent results are presented and future program of development is outlined.</p>

					<p>The work is aimed at experimental determination of the independent and cumulative yields of radioactive residual nuclei produced in intermediate-energy proton-irradiated thin targets made of highly isotopic enriched and natural lead ($^{206,207,208,nat}$Pb) and $^{209}$Bi. 5972 radioactive product nuclide yields have been measured in 55 thin targets induced by $0.04, 0.07, 0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6$ and $2.6$ GeV protons extracted from the ITEP U-10 proton synchrotron. The measured data have been compared with data obtained at other laboratories as well as with theoretical simulations by seven codes. We found that the predictive power of the tested codes is different but is satisfactory for most of the nuclides in the spallation region, though none of the codes agree well with the data in the whole mass region of product nuclides and all should be improved further.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A beam of 1 GeV proton coming from Dubna Nuclotron colliding with a lead target surrounded by 6 cm paraffin produces spallation neutrons. A Th-foil was kept on lead target (neutron spallation source) in a direct stream of neutrons for activation and other samples of $^{197}$Au, $^{209}$Bi, $^{59}$Co, $^{115}$In and $^{181}$Ta were irradiated by moderated beam of neutrons passing through 6 cm paraffin moderator. The gamma spectra of irradiated samples were analyzed using gamma spectrometry and DEIMOS software to measure the neutron cross-section. For this purpose neutron fluence at the positions of samples is also estimated using PREPRO software. The results of cross-sections for reactions $^{232}$Th($n, \gamma$), $^{232}$Th($n, 2n$), $^{197}$Au($n, \gamma$), $^{197}$Au($n, \alpha$), $^{197}$Au($n, xn$), $^{59}$Co($n, \alpha$), $^{59}$Co($n, xn$), $^{181}$Ta($n, \gamma$) and $^{181}$Ta($n, xn$) are given in this paper. Neutronics validation of the Dubna Cascade Code is also done using cross-section data by other experiments.</p>

				<page>0315-0324</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dubna Cascade Code (version-2004) has been used for the Monte Carlo simulation of the 1500 MW$_{t}$ accelerator driven sub-critical system (ADS) with $^{233}$U $+$ $^{232}$Th fuel using the IAEA benchmark. Neutron spectrum, cross-section of $(n, xn)$ reactions, isotopic yield, heat spectra etc. are simulated. Many of these results that help in understanding the IAEA benchmark are presented. It is revealed that the code predicts the proton beam current required for the 1500 MW$_{t}$ ADS for $K_{\text{eff}} = 0.98$ to be 11.6 mA. Radial distribution of heat is fairly in agreement with other codes like the EA-MC and it needs nearly $1\%$ less enrichment than given by other codes. This may be because the code takes care of the role of larger order of the $(n, xn)$ reactions. It is emphasized that there is a strong need to study $(n, xn)$ reactions both theoretically and experimentally for better design.</p>

					<p>The paper discusses the basic design of the critical facility, whose main purpose is the physics validation of AHWR. Apart from moderator level control, the facility will have shutdown systems based on shutoff rods and multiple ranges of neutron detection systems. In addition, it will have a flux mapping system based on 25 fission chambers, distributed in the core. We are planning to use this reactor for experiments with a suitable source to simulate an ADS system. Any desired sub-criticality can be achieved by adjusting the moderator level. Apart from perfecting our experimental techniques, in simple configurations, we intend to study the one-way coupled core in this facility. Preliminary calculations, employing a Monte Carlo code TRIPOLI, are presented.</p>

					<p>At BARC, development of a Low Energy High Intensity Proton Accelerator (LEHIPA), as front-end injector of the 1 GeV accelerator for the ADS programme, has been initiated. The major components of LEHIPA (20 MeV, 30 mA) are a 50 keV ECR ion source, a 3 MeV Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and a 20 MeV drift tube linac (DTL). The Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) and Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) lines match the beam from the ion source to RFQ and from RFQ to DTL respectively. Design of these systems has been completed and fabrication of their prototypes has started. Physics studies of the 20{1000 MeV part of the Linac are also in progress. In this paper, the present status of this project is presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Department of Atomic Energy, India has taken up the development of ADS in view of many attractive features like inherent safety, capability to transmute large quantities of nuclear waste, better utilization of thorium etc. A roadmap has been finalized for the development of ADS. One of the key components of the ADS is the spallation target. Considering the neutron yield, thermal-hydraulics and radiation damage issues, we are proposing to develop spallation target based on heavy density liquid metals like lead and lead-bismuth-eutectic (LBE). Both window and windowless target configurations are presently being studied. In view of the various advantages we are also studying liquid metal flow circulation based on gas lift mechanism. An R&#38;D programme has been initiated to address various physics and technology issues of ADS target. Under this programme, mercury and LBE experimental facilities are presently being set up. Along with these facilities, computational tools related to spallation physics (FLUKA) and CFD are being developed, and the existing ones are utilized to design the entire target loop as well as sub-systems. In this presentation the details of these activities are presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>BARC has recently proposed a one-way coupled ADS reactor. This reactor requires typically $\sim 1$ GeV proton beam with 2 mA of current. Approximately 8 kW of heat is deposited in the window of the target. Circulating liquid metal target (lead/lead-bismuth-eutectic) has to extract this heat and this is a critical R&#38;D problem to be solved. At present there are very few accelerators, which can give few mA and high-energy proton beam. However, accelerators with low energy and hundreds of micro-ampere current are commercially available. In view of this, it is proposed in this paper to simulate beam window heating of $\sim 8$ kW in the target with low-energy proton beam. Detailed thermal analysis in the spallation and window region has been carried out to study the capability of heat extraction by circulating LBE for a typical target loop with a proton beam of 30 MeV energy and current of 0.267 mA. The heat deposition study is carried out using FLUKA code and flow analysis by CFD code. The detailed analysis of this work is presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>A numerical study of the target system of an ADSS with different flow guides</title>
				<feature>Proceedings of the Workshop on Physics of Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System for Energy and Transmutation (WP-ADS-E&#38;T)</feature>
				<page>0365-0376</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mechanical design of the target module of an accelerator driven sub-critical nuclear reactor system (ADSS) calls for an analysis of the related thermal-hydraulic issues because of large amount of heat deposition in the spallation region during the course of nuclear interactions with the molten lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) target. The LBE also should carry the entire heat generated as a consequence of the spallation reaction. The problem of heat removal by the LBE is a challenging thermal-hydraulic issue. For this, one has to examine the flows of low Prandtl number fluids (LBE) in a complex ADSS geometry. In this study, the equations governing the laminar flow and thermal energy are solved numerically using the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) finite element (FE) method. The target systems with a straight and a nozzle guide have been considered. The principal purpose of the analysis is to trace the flow and temperature distribution and thereby to check the suitability of the flow guide in avoiding the recirculation or stagnation zones in the flow space that may lead to hot spots.</p>

				<title>Effects of barrier fluctuation on the tunneling dynamics in the presence of classical chaos in a mixed quantum-classical system</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0377-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a numerical investigation of the tunneling dynamics of a particle moving in a bistable potential with fluctuating barrier which is coupled to a non-integrable classical system and study the interplay between classical chaos and barrier fluctuation in the tunneling dynamics. We found that the coupling of the quantum system with the classical subsystem decreases the tunneling rate irrespective of whether the classical subsystem is regular or chaotic and also irrespective of the fact that whether the barrier fluctuates or not. Presence of classical chaos always enhances the tunneling rate constant. The effect of barrier fluctuation on the tunneling rate in a mixed quantum-classical system is to suppress the tunneling rate. In contrast to the case of regular subsystem, the suppression arising due to barrier fluctuation is more visible when the subsystem is chaotic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The superdense stars with mass-to-size ratio exceeding 0.3 are expected to be made of strange matter. Assuming that the 3-space of the interior space-time of a strange star is that of a three-paraboloid immersed in a four-dimensional Euclidean space, we obtain a two-parameter family of their physically viable relativistic models. This ansatz determines density distribution of the interior self-gravitating matter up to one unknown parameter. The Einstein's field equations determine the fluid pressure and the remaining geometrical variables. The information about mass-to-size ratio together with the conventional boundary conditions lead to the determination of total mass, radius and other parameters of the stellar configuration.</p>

				<title>A study of daily variation in cosmic ray intensity during high/low amplitude days</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0407-0422</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed study has been conducted on the long-term changes in the diurnal, semi-diurnal and tri-diurnal anisotropies of cosmic rays in terms of the high/low amplitude anisotropic wave train events (HAE/LAE) during the period 1981-94 using the neutron monitor data from Deep River Neutron Monitoring Station. In all, 38 HAE and 28 LAE cases have been studied. An inter-comparison of the first three harmonics during these events has been made so as to understand the basic reason for the occurrence of these types of events. It has been observed that the phase of diurnal anisotropy shifts towards earlier hours for HAEs and it shifts towards earlier hour as compared to 18-h direction for LAEs. For semi-diurnal anisotropy, phase remains statistically the same for both HAE and LAE. In the case of tri-diurnal anisotropy, phase is evenly distributed for both types of events. The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind plasma (SWP) parameters during these events are also investigated. It has also been observed that HAE/LAEs are weakly dependent on high-speed solar wind velocity. The two types of solar wind streams (corotating streams and flare-generated streams) produce signi¯cant deviations in cosmic ray intensity during HAE/LAE.</p>

					<p>A new method is described to create secrete-codes in the security holograms for enhancing their anti-counterfeiting characteristics. To imitate these codes is difficult as pure phase objects having complex phase distribution function are used to modulate the object beam that is recorded in conjunction with an encoded interferometric reference beam derived from a key hologram. Lloyd's folding mirror interferometer is used to convert phase variations of the reconstructed wave-front into an intensity pattern for hologram authenticity verification. Creating the secrete-codes through an interferometric reference beam from the key hologram facilitates a multi-stage authenticity verification as well as easy repositioning of the security hologram through a specific Moiré pattern generated during the verification process.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of output coupler reflectivity (or output coupling ratio) on the performance of a linear cavity Brillouin/erbium fiber laser (BEFL) is demonstrated. The operating wavelength, output laser power and number of channels vary with changes in the coupling ratio in the linear cavity system. The optimum BEFL operation is obtained with an output coupling of $40\%$, i.e., $60\%$ of the laser power is allowed to oscillate in the cavity. A stable laser comb consisting of up to 40 channels with line spacings of approximately 0.09 nm are obtained at the Brillouin pump and 980 nm pump with powers of 2.5 mW and 100 mW, respectively. The linear cavity BEFL has the potential to be used in inexpensive wavelength division multiplexing system.</p>

				<title>Diffusion and transport phenomena in a collisional magnetoplasma having both streaming and temperature anisotropy: Collisional kinetics</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Boltzmann-transport equation is analytically solved for two-component magnetoplasma using Chapman-Enskog analysis to include collisional diffusion transport having anisotropies in both streaming velocity and temperature components. The modified collisional integrals are analytically solved with flux integrals and perturbed kinetic equation to arrive at drift diffusion velocity and resulting transport coefficients which are markedly affected by both streaming and temperature anisotropy. The early isotropic results are recovered in the limit $V_{0} = 0$ and $T_{\|} = T_{\bot}$ which reduce to eqs (11.30) and (11.31) of [1] and eqs (2.7) and (2.13) of [2]. The electrical resistivity (n_{\bot}) diminishes sharply in fusion temperature limit $kT_{\bot} = 1$ keV. The shape of the curves for both electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity is rectangular hyperbolic. However, for low thermal ratio $(T_{\|}/T_{\bot} &#60; 1)$, the curves are raised up and for high thermal ratio $(T_{\|}/T_{\bot} &#62; 1)$, they are lowered down the isotropic case $(T_{\|}/T_{\bot} &#62; 1)$, showing comparatively diminished magnitudes of the quantities.</p>

Both the ac-photoconductivity (ac-PC) and the spectral distribution of the photocurrent are studied in different values of light intensity, applied voltage and temperature. Dependencies of carrier lifetime on light intensity, applied voltage and temperature are also investigated as a result of the ac-PC measurements.

By group representation theory, the maximum number of non-vanishing and independent second- order piezoelectric coefficients required by the seven pentagonal and two icosahedral point groups - that describe the quasicrystal symmetry groups in two and three dimensions - is determined. The schemes of non-vanishing and independent second-order piezoelectric tensor components needed by the nine point groups with five-fold rotations are identified and tabulated employing a compact notation. The results of this group-theoretical study are briefly discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The stability of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene 2,5-diyl) (P3HT) thin films sandwiched between indium tin oxide (ITO) and aluminium (Al) electrodes have been investigated under normal environmental conditions ($25^{\circ}$C and RH$\sim 45-50\%$). Electrical and optical properties of ITO/P3HT/Al devices have been studied over a period of 30 days. Mobility $\mu$ of the order of $10^{-4}$ cm$^{2}$/V-s has been obtained from the $V^{2}$ law in the as- deposited P3HT ¯lms. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations show blistering of Al contacts in devices with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) interlayer on application of voltage whereas no blistering is seen in devices without PEDOT. The results have been explained in terms of trap generation and propagation and the moisture-absorbing nature of PEDOT.</p>

				<page>0499-0506</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The impurity displacements for Fe$^{3+}$ and Ru$^{3+}$ in corundum (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$) are theoretically studied using the perturbation formulas of the spin Hamiltonian parameters (zero-field splitting and anisotropic $g$ factors) for a 3d$^{5}$ (with high spin $S = 5/2$) and a 4d$^{5}$ (with low spin $S = 1/2$) ion in trigonal symmetry, respectively. According to the investigations, the nd$^{5}$ ($n = 3$ and 4) impurity ions may not locate at the ideal Al$^{3+}$ site but undergo axial displacements by about 0.132 Å and 0.170 Å for Fe$^{3+}$ and Ru$^{3+}$, respectively, away from the center of the ligand octahedron along the C$_{3}$ axis. The calculated spin Hamiltonian parameters based on the above axial displacements show good agreement with the observed values. The validity of the results is discussed.</p>

				<title>Contribution of backscattered electrons to the total electron yield produced in collisions of 8–28 keV electrons with tungsten</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0507-0515</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is shown experimentally that under energetic electron bombardment the backscattered electrons from solid targets contribute significantly ($\sim 80\%$) to the observed total electron yield, even for targets of high backscattering coefficients. It is further found that for tungsten ($Z = 74$) with a backscattering coefficient of about 0.50, about $20\%$ of the total electron yield is contributed by the total secondary electrons for impact energies in the range of 8–28 keV. The yield of true backscattered electrons at normal incidence ($\eta_{0}$), total secondary electrons ($\delta$) and the total electron yield ($\delta_{\text{tot}}) produced in collisions of 8–28 keV electrons with W have been measured and compared with predictions of available theories. The present results indicate that the constant-loss of primary electrons in the target plays a significant role in producing the secondary electrons and that it yields a better fit to the experiment compared to the power-law.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0517-0528</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The energy and angular distributions of backscattered electrons produced under the impact of 5 keV electrons with thick Al, Ti, Ag, W and Pt targets are measured. The energy range of backscattered electrons is considered between $E_{B}$ = 50$ eV and 5000 eV. The angle of incidence α and take-off angle $\theta$ are chosen to have values $\alpha = 0^{\circ}$ and $10^{\circ}$ and $\theta = 100^{\circ}$, $110^{\circ}$ and $120^{\circ}$ respectively. The measured energy spectra are compared with the available theoretical models for $\alpha = 0^{\circ}$ and $10^{\circ}$. The elastic peak intensity of backscattered electrons is found to be a function of angle of incidence, take-off angle and atomic number of the target material. The considered theories are reasonably in good agreement with experiment for the energy spectra of the backscattered electrons having their reduced energies $\epsilon (= E_{B}/E_{0})$ in the range of 0.20 to 1.00.</p>

				<title>Systematic study of spatiotemporal dynamics of intense femtosecond laser pulses in BK-7 glass</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0547-0569</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we present a systematic study of the spatial and temporal effects of intense femtosecond laser pulses in BK-7 over a broad range of input powers, 1–1000 times the critical power for self-focusing ($P_{cr}$) by numerically solving the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS). Most numerical studies have not been extended to such high  powers. A clear-cut classification of spatio-temporal dynamics up to very high powers into three regimes – the group-velocity dispersion (GVD) regime, the ionization regime and the dominant plasma regime – as done here, is a significant step towards a better understanding. Further, we examine in detail the role of GVD in channel formation by comparing BK-7 to an `artificial' medium. Our investigations bring forth the important observation that diffraction plays a minimal role in the formation of multiple cones and that plasma plays a diffraction-like role at very high powers. A detailed study of the spatio-temporal dynamics in any condensed medium over this range of powers has not been reported hitherto, to the best of our knowledge. We also suggest appropriate operational powers for various applications employing BK-7 on the basis of our results.</p>

				<title>An alternative method to specify the degree of resonator stability</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0571-0580</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present an alternative method to specify the stability of real stable resonators. We introduce the degree of optical stability or the $S$ parameter, which specify the stability of resonators in a numerical scale ranging from 0 to $100\%$. The value of zero corresponds to marginally stable resonator and $S &#60; 0$ corresponds to unstable resonator. Also, three definitions of the S parameter are provided: in terms of $A&#38;D$, $B&#38;Z_{\text{R0}}$ and $g_{1}g_{2}$. It may be noticed from the present formalism that the maximum degree of stability with $S = 1$ automatically corresponds to $g_{1}g_{2} = 1/2$. We also describe the method to measure the $S$ parameter from the output beam characteristics and $B$ parameter. A possible correlation between the $S$ parameter and the misalignment tolerance is also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Within the framework of boundary diffraction wave theory it has been shown that the first bright fringe on either side of the central dark fringe of the phase knife-edge Fresnel diffraction pattern could be broadened to cover the whole field of view. Broadening of the first diffraction fringe, instead of conventionally modifying the spatial frequency spectrum, enhances the sensitivity of the Schlieren system. The use of phase knife-edge as viewing diaphragm in Schlieren diffraction interferometry not only enhances the fringe contrast but also avoids the loss in phase information as it lets through light from all parts of the test object and its thin interfacing makes the method suitable even for studying weak disturbances.</p>

				<title>A method for calculating active feedback system to provide vertical position control of plasma in a tokamak</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0591-0602</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In designing tokamaks, the maintenance of vertical stability of plasma is one of the most important problems. Systems of the passive and active feedbacks are applied for this purpose. Role of the passive system consisting of a vacuum vessel and passive coils is to suppress fast MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) instabilities. The active feedback system is applied to control slow motions of plasma.</p>
					<p>The objective of the paper is to investigate two successive problems, solution of which allows to determine the possibility of controlling plasma motions. One of these is the problem of vertical stability under the assumption of ideal conductivity of plasma and passive stabilizing elements. The problem is solved analytically and on the basis of the obtained solution a criterion of MHD-stability is formulated. The other problem is connected with the control of plasma vertical position with active feedback system. Calculation of feedback control parameters is formulated as an optimization problem and an approximate method to solve the problem is suggested. Numerical simulations are performed with parameters of the T-15M tokamak in order to justify the suggested method.</p>

				<title>Effect of upflowing field-aligned electron beams on the electron cyclotron waves in the auroral magnetosphere</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0611-0622</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The role of low density upflowing field-aligned electron beams (FEBs) on the growth rate of the electron cyclotron waves at the frequencies $\omega_{r} &#60; \Omega_{­e}$, propagating downward in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, has been analysed in the auroral region at $\omega_{e} / \Omega_{e} &#60; 1$ where $\omega_{e}$ is the plasma frequency and $\Omega_{­e}$ is the gyrofrequency. The FEBs with low to high energy ($E_{b}$) but with low temperature ($T_{\| b}$) have no effect on these waves. The FEBs with $E_{b} &#60; 1$ keV and $T_{\| b} ($&#62; 1.5$ keV) have been found to have significant effect on the growth rate. Analysis has revealed that it is mainly the $T_{\| b}$ which inhibits the growth rate (magnitude) and the range of frequency (bandwidth) of the instability mainly in the higher frequency spectrum. The inhibition in the growth rate and bandwidth increases with increase in $T_{\| b}$. The FEBs with less $E_{b}$ (giving drift velocity) reduce growth rate more than the beams with larger $E_{b}$. The inhibition of growth rate increases with the increase in the ratio $\omega_{e}/ \Omega_{e}$ indicating that the beams are more effective at higher altitudes.</p>

					<p>Polyester fabric is treated with DCDMS solution by two methods: dipping the fabric directly in DCDMS solution for different intervals and dipping the fabric in DCDMS solution after its exposure into RF plasma chamber for different durations at optimized exposure power conditions. The physical properties of polyester fabric treated with DCDMS in the presence or absence of air plasma have been compared with control fabric. Different characterization techniques like scanning electron microscope, attenuated total reflectance-IR and Dataflash 100 colour measurement spectrophotometer are used to assess the surface morphology, composition and change in colour parameters. Water repellency property of both untreated and modified polyester fabric is studied using AATCC test method 39 (1971). The effectiveness of the water repellency property of modified polyester fabric is checked by repeated washing up to ten cycles.</p>

				<title>Application of inertia-induced excitation theory for nonlinear acoustic modes in colloidal plasma equilibrium flow</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0631-0648</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Application of inertia-induced acoustic excitation theory offers a new resonant excitation source channel of acoustic turbulence in the transonic domain of plasma flow. In bi-ion plasmas like colloidal plasma, two well-defined transonic points exist corresponding to the parent ion and the dust grain-associated acoustic modes. As usual, the modified ion acoustic mode (also known as dust ion-acoustic (DIA) wave) dynamics associated with parent ion inertia is excitable for both nanoscale- and micronscale-sized dust grains. It is found that the so-called (ion) acoustic mode (also known as dust-acoustic (DA) wave) associated with nanoscale dust grain inertia is indeed resonantly excitable through the active role of weak but finite parent ion inertia. It is interestingly conjectured that the same excitation physics, as in the case of normal plasma sound mode, operates through the active inertial role of plasma thermal species. Details of the nonlinear acoustic mode analyses of current interest in transonic domains of such impure plasmas in hydrodynamic flow are presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present here a systematic investigation of the atomic displacements in bcc transition metal (TM) dilute alloys. We have calculated the atomic displacements in bcc (V, Cr, Fe, Nb, Mo, Ta and W) transition metals (TMs) due to 3d, 4d and 5d TMs at the substitutional site using the Kanzaki lattice static method. Wills and Harrison interatomic potential is used to calculate the atomic force constants, the dynamical matrix and the impurity-induced forces. We have thoroughly investigated the atomic displacements using  impurities from 3d, 4d and 5d series in the same host metal and the same impurity in different hosts. We have observed a systematic pattern in the atomic displacements for Cr-, Fe-, Nb-, Mo-, Ta- and W-based dilute alloys. The atomic displacements are found to increase with increase in the number of d electrons for all alloys considered except for V dilute alloys. The 3d impurities are found to be more easily dissolved in the 3d host metals than 4d or 5d TMs whereas 4d and 5d impurities show more solubility in 4d and 5d TMs. In general, the relaxation energy calculation suggests that impurities may be easily solvable in 5d TM hosts when compared to 3d or 4d TMs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mn$^{2+}$-doped ZnS nanoparticles were prepared by chemical arrested precipitation method. The samples were heated at 300, 500, 700 and $900^{\circ}$C. The average particle size was determined from the X-ray line broadening. Samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR and UV. The composition was verified by EDAX spectrum. The hexagonal structure of the sample was identified. The size of the particles increased as the annealing temperature was increased. The crystallite size varied from 5 nm to 34 nm as the calcination temperature increased. At around $700^{\circ}$C, ZnS is converted into ZnO phase due to oxidation. The emission peak of the sample is observed at 300 nm resulting in blue emission. The solid state theory based on the delocalized electron and hole within the confined volume can explain the blue-shifted optical absorption spectra. UV-VIS spectro-photometric measurement shows an indirect allowed band gap of 3.65 eV.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0689-0699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The damage spreading of the Ising model on three kinds of networks is studied with Glauber dynamics. One of the networks is generated by evolving the hexagonal lattice with the star-triangle transformation. Another kind of network is constructed by connecting the midpoints of the edges of the topological hexagonal lattice. With the evolution of these structures, damage spreading transition temperature increases and a general explanation for this phenomenon is presented from the view of the network. The relationship between the transition temperature and the network measure-clustering coefficient is set up and it is shown that the increase of damage spreading transition temperature is the result of more and more clustering of the network. We construct the third kind of network-random graphs with Poisson degree distributions by changing the average degree of the network. We show that the increase in the average degree is equivalent to the clustering of nodes and this leads to the increase in damage spreading transition temperature.</p>

				<title>Bianchi Type-II inﬂationary models with constant deceleration parameter in general relativity</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0707-0720</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Einstein's ﬁeld equations are considered for a locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi Type-II space–time in the presence of a massless scalar ﬁeld with a scalar potential. Exact solutions of scale factors and other physical parameters are obtained by using a special law of variation for Hubble's parameter that yields a constant value of deceleration parameter. To get inﬂationary solutions, a ﬂat region is considered in which the scalar potential is constant. Power-law and exponential cases are studied and in both solutions there is an anisotropic expansion of the cosmic ﬂuid, but the ﬂuid has vanishing vorticity. A detailed study of geometrical and kinematical properties of solutions has been carried out.</p>

				<title>On the relative energy associated with space-times of diagonal metrics</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0735-0748</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to evaluate the energy distribution (due to matter and ﬁelds including gravitation) associated with a space-time model of generalized diagonal metric, we consider the Einstein, Bergmann–Thomson and Landau–Lifshitz energy and/or momentum deﬁnitions both in Einstein's theory of general relativity and the teleparallel gravity (the tetrad theory of gravitation). We ﬁnd same energy distribution using Einstein and Bergmann–Thomson formulations, but we also ﬁnd that the energy–momentum prescription of Landau–Lifshitz disagree in general with these deﬁnitions. We also give eight different well-known space-time models as examples, and considering these models and using our results, we calculate the energy distributions associated with them. Furthermore, we show that for the Bianchi Type-I models all the formulations give the same result. This result agrees with the previous works of Cooperstock–Israelit, Rosen, Johri {\textit{et al}}, Banerjee–Sen, Xulu, Vargas and Saltı {\textit{et al}} and supports the viewpoints of Albrow and Tryon.</p>

				<title>Synchronization and basin bifurcations in mutually coupled oscillators</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0749-0756</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synchronization behaviour of two mutually coupled double-well Duffig oscillators exhibiting cross-well chaos is examined. Synchronization of the subsystems was observed for coupling strength $k &#62; 0.4$. It is found that when the oscillators are operated in the regime for which two attractors coexist in phase space, basin bifurcation sequences occur leading to $n + 1$, $n \geq 2$ basins as the coupling is varied – a signature of Wada structure and ﬁnal-state sensitivity. However, in the region of complete synchronization, the basins structure is identical with that of the single oscillators and retains its essential features including fractal basin boundaries.</p>

				<page>0757-0768</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We calculate the interfacial surface tension of a QGP-ﬁreball in a hadronic medium in the Ramanathan {\textit{et al}} statistical model. The constancy of the ratio of the surface tension with the cube of the critical transition temperature is in overall accordance with lattice QCD ﬁndings. It is in complete agreement with a recent MIT bag model calculation of surface tension. The velocity of sound in the QGP droplet is predicted to be in the range $(0.27 \pm 0.02)$ times the velocity of light in vacuum and this value is independent of both the value of the transition temperature and the model parameters.</p>

				<title>Microscopic interacting boson model calculations for even–even $^{128−138}$Ce nuclei</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0769-0778</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, we determined the most appropriate Hamiltonian that is needed for the present calculations of energy levels and $B(E2)$ values of $^{128−138}$Ce nuclei which have a mass around $A \cong 130$ using the interacting boson model (IBM). Using the best-ﬁtted values of parameters in the Hamiltonian of the IBM-2, we have calculated energy levels and $B(E2)$ values for a number of transitions in $^{128,130,132,134,136,138}$Ce. The results were compared with the previous experimental and theoretical (PTSM model) data and it was observed that they are in good agreement. Also some predictions of this model have better accuracy than those of PTSM model. It has turned out that the interacting  boson approximation (IBA) is fairly reliable for calculating spectra in the entire set of $^{128,130,132,134,136,138}$Ce isotopes and the quality of the ﬁts presented in this paper is acceptable.</p>

				<title>One-neutron stripping reactions of $^{11}$Be and $^{19}$C on light target</title>

				<page>0779-0787</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have calculated the one-neutron absorption cross-section and the longitudinal momentum distribution of the core fragment coming out from the breakup of $^{11}$Be and $^{19}$C on $^{9}$Be target at 63 MeV/A and 88 MeV/A beam energies respectively. The reaction mechanism is treated within the framework of the eikonal approximation. The effective range of the nuclear interaction between the core and the valence neutron within the projectile has been determined by comparing the predicted stripping crosssection  with the recently measured one. The eﬀective range for $^{19}$C has been found to besmaller than that for $^{11}$Be. It qualitatively indicates that $^{19}$C is slightly more halo than $^{11}$Be. The smaller width, predicted as well as measured, of the LMD of $^{18}$C than $^{10}$Be also strengthens this fact. The experimental data concerning the LMD of core fragments have been well represented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A self-affne analysis of charged-particle multiplicity distribution (protons $+$ pions) in $\pi^{−}$ –AgBr interaction at 350 GeV/c is performed according to the two-dimensional factorial moment methodology using the concept of Hurst exponent in $X_{\cos \theta^{-}} $X_{\phi}$ phase space. Comparing with the results obtained from self-similar analysis, the self affine analysis shows a better power-law behaviour. Corresponding results are compared with shower multiplicity distribution (pions). Multifractal behaviour is observed for both types of distributions.</p>

				<title>Stress and mixed boundary conditions for two-dimensional dodecagonal quasi-crystal plates</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0803-0817</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For plate bending and stretching problems in two-dimensional (2D) dodecagonal quasi-crystal (QC) media, the reciprocal theorem and the general solution for QCs are applied in a novel way to obtain the appropriate stress and mixed boundary conditions accurate to all order. The method developed by Gregory and Wan is used to generate necessary conditions which the prescribed data on the edge of the plate must satisfy in order that it should generate a decaying state within the plate; these decaying  state conditions are obtained explicitly for axisymmetric bending and stretching of a circular plate when stress or mixed conditions are imposed on the plate edge. They are then used for the correct formulation of boundary conditions for the interior solution. For the stress data, our boundary conditions coincide with those obtained in conventional forms of plate theories. More importantly, appropriate boundary conditions with a set of mixed edge-data are obtained for the ﬁrst time. Furthermore, the corresponding necessary conditions for transversely isotropic elastic plate are obtained directly, and their isotropic elastic counterparts are also obtained.</p>

				<title>Hartree–Fock variational bounds for ground state energy of chargeless fermions with ﬁnite magnetic moment in the presence of a hard core potential: A stable ferromagnetic state</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0819-0830</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We use different determinantal Hartree–Fock (HF) wave functions to calculate true variational upper bounds for the ground state energy of $N$ spin-half fermions in volume $V_{0}$, with mass $m$, electric charge zero, and magnetic moment $\mu$, interacting through magnetic dipole–dipole interaction. We ﬁnd that at high densities when the average interparticle distance $r_{0}$ becomes small compared to the magnetic length $r_{m} \equiv 2m\mu^{2}/\hbar^{2}$, a ferromagnetic state with spheroidal occupation function $n_{\uparrow} (\vec{k})$, involving quadrupolar deformation, gives a lower upper bound compared to the variational energy for the uniform paramagnetic state or for the state with dipolar deformation. This system is unstable towards inﬁnite density collapse, but we show explicitly that a suitable short-range repulsive (hard core) interaction of strength $U_{0}$ and range a can stop this collapse. The existence of a stable equilibrium high density ferromagnetic state with spheroidal occupation function is possible as long as the ratio of coupling constants $\Gamma_{cm} \equiv (U_{0}a^{3}/\mu^{2})$ is not very smallcompared to 1.</p>

					<p>Dielectric relaxation measurements of formamide (FMD)–$N,N$- dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) solvent mixtures have been carried out over the entire concentration range using time domain reﬂectometry technique at 25, 35 and $45^{\circ}$ C in thefrequency range of 10 MHz to 20 GHz. The mixtures exhibit a principle dispersion of the Davidson–Cole relaxation type at microwave frequencies. Bilinear calibration method is used to obtain complex permittivity $\epsilon^{∗}(\omega)$ from complex reﬂection coefficient $\rho^{∗} (\omega)$ over the frequency range of 10 MHz to 10 GHz.

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum effects which have usually been associated with micro-scale phenomena can also arise on the macro-scale in situations other than the well-known macro-quantum phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity. Such situations have been shown here to arise in processes involving inelastic scattering with bound or partially bound systems (not bound in all degrees of freedom), and the macro-quantum behaviour is associated with the state of the total system in transition in the process of scattering. Such a state is designated as a `transition-state'. It is pointed out that we have already observed such manifestations for a particular system, the charged particles in a magnetic field where interference effects involving macro-scale matter waves along the magnetic field have been reported [R K Varma {\textit{et al, Phys.

				<page>0931-0941</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We explore the possibility of distinguishing the SM-like MSSM Higgs boson from the SM Higgs boson via Higgs boson pair production at future muon collider. We study the behavior of the production cross-section in SM and MSSM with Higgs boson mass for various MSSM parameters tan $\beta$ and $m_{A}$. We observe that at fixed CM energy, in the SM, the total cross-section increases with the increase in Higgs boson mass whereas this trend is reversed for the MSSM. The changes that occur for the MSSM in comparison to the SM predictions are quantified in terms of the relative percentage deviation in cross-section. The observed deviations in cross-section for different choices of Higgs boson masses suggest that the measurements of the cross-section could possibly distinguish the SM-like MSSM Higgs boson from the SM Higgs boson.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The $\Lambda \Lambda$ binding energy ($B_{\Lambda \Lambda}) of the s- and p-shell hypernuclei are calculated variationally in the cluster model and multidimensional integrations are performed using Monte Carlo. A variety of phenomenological $\Lambda$-core potentials consistent with the $\Lambda$-core energies and a wide range of simulated s-state $\Lambda \Lambda$ potentials are taken as input. The $B_{\Lambda \Lambda} of $_{\Lambda \Lambda} ^{6}$He is explained and $_{\Lambda \Lambda} ^{5}$He and $_{\Lambda \Lambda} ^{5}$H are predicted to be particle stable in the $\Lambda \Lambda$-core model. The results for s-shell hypernuclei are in excellent agreement with those of non-VMC calculations. The $_{\Lambda \Lambda}^{10}$Be in $\Lambda \Lambda \alpha \alpha$ model is overbound for combinations of $\Lambda \Lambda$ and $\Lambda \alpha$ potentials. A phenomenological dispersive three-body force, $V_{\Lambda \alpha \alpha}$, consistent with the $B_{\Lambda} of $_{\Lambda}^{9}$Be in the $\Lambda \alpha \alpha$ model underbinds $_{\Lambda \Lambda}^{10}$Be. The incremental $\Delta B_{\Lambda \Lambda}$ values for the s- and p-shell cannot be reconciled, consistent with the finding of earlier analyses.</p>

					<p>A new empirical four-parameter function is proposed for the construction of potential curves of 15 stable states of diatomic molecules.

				<title>Exact solution of the classical mechanical quadratic Zeeman effect</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0967-0982</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We address the curious problem of quadratic Zeeman effect at the classical mechanical level. The problem has been very well understood for decades, but an analytical solution of the equations of motion is still to be found. This state of affairs persists because the simultaneous presence of the Coulombic and quadratic terms lowers the dynamical symmetry. Energy and orbital angular momentum are still constants of motion. We find the exact solutions by introducing the concept of an image ellipse. The quadratic effect leads to a dilation of space–time, and a one-to-one correspondence is observed for pairs of physical quantities like energy and angular momentum, and the maximum and minimum distances from the Coulomb center for the Zeeman orbit and the corresponding pairs for the image ellipse. Thus, instead of finding additional conserved quantities, we find constants of motion for an additional dynamics, namely, the image problem. The trajectory is open, in agreement with Bertrand's theorem, but necessarily bound. A stable unbound trajectory does not exist for real values of energy and angular momentum. The radial distance, the angle covered in the plane of the orbit, and the time are uniquely determined by introducing further the concept of an image circle. While the radial distance is defined in a closed form as a transcendental function of the image-circular angle, the corresponding orbit angle and time variables are found in the form of two convergent series expansions. The latter two variables are especially contracted, thereby leading to a precession of the open cycles around the Coulomb center. It is expected that the space–time dilation effect observed here would somehow influence the solution of the quantum mechanical problem at the non-relativistic level.</p>

				<title>A high resolution X-ray crystal spectrometer to study electron and heavy-ion impact atomic collisions</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0983-0994</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied fast ion–atom and electron–atom collision processes using a reconditioned high resolution X-ray spectrometer. The X-rays, generated by the collisions, are dispersed by a curved ADP crystal (Johansson geometry) and detected by a gas proportional counter. A self-written LabVIEW based program has been used to give precise and controlled movement to the crystal and for data acquisition. The performance was tested by detecting the K$\alpha$ diagram and satellite lines of several elements. The K$\alpha$ satellite lines of Al have been studied in collision with 3–12 keV electrons and 40 MeV C$^{4+}$ ions. In ion collisions as large as four L-vacancies are created simultaneously with the K-vacancy, compared to two satellites in case of the e-impact. In addition, we have measured the X-rays from H-, He- and Li-like Si ions which arise due to the electron loss/capture process in highly charged 80 MeV Si$^{7+}$ ions in collision with thin carbon foil. Approximate charge state distribution has been obtained using this new technique.</p>

					<p>Linear electro-optical tensor coefficients and optical susceptibility of tetragonal KNbO$_{3}$ are calculated using a formalism based on bond charge theory. Results are in close agreement with the experimental data. The covalent Nb–O bonding network comprising the distorted NbO$_{6}$ octahedral groups in the structure is found to be a major contributor to the electro-optic coefficients making these groups more sensitive to these properties than the KO$_{12}$ groups. The orientations of the chemical bonds play an important role in determining these properties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The cosmic ray (CR) intensity data recorded in Deep River Neutron Monitoring Station have been investigated on quietest days (QD) for third harmonics of daily variation during solar cycles 21 and 22. It has been observed that in spite of abrupt change in the amplitude and phase of tri-diurnal anisotropy in CR intensity, the amplitude is quite significant throughout the period of investigation with larger amplitude during the years 1980 and 1985. Thus, tri-diurnal anisotropy clearly shows 11-year variation at the mid latitude neutron monitoring station.</p>

					<p>The Hartree–Bogoliubov (HB) framework of calculations has been applied for calculating various nuclear structure quantities for $^{154−166}$Dy mass chains. In this framework, the intrinsic quadrupole moments, the low-lying yrast states ($E_{2}^{+}$ and $E_{4}^{+}$) and occupation numbers for various shell model orbits have been obtained.

				<page>0031-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inspired by Raychaudhuri's work, and using the equation named after him as a basic ingredient, a new singularity theorem is proved. Open non-rotating Universes, expanding everywhere with a non-vanishing spatial average of the matter variables, show severe geodesic incompletness in the past. Another way of stating the result is that, under the same conditions, any singularity-free model must have a vanishing spatial average of the energy density (and other physical variables). This is very satisfactory and provides a clear decisive difference between singular and non-singular cosmologies.</p>

					<p>We present a brief review on the Raychaudhuri equations. Beginning with a summary of the essential features of the original article by Raychaudhuri and subsequent work of numerous authors, we move on to a discussion of the equations in the context of alternate non-Riemannian spacetimes as well as other theories of gravity, with a special mention on the equations in spacetimes with torsion (Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory). Finally, we give an overview of some recent applications of these equations in general relativity, quantum field theory, string theory and the theory of relativisitic membranes. We conclude with a summary and provide our own perspectives on directions of future research.</p>

					<p>In general relativity space-like or null singularities are common: they imply that `time' can have a beginning or end. Well-known examples are singularities inside black holes and initial or final singularities in expanding or contracting universes. In recent times, string theory is providing new perspectives of such singularities which may lead to an understanding of these in the standard framework of time evolution in quantum mechanics. In this article, we describe some of these approaches.</p>

					<p>We consider here the genericity aspects of spacetime singularities that occur in cosmology and in gravitational collapse. The singularity theorems (that predict the occurrence of singularities in general relativity) allow the singularities of gravitational collapse to be either visible to external observers or covered by an event horizon of gravity.

In the present article, taking into account QED vacuum polarization, we study the propagation of a bundle of rays in a background gravitational field through the perturbative deformation of Raychaudhuri's equation. In a sense, this could be seen as another semiclassical study in which geometry is treated classically but matter (which means the photon here) is allowed to exhibit quantum characteristics that are encoded in its coupling to the background curvature.</p>

					<p>We calculate the $q\bar{q}$ pair production probability in the colour-flux tube model by considering the effect of non-Abelian interactions in the theory. Non-Abelian interactions in the colour field are time-dependent and hence should oscillate with a characteristic frequency $\omega_{0}$ , which depends on the amplitude of the field strength. Using the WKB approximation in complex time, we calculated the pair production probability. When the strength of the field is comparable to the quark masses, the corresponding pair creation probability is maximum, and for the static field $w_{0} \rightarrow 0$, we recovered the well-known Schwinger result.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The theoretical and experimental investigations of the penetration of charged particles in matter played a very important role in the development of modern physics. Solid state nuclear track detectors have become one of the most important tools for many branches of science and technology. An attempt has been made to examine the suitability of the single-sheet particle identification technique in CR-39 and CN-85 polycarbonate by plotting track cone length vs. residual range for different heavy ions in these detectors. So, the maximum etchable ranges of heavy ions such as $^{93}$Nb, $^{86}$Kr and $^{4}$He in CR-39 and $^{4}$He and $^{132}$Xe in CN-85 polycarbonate have been determined. The ranges of these ions in these detectors have also been computed theoretically using the Henke–Benton program. A reasonably good agreement has been observed between the experimentally and theoretically computed values.</p>

Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr were chosen as secondary exciters. 59.5 keV $\gamma$-rays emitted from a $^{241}$Am annular source were used to excite a secondary exciter and K$_{\alpha}$ (K-L$_{3}$, L$_{2}$) lines emitted by the secondary exciter were counted by a Si(Li) detector with a resolution of 160 eV at 5.9 keV. It was observed that mixture rule method is not a suitable method for determination of the mass attenuation coefficients of compounds, especially at an energy that is near the absorption edge.

				<title>Single-photon all-optical switching using coupled microring resonators</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0219-0228</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study the nonlinear phase response of a microring resonator coupled to a bus waveguide and the use of this nonlinear phase shift to store information in the microring resonator and enhance the switching characteristics of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI). By introducing coupling between adjacent microring resonators, the switching characteristics of the MZI can be exponentially enhanced as a function of the number of microring resonators, when compared to the linear enhancement for uncoupled resonators. With only a few moderate-finesse microring resonators, the switching power can be reduced to attowatt level, allowing for photonic switching devices that operate at single-photon level in ordinary optical waveguides.</p>

				<page>0229-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nonlinear Schrödinger equation which governs the dynamics of two-dimensional spatial solitons in Kerr media with periodically varying diffraction and nonlinearity has been analyzed in this paper using variational approach and numerical studies. Analytical expressions for soliton parameters have been derived using variational analysis. Variational equations and partial differential equation have been simulated numerically. Analytical and numerical studies have shown that nonlinearity management and diffraction management stabilize the pulse against decay or collapse providing undisturbed propagation even for larger energies of the incident beam.</p>

				<title>Propagation of ion-acoustic waves in a dusty plasma with non-isothermal electrons</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0241-0253</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For an unmagnetised collisionless plasma consisting of warm ions, non-isothermal electrons and cold, massive and charged dust grains, the Sagdeev potential equation, considering both ion dynamics and dust dynamics has been derived. It has been observed that the Sagdeev potential $V (\phi)$ exists only for $\phi &#62; 0$ up to an upper limit $(\phi \simeq 1.2)$. This implies the possibility of existence of compressive solitary wave in the plasma. Exhaustive numerics done for both the large-amplitude and small-amplitude ion-acoustic waves have revealed that various parameters, namely, ion temperature, non-isothermality of electrons, Mach numbers etc. have considerable impact on the amplitude as well as the width of the solitary waves. Dependence of soliton profiles on the ion temperature and the Mach number has also been graphically displayed. Moreover, incorporating dust-charge fluctuation and non-isothermality of electrons, a non-linear equation relating the grain surface potential to the electrostatic potential has been derived. It has been solved numerically and interdependence of the two potentials for various ion temperatures and orders of non-isothermality has been shown graphically.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0255-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The density functional theory (DFT) is used to study the atomic interactions in transition metal-based interstitial alloys. The strain field is calculated in the discrete lattice model using Kanzaki method. The total energy and hence atomic forces between interstitial hydrogen and transition metal hosts are calculated using DFT. The norm-conserving pseudopotentials for H, Cu and Pd are generated self-consistently. The dynamical matrices are evaluated considering interaction up to first nearest neighbors whereas impurity-induced forces are calculated with M$_{32}$H shell (where M = Cu and Pd). The atomic displacements produced by interstitial hydrogen at the octahedral site in Cu and Pd show displacements of $7.36\%$ and $4.3\%$ of the first nearest neighbors respectively. Both Cu and Pd lattices show lattice expansion due to the presence of hydrogen and the obtained average lattice expansion $\Delta V /V = 0.177$ for Cu and 0.145 for Pd.</p>

					<p>An experimental study of proximity effect in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$–YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7}$–La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ trilayers is reported. Transport measurements on these samples show clear oscillations in critical current ($I_{c}$) as the thickness of La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ layers ($d_{F}$) is scanned from $\sim 50$ Å to $\sim 1100$ Å. In the light of existing theories of ferromagnet–superconductor (FM–SC) heterostructures, this observation suggests a long range proximity effect in the manganite, modulated by its weak exchange energy ($\sim 2$ meV). The observed modulation of the magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic LSMO layers as a function of $d_{F}$, also suggests an oscillatory behavior of the SC order parameter near the FM–SC interface.</p>

					<p>This paper reports a systematic investigation of the growth and attachment of small gold nanoparticles to the functionalized surface of larger silica nanoparticles by three different methods. Nearly monodispersed silica particles and gold nanoparticles were prepared by sol–gel method. The size of the particle could be altered by changing the concentration of reactants, temperature and the time for which they react. The nanocore-shell particles prepared by three different methods were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV–vis spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We have found that the third method (c), a combination of the first two methods (a) and (b), has given better results.</p>

				<title>Equation of state for inert gas solids</title>
				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0307-0312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The equation of state is a fundamental relation to analyse the thermophysical properties of different class of solids and it plays a key role in basic and applied condensed matter physics research. A lot of work has been done in the field of ionic solids, minerals and metals but a very little work is done in the field of inert gas solids. Most of the equations of state failed to explain the properties of inert gas solid because of their abnormal behavior in the low temperature range. In the present paper, Singh–Gupta equation of state has been used to study the properties of these solids. The results obtained using these equations have shown a good agreement with available experimental results. Thus it is shown that these equations of states successfully explain the behavior of inert gas solids.</p>

The special case pertaining to the geometric phase in $N$-level systems is described in detail.

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study the performance of double gap RPC has been tested by GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation code. The detector response calculations taken as a function of the neutron energy in the range of 0.01 eV–1 GeV have been simulated through RPC set-up. In order to evaluate the response of detector in the LHC background environment, the neutron spectrum expected in the CMS muon endcap and barrel region were taken into account. A hit rate of about 165.5 Hz cm$^{−2}$, 34 Hz cm$^{−2}$, 33.6 Hz cm$^{−2}$, and 27.0 Hz cm$^{−2}$ due to an isotropic neutron source is calculated using GEANT4 standard electromagnetic package for a $20 \times 20$ cm$^{2}$ RPC in the ME1, ME2, ME3 and ME4, respectively. While for the same neutron source and using GEANT4 package a hit rate of about 0.42 Hz cm$^{−2}$, 0.7182 Hz cm$^{−2}$ was measured for the MB1 and MB4 stations respectively. Similar characteristics of hit rates have been observed for GEANT4 low electromagnetic package.</p>

				<title>Optical parametric amplification beyond the slowly varying amplitude approximation</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0395-0409</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The coupled-wave equations describing optical parametric amplification (OPA) are usually solved in the slowly varying amplitude (SVA) approximation regime, in which the second-order derivatives of the signal and idler amplitudes are ignored and in fact the electromagnetic effects due to exit face of the medium is not involved. Here, an analytical plane-wave solution of these coupled-wave equations in a non-absorbing medium is presented. The solutions are derived beyond the SVA approximation up to order of $\kappa = k$ (coupling constant over the wave number). The intensity distributions of the signal and the idler waves show a periodic behavior about their corresponding distributions of SVA-adapted solution. This behavior can be explained by the interference of the forward propagating signal (idler) wave and the corresponding backward one resulted from the reflection by the end face of the medium. Furthermore, this interference pattern in the medium can in turn serve as a periodic source for the next generations of the signal and idler waves. Therefore, the superposition of the waves, generated from different points of this periodic source, at the exit face of the medium shows an oscillatory behavior of the transmitted signal (idler) wave in terms of normalized coupling constant, $\kappa L$. This study also shows that this effect is more considerable for high intensity pump beam, high relative refractive index and short length of the nonlinear medium.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nanoﬂuids are a new class of heat transfer ﬂuids developed by suspending  nanosized solid particles in liquids. Larger thermal conductivity of solid particles compared to the base ﬂuid such as water, ethylene glycol, engine oil etc. signiﬁcantly enhances their thermal properties. Several phenomenological models have been proposed to explain the anomalous heat transfer enhancement in nanoﬂuids. This paper presents a systematic literature survey to exploit the characteristics of nanoﬂuids, viz., thermal conductivity, speciﬁc heat and other thermal properties. An empirical correlation for the thermal conductivity of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ $+$ water and Cu $+$ water nanoﬂuids, considering the effects of temperature, volume fraction and size of the nanoparticle is developed and presented. A correlation for the evaluation of Nusselt number is also developed and presented and compared  in graphical form. This enhanced thermophysical and heat transfer characteristics make ﬂuids embedded with nanomaterials as excellent candidates for future applications.</p>

Our proposal has the nice features that total ionic numbers are conserved, the point-Coulomb behaviour of $\phi(r)$ is guaranteed at short-distance, and accumulation of induced charges near the centre and the surface can be demonstrated rigorously. In contrast, the standard Debye–Hückel potential $\phi_{D}(r)$ applicable to unbounded plasma has the strange features that the Gauss law cannot be obeyed at the plasma's edge, total ionic numbers themselves are altered, the short-distance Coulomb behaviour has to be imposed by hand, and induced charge appearance at the surface cannot be built-in.</p>

					<p>Small angle X-ray scattering data have been recorded for the blends of styrene butadiene, styrene copolymer/polyaniline using the beamline of the LNLS (Laboratorio Nacional de Luz sincroton-Campinas, Brazil). Employing one-dimensional Hosemann's paracrystalline model, we have simulated the meridional reﬂections of these blends in order to compute the long periodicity and hence to ﬁnd the variation with concentrations of the blends. Within the region of available experimental data we observe that there is a linear relationship between long periodicity and concentration of blends. These parameters are compared with physical measurements like tensile strength to ﬁnd the structure–property relation in these blends.</p>

					<p>The electron paramagnetic resonance parameters, zero-ﬁeld splittings (ZFSs) b$_{2}^{0}$, b$_{4}^{0}$, b$_{4}^{4}$, b$_{6}^{0}$, b$_{6}^{4}$ and the $g$ factors for Gd$^{3+}$ on the tetragonal Y$^{3+}$ site in KY$_{3}$F$_{10}$ are theoretically studied from the superposition model for the ZFSs and the approximation formula for the $g$ factor containing the admixture of the ground $^{8}$S$_{7/2}$ and the excited $^{6}$L$_{7/2}$ (L=P, D, F, G) states via the spin–orbit coupling interactions, respectively. By analysing the above ZFSs, the local structure information for the impurity Gd$^{3+}$ is obtained, i.e., the impurity–ligand bonding angles related to the four-fold (C$_{4}$) axis for the impurity Gd$^{3+}$ center are found to be about $0.6^{\circ}$ larger than those for the host Y$^{3+}$ site in KY$_{3}$F$_{10}$. The calculated ZFSs based on the above angular distortion as well as the $g$ factors are in reasonable agreement with the observed values. The present studies on the ZFSs and the local structure would be helpful to understand the optical and magnetic properties of this material with Gd dopants.</p>

				<title>Role of polyvinyl alcohol in the conductivity behaviour of polyethylene glycol-based composite gel electrolytes</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0467-0475</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An attempt has been made in the present work to combine gel and composite polymer electrolyte routes together to form a composite polymeric gel electrolyte that is expected to possess high ionic conductivity with good mechanical integrity. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) based composite gel electrolytes using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as guest polymer have been synthesized with 1 molar solution of ammonium thiocyanate (NH$_{4}$SCN) in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and electrically characterized. The ionic conductivity measurements indicate that PEG : PVA : NH$_{4}$SCN-based composite gel electrolytes are superior ($\sigma_{\text{max}} = 5.7 \times 10^{−2}$ S cm$^{−1}$) to pristine electrolytes (PEG : NH$_{4}$SCN system) and conductivity variation with ﬁller concentration remains within an order of magnitude. The observed conductivity maxima have been correlated to PEG : PVA : NH$_{4}$SCN- and PVA : NH$_{4}$SCN-type complexes. Temperature dependence of conductivity proﬁles exhibits Arrhenius behaviour in low temperature regime followed by VTF character at higher temperature.</p>

				<title>Photoacoustic spectroscopy of thin ﬁlms of As$_{2}$S$_{3}$, As$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and GeSe$_{2}$</title>
				<feature>Brief Reports</feature>
				<page>0481-0484</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) is one of the important branches of spectroscopy, which enables one to detect light-induced heat production following the absorption of pulsed radiation by the sample. As$_{2}$S$_{3}$, As$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and GeSe$_{2}$ exhibit a wide variety of photo-induced phenomena that enable them to be used as optical imaging or storage medium and various electronic devices, including electro-optic information storage devices and optical mass memories. Therefore, accurate measurement of thermal properties of semiconducting ﬁlms is necessary to study the memory density. The thermal conductivity of thin ﬁlms of As$_{2}$S$_{3}$ (thickness 100 $\mu$m and  80 $\mu$m), As$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ (thickness 100 $\mu$m and 80 $\mu$m) and GeSe$_{2}$ (thickness 120 $\mu$m and 100 $\mu$m) has been measured using PAS technique. Our result shows that the thermal conductivity of thicker ﬁlms is larger than the thinner ﬁlms. This can be explained by the thermal resistance effect between the ﬁlm and the surface of the substrate.</p>

				<title>Fifty years of Szigeti's dielectric theory – A review</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0491-0520</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the period 1949–1961 Szigeti published four seminal papers on the dielectric behaviour of crystals. Szigeti's theory is applicable to isotropic and anisotropic, ionic and covalent crystals with different structures. Szigeti's theory connects dielectric, spectroscopic and elastic properties. An important outcome of Szigeti's theory is the concept of the  effective ionic charge ($s$). It is pointed out that $s$ correlates with a number of physical properties and is a measure of ionicity of the interatomic bond. Since Szigeti's work, several theoretical models have been proposed to account for the fact that $s &#60; 1$. These models provide an insight into the complex polarization mechanisms in solids. This review summarizes Szigeti's work and the work that followed; the implications and applications of Szigeti's theory are discussed. Some new results are also included.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The charmless nonleptonic decay modes $B \rightarrow f_{0} K(\pi)$ involving a scalar and a pseudoscalar meson in the ﬁnal state are studied. The scalar meson $f_{0}$ is considered as a $q\bar{q}$ state, as favored by some recent studies. Using the generalized factorization approach, the branching ratios and CP violation parameters are computed for these modes. The form factors are calculated using the results from relativistic light front quark model and the ISGW2 model. It is found that the direct CP violation parameters in these modes are small. However, the obtained branching ratios are not in agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, these modes may be considered as possible probes for new physics.</p>

				<title>Deviation from tri-bimaximal mixings through ﬂavour twisters in inverted and normal hierarchical neutrino mass models</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0533-0549</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We explore a novel possibility for lowering the solar mixing angle ($\theta_{12}$) from tri-bimaximal mixings, without sacriﬁcing the predictions of maximal atmospheric mixing angle ($\theta_{23} = 45^{\circ}$) and zero reactor angle ($\theta_{13} = 0^{\circ}$) in the inverted and normal hierarchical neutrino mass models having 2-3 symmetry. This can be done through the identiﬁcation of a ﬂavour twister term in the texture of neutrino mass matrix and the variation of such term leads to lowering of solar mixing angle. For the observed ranges of $\Delta m_{21}^{2}$ and $\Delta m_{23}^{2}$, we calculate the predictions on tan$^{2}$ $\theta_{12} = 0.5, 0.45, 0.35$ for different input values of the parameters in the neutrino mass matrix. We also observe a possible transition from inverted hierarchical model having even CP parity (Type-IHA) to inverted hierarchical model having odd CP parity (Type-IHB) in the ﬁrst two mass eigenvalues, when there is a change in input values of parameters in the same mass matrix. The present work differs from the conventional approaches for the deviations from tri-bimaximal mixing, where the 2-3 symmetry is broken, leading to $\theta_{23} \neq 45^{\circ}$ and $\theta_{13} \neq 0^{\circ}$.</p>

				<title>Particularization of alpha contamination using CR-39 track detectors</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0567-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solid-state nuclear track detectors have found wide use in various domains of science and technology, e.g. in environmental experiments. The measurement of alpha activity on sources in an environment, such as air is not easy because of short penetration range of  alpha particles. Furthermore, measurement of alpha activity by most gas ionization detectors suffers from high background induced by the accompanying gamma radiation. Solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs) have been used successfully as detecting devices and as a passive system to detect alpha contamination on different surfaces. This work presents the response of CR-39 (for two types) to alpha particles from two sources, $^{238}$Pu with energy 5 MeV and $^{241}$Am with energy 5.4 MeV. The methods of etching and counting are investigated, along with the achievable linearity, efficiency and reproducibility. The sensitivity to low activity and energy resolution are studied.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper formulae for partial structure factors have been used to study partial structure factors of compound-forming quaternary liquid alloys by considering Hoshino's m-component hard-sphere mixture, which is based on Percus-Yevic equation of Hiroike. Formulae are applied to NaSn (Na, Sn, NaSn, Na$_{3}$Sn) which is considered as a quaternary liquid mixture with the formation of two compounds simultaneously. We have compared the total structure factors for ternary and quaternary alloys with experimental total structure factors which are found to be in good agreement. This suggests that, for suitable stoichiometric composition, two compounds are formed simultaneously. The hard-sphere diameters needed have been calculated using Troullier and Martins ab-initio pseudopotentials.</p>

				<title>Surface segregation of the metal impurity to the (100) surface of fcc metals</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The surface segregation energies for a single metal impurity to the (100) surface of nine fcc metals (Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Al and Ir) have been calculated using the MAEAM and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The results show that the effect of the surface is down to the fourth-layer and an oscillatory or monotonic damping $(|E_{1}| &#62; |E_{2}| &#62; |E_{3}| &#62; |E_{4}|)$ phenomenon in segregation energy has been obtained. The absolute value of the segregation energy $E_{1}$ for a single impurity in the ﬁrst atomic layer is much higher than that in the nether layers. Thus, whether the surface segregation will work or not is mainly determined by $E_{1}$ which is in good relation to the differences in surface energy between the impurity and host crystals $\Delta Q = Q_{\text{imp}} - Q_{\text{hos}}$. So we conclude that an impurity with lower surface energy will segregate to the surface of the host with higher surface energy.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0617-0629</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, the experimental results of the creation of the second non-dispersive Zakharenko wave ($C_{ph} = C_{g} \neq 0$) in the negative roton branch (the so-called second sound) of the bulk elementary excitations (BEEs) energy spectra are introduced. Several BEE signals detected by a bolometer situated in the isotopically pure liquid helium-II  at low temperatures $\sim 100$ mK are shown, which give evidence of negative roton creation in the liquid by helium atomic beams striking the liquid surface. The negative roton signals were clearly distinguished by the following ways: the negative roton signal created by helium atomic beams appeared earlier than the positive roton signal created by the beams, and presence of both positive and negative roton signals together. It is natural that the negative roton creation by the beams requires the $^{4}$He-atom energies $\sim 12$ K, while the positive roton creation by the atomic beams requires energies $\sim 35$ K. Therefore, successive increase in the heater power resulting in an increase in the $^{4}$He-atom energies gives solid evidence that the negative rotons are ﬁrst created in the liquid by the helium atomic beams.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We summarize recent developments in the ﬁeld of higher dimensional bosonization made by Setlur and collaborators and propose a general formula for the ﬁeld operator in terms of currents and densities in one dimension using a new ingredient known as a `singular complex number'. Using this formalism, we compute the Green function of the homogeneous electron gas in one spatial dimension with short-range interaction leading to the Luttinger liquid and also with long-range interactions that lead to a Wigner crystal whose momentum distribution computed recently exhibits essential singularities. We generalize the formalism to ﬁnite temperature by combining with the author's hydrodynamic approach. The one-particle Green function of this system with essential singularities cannot be easily computed using the traditional approach to bosonization which involves the introduction of momentum cutoffs, hence the more general approach of the present formalism is proposed as a suitable alternative.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The results of an experimental work aimed at improving the performance of the CR-39 nuclear track detector for neutron dosimetry applications are reported. A set of CR-39 plastic detectors was exposed to $^{252}$Cf neutron source, which has the emission rate of $0.68 \times 10^{8}$ s$^{−1}$, and neutron dose equivalent rate 1 m apart from the source is equal to 3.8 mrem/h. The detection of fast neutrons performed with CR-39 detector foils, subsequent chemical etching and evaluation of the etched tracks by an automatic track counting system was studied. It is found that the track density increases with the increase of neutron dose and etching time. The track density in the detector is directly proportional to the neutron fluence producing the recoil tracks, provided the track density is in the countable range. This fact plays an important role in determining the equivalent dose in the field of neutron dosimetry. These results are compared with previous work. It is found that our results are in good agreement with their investigations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper reports the DC conductivity measurements at high electric fields in vacuum evaporated amorphous thin films of a-Se$_{100−x}$Sn$_{x}$ ($x = 0, 2, 4, 6$) glassy alloys. Current–voltage ($I–V$) characteristics have been measured at various fixed temperatures. In these samples, at low electric fields, ohmic behaviour is observed. However, at high electric fields ($E \sim 10^{4}$ V/cm), non-ohmic behaviour is observed. An analysis of the experimental data confirms the presence of space charge limited conduction (SCLC) in the glassy materials studied in the present case. From the fitting of the data to the theory of SCLC, the density of defect states (DOS) near Fermi level is calculated. Increase in DOS with increase in Sn concentration has been found which could be correlated with the electronegativity difference between the two elements used here in making the glassy alloys. The peculiar role of the element Sn as an impurity in the pure Se glassy alloy is also discussed.</p>

We have also calculated the value of mobility of two-dimensional electron gas needed to predict hetero-structure device characteristics using GaAs. Best scattering parameters have been derived by close comparison between experimental and theoretical mobilities. Room temperature electron mobilities in $\Gamma$, L and X valleys are found to be nearly 9094, 945 and 247 cm$^{2}$ /V-s respectively. For the above valleys, the electron masses, deformation potentials and polar phonon temperatures have been determined to be (0.067, 0.22, 0.39m 0 ), (8.5, 9.5, 6.5 eV), and (416, 382, 542 K) as best values, respectively. The 2-DEG electron mobility in $\Gamma$ minimum increases to $1.54 \times 10^{6}$ from $1.59 \times 10^{5}$ cm$^{2}$ /V-s (for impurity concentration of $10^{14}$ cm$^{−3}$) at 10 K. Similarly, the 2-DEG electron mobility values in L and X minima are estimated to be $2.28 \times 10^{5}$ and $1.44 \times 10^{5}$ cm$^{2}$ /V-s at 10 K, which are about $\sim 4.5$ and $\sim 3.9$ times higher than normal value with impurity scattering present.</p>

				<title>Physics beyond the standard model and cosmological connections: A summary from LCWS06</title>
				<feature>Plenary</feature>
				<page>0719-0725</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The international linear collider (ILC) is likely to provide us important insights into physics sector that may supersede our current paradigm, viz., the standard model. In anticipation of the possibility that the ILC may come up in the middle of the next decade, several groups are vigourously investigating its potential to explore this new sector of physics. The Linear Collider Workshop in Bangalore (LCWS06) had several presentations of such studies which looked at supersymmetry, extra dimensions and other exotic possibilities which the ILC may help us discover or understand. Some papers also looked at the understanding of cosmology that may emerge from studies at the ILC. This paper summarises these presentations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new QCD calculation is summarized for the transverse momentum distribution of photon pairs produced by QCD subprocesses, including all-orders soft-gluon resummation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. Resummation is needed to obtain reliable predictions in the range of transverse momentum where the cross-section is the largest. Results are compared with data from the Fermilab Tevatron and predictions are made for the large hadron collider. The QCD continuum is shown to have a softer spectrum than the Higgs boson signal at the LHC.</p>

					<p>Though the predictions of the standard model (SM) are in excellent agreement with experiments, there are still several theoretical problems associated with the Higgs sector of the SM, where it is widely believed that some new physics will take over at the TeV scale.

				<abstract>
					<p>The minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) predicts the existence of new charged and neutral Higgs bosons. The pair creation of these new particles at the multi-TeV $e^{+} e^{−}$ compact linear collider (CLIC), followed by decays into standard model particles, were simulated along with the corresponding background. High-energy beam–beam effects such as ISR, beamstrahlung and hadronic background were included. We have investigated the possibility of using the ratio between the number of events found in various decay channels to determine the MSSM parameter tan $\beta$ and we have derived the corresponding statistical error from the uncertainties on the measured cross-sections and Higgs boson masses.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have performed a detailed study of the power losses in the post-collision extraction line of a TeV $e^{+}e^{−}$ collider with a crossing angle of 20 mrad at the interaction point. Five cases were considered: four luminosity configurations for ILC and one for CLIC. For all of them, the strong beam–beam effects at the interaction point lead to an emittance growth for the outgoing beam, as well as to the production of beamstrahlung photons and $e^{+}e^{−}$ coherent pairs. The power losses along the extraction line, which are due to energy deposition by a fraction of the disrupted beam, of the beamstrahlung photons and of the coherent pairs, were estimated in the case of ideal collisions, as well as with a vertical position or angular offset at the interaction point.</p>

				<feature>Higgs and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking</feature>
				<page>0771-0775</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the use of fermion polarization for studying neutral Higgs bosons at a photon collider. To this aim we construct polarization asymmetries which can isolate the contribution of a Higgs boson $\phi$ in $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow f\bar{f}$, $f = \tau/t$, from that of the QED continuum. This can help in getting information on the $\gamma \gamma \phi$ coupling in case $\phi$ is a CP eigenstate. We also construct CP-violating asymmetries which can probe CP mixing in case $\phi$ has indeterminate CP. Furthermore, we take the MSSM with CP violation as an example to demonstrate the potential of these asymmetries in a numerical analysis. We find that these asymmetries are sensitive to the presence of a Higgs boson as well as its CP properties over a wide range of MSSM parameters.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We examine, in a model independent way, the sensitivity of a linear collider to the couplings of a light Higgs boson to a pair of gauge bosons, including the possibility of CP violation. We construct several observables that probe the various possible anomalous couplings. For an intermediate mass Higgs, a collider operating at a center of mass energy of 500 GeV and with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{−1}$ is shown to be able to constrain the $ZZH$ vertex at the few per cent level, with even higher sensitivity for some of the couplings. However, lack of sufficient number of observables as well as contamination from the $ZZH$ vertex limits the precision to which anomalous part of the $W W H$ coupling can be probed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the extra dimensional scenarios with gauge fields in the bulk, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) gauge bosons can induce Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type attractive four-fermion interactions, which can break electroweak symmetry dynamically with accompanying composite Higgs fields. We consider a possibility that electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) is triggered by both a fundamental Higgs and a composite Higgs arising in a dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism induced by a new strong dynamics. The resulting Higgs sector is a partially composite two-Higgs doublet model with specific boundary conditions on the coupling and mass parameters originating at a compositeness scale $\Lambda$. The phenomenology of this model is discussed including the collider phenomenology at LHC and ILC.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Large higher-order corrections enter the Higgs boson sector of the MSSM via Higgs-boson self-energies. Their effects have to be taken into account for the correct treatment of loop-corrected Higgs-boson mass eigenstates as external (on-shell) or internal particles in Feynman diagrams. We review how the loop corrections, including momentum dependence and imaginary contributions, are correctly taken into account for external (on-shell) Higgs boson and how effective couplings can be derived. The procedures are implemented in the code FeynHiggs2.4.</p>

Not only are the detailed signatures for gravitationally induced processes altered but new contributions are found to arise due to the existence of additional scalar Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in the spectrum.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We consider the UED scenario and study the detectability of the first KK electron-positron pair at the ILC. A few hundred GeV KK electron decays into a nearly degenerate KK photon, which carries away missing energy, and the standard electron. The mass splitting between the KK electron and KK photon is controlled by the bulk- and brane-induced radiative corrections. We look for the signal event $e^{+} e^{-} +$ large missingenergy for $\sqrt{s} = 1$ TeV and observe that with a few hundred fb$^{-1}$ luminosity the signal can be deciphered from the standard model background. We briefly outline how the UED signals may be distinguished from the supersymmetric signals.</p>

					<p>Among the viable alternatives to the standard Higgs mechanism is the recently proposed Little Higgs model. The advantage here is that the model has an elementary light neutral scalar particle, which arises dynamically as against its {\textit{ad hoc}} introduction in the standard model. The model also avoids hierarchy problem. We have investigated the $W$ pair production at ILC to study the littlest Higgs model using different observables. Specifically, polarization fraction of $W$ boson is expected to be measured very accurately at ILC. We use this to put limit on the scale parameter, $f$, in the model.</p>

					<p>A vertex detector concept of the linear collider flavour identification (LCFI) collaboration, which studies pixel detectors for heavy quark flavour identification, has been implemented in simulations for $c$-quark tagging in scalar top studies. The production and decay of scalar top quarks (stops) is particularly interesting for the development of the vertex detector as only two $c$-quarks and missing energy (from undetected neutralinos) are produced for light stops. Previous studies investigated the vertex detector design in scenarios with large mass differences between stop and neutralino, corresponding to large visible energy in the detector. In this study we investigate the tagging performance dependence on the vertex detector design in a scenario with small visible energy for the international linear collider (ILC).</p>

Significantly different conclusions were obtained; signal-to-background ratio 36 vs. 2. Here assumptions and results of these two analyses are compared. We have found that differences in the final results are mainly due to different assumptions on $\gamma \gamma$-luminosity spectra, jet definitions and selection cuts.</p>

					<p>Electroweak precision measurements can provide indirect information about the possible scale of supersymmetry already at the present level of accuracy. We review present day sensitivities of precision data in mSUGRA-type models with the gravitino as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The $\chi^{2}$ fit is based on $M_{W}$, sin$^{2}$ $\theta_{\text{eff}}$, $(g - 2)_{\mu}$ BR($b \rightattow s\gamma$) and the lightest MSSM Higgs boson mass, $M_{h}$. We find indications for relatively light soft supersymmetry-breaking masses, offering good prospects for the LHC and the ILC, and in some cases also for the Tevatron.</p>

				<title>Ultimate parameters of the photon collider at the international linear collider</title>
				<feature>gg $e^{–} e^{–}$ Technology</feature>
				<page>0957-0961</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At linear colliders, the $e^{+} e^{-}$ luminosity is limited by beam-collision effects, which determine the required emittances of beams in damping rings (DRs). In $\gamma \gamma$ collisions at the photon collider, these effects are absent, and so smaller emittances are desirable. In the present damping ring designs, nominal DR parameters correspond to those required for $e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions. In this note, I would like to stress once again that as soon as we plan the photon collider mode of ILC operation, the damping ring emittances are dictated by the photon collider requirements - namely, they should be as small as possible. This can be achieved by adding more wigglers to the DRs; the incremental cost is easily justified by a considerable potential improvement of the $\gamma \gamma$ luminosity. No expert analysis exists as of now, but it seems realistic to obtain a factor five increase of the $\gamma$ luminosity compared to the `nominal' DR design.</p>

				<feature>Higgs and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking</feature>
				<page>1001-1008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Linear Collider Flavour Identification (LCFI) collaboration is continuing the work to develop column-parallel CCDs (CPCCD) and CMOS readout chips to be used in the vertex detector at the international linear collider (ILC). The CPCCD achieves several orders of magnitude faster readout than conventional CCDs because every column is equipped with amplifier and ADC, enabling efficient data taking with low occupancy. Already two generations of CPCCDs and readout chips have been manufactured and the first chips have been fully tested. The second generation devices are now being evaluated. A new CCD-based device, the in-situ storage image sensor (ISIS) has also been developed. The ISIS offers numerous advantages in terms of relaxed readout, increased radiation hardness and great immunity to EMI. In this paper we present the results from the tests of the CPCCDs, readout chips and ISIS, as well as the plans for future developments.</p>

				<title>Systematic studies of small scintillators for new sampling calorimeter</title>
				<feature>Calorimetry and Muons</feature>
				<page>1051-1056</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new sampling calorimeter using very thin scintillators and the multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) has been proposed to produce better position resolution for the international linear collider (ILC) experiment. As part of this R &#38; D study, small plastic scintillators of different sizes, thickness and wrapping reflectors are systematically studied. The scintillation light due to beta rays from a collimated $^{90}$Sr source are collected from the scintillator by wavelength-shifting (WLS) fiber and converted into electrical signals at the PMT.</p>
					<p>The wrapped scintillator that gives the best light yield is determined by comparing the measured pulse height of each $10 \times 40 \times 2$ mm strip scintillator covered with 3M reflective mirror film, teflon, white paint, black tape, gold, aluminum and white paint$+$teflon. The pulse height dependence on position, length and thickness of the 3M reflective mirror film and teflon wrapped scintillators are measured.</p>
					<p>Results show that the 3M radiant mirror film-wrapped scintillator has the greatest light yield with an average of 9.2 photoelectrons. It is observed that light yield slightly increases with scintillator length, but increases to about $100\%$ when WLS fiber diameter is increased from 1.0 mm to 1.6 mm. The position dependence measurement along the strip scintillator showed the uniformity of light transmission from the sensor to the PMT. A dip across the strip is observed which is $40\%$ of the maximum pulse height. The block type scintillator pulse height, on the other hand, is found to be almost proportional to scintillator thickness.</p>

Two wedges of brass-scintillator calorimeter are exposed to negative and positive beams with momenta between 3 and 300 GeV/c. Light produced in the scintillators are collected using wavelength shifting fibres and read out using hybrid photo-diodes. Each of the wedges has 17 layers of scintillators. In one of these wedges signal from all 17 layers are grouped together while in the other each layer is read out separately.

				<title>Evolution of the dual-readout calorimeter</title>
				<feature>Calorimetry and Muons</feature>
				<page>1075-1078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measuring the energy of hadronic jets with high precision is essential at present and future colliders, in particular at ILC. The 4th concept design is built upon calorimetry criteria that result in the DREAM prototype, read-out via two different types of longitudinal fibers, scintillator and quartz respectively, and therefore capable of determining for each shower the corresponding electromagnetic fraction, thus eliminating the strong effect of fluctuations in this fraction on the overall energy resolution. In this respect, 4th is orthogonal to the other three concepts, which rely on particle flow analysis (PFA). The DREAM test-beam results hold promises for excellent performances, coupled with relatively simple construction and moderate costs, making such a solution an interesting alternative to the PFA paradigm. The next foreseen steps are to extend the dual-readout principle to homogeneous calorimeters (with the potential of achieving even better performances) and to tackle another source of fluctuation in hadronic showers, originating from binding energy losses in nuclear break-up (measuring neutrons of few MeV energy).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A specific research and development program has been carried out by BARC in India to develop the technology for large area silicon strip detectors for application in nuclear and high energy physics experiments. These strip detectors will be used as pre-shower detector in the CMS experiment at LHC, CERN for $\pi^{0}/\lambda$ rejection. The fabrication technology to produce silicon strip detectors with very good uniformity over a large area of $\sim 40$ cm$^{2}$, low leakage currents of the order of 10 nA/cm$^{2}$ per strip and high breakdown voltage of $&#62;500$ V has been developed by BARC. The production of detectors is already under way to deliver 1000 detector modules for the CMS and $90\%$ production is completed. In this paper, research and development work carried out to develop the detector fabrication technology is briefly described. The performance of the silicon strip detectors produced in India is presented. The present status of the detector technology is discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Our group has been investigating the effects related to radiation damage of CCDs since 1998. In a series of measurements in 2003 we found the puzzling effect of very slow filling of charge traps created by radiation damage of the silicon device. In 2005 we intended to study this phenomenon in detail. However, while in 2003 we could see all the traps created by neutron irradiation in 1998-1997 unchanged, such traps unexpectedly almost completely disappeared in 2005. We explain this as an effect of annealing induced by electron irradiation, as in 2003 we irradiated with electrons the same device irradiated with neutrons in 1997-1998. Results of the 2005 measurements are presented.</p>

					<p>One of the most important requirements for a detector at the ILC is good jet energy resolution. It is widely believed that the particle flow approach to calorimetry is the key to achieving the goal of $0.3/\sqrt{E(GeV)}$. This paper describes the current performance of the PandoraPFA particle °ow algorithm. For 45 GeV jets in the Tesla TDR detector concept, the ILC jet energy resolution goal is reached. At higher energies the jet energy resolution becomes worse and can be described by the empirical expression: $\sigma_{E}/E \approx 0.265/\sqrt{E(GeV)} + 1.2 times 10^{-4} E(GeV)$.</p>

					<p>Most of the important physics processes to be studied in the international linear collider (ILC) experiment have multi-jets in the final state. In order to achieve better jet energy resolution, the so-called particle flow algorithm (PFA) will be employed and there is a general consensus that PFA derives overall ILC detector design. Four detector concepts for the ILC experiment have been proposed so far in the world; the GLD detector that has a large inner calorimeter radius, which is considered to have an advantage for a PFA, is one of them. In this paper, general scheme and performance of the GLD-PFA will be presented.</p>

As an illustration, the influence of several proposed beam parameter sets and crossing angles on the signal-to-background ratio in the stau search is estimated for a particular realization of the supersymmetric model.</p>

				<title>The stabilisation of final focus system</title>
				<feature>Machine Detector Interface</feature>
				<page>1137-1140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The StaFF (stabilisation of final focus) system will use interferometers to monitor the relative positions and orientations of several key components in the beam-delivery and interaction region. Monitoring the relative positions of the ILC final focus quadrupole magnets will be the most demanding application, where mutual and beam-relative stability will have a direct impact on machine luminosity. Established, laser-based frequency scanning interferometry (FSI) and fixed-frequency interferometry (FFI) offer positional resolution at length scales of the laser wavelength (1500 nm to 1560 nm) and a thousandth of the wavelength, respectively. As part of the ATF at KEK, StaFF will use interferometers to measure lines of a geodetic network to record relative motion between two beam position monitors. Interferometers are being designed and tested in Oxford prior to deployment at the ATF.</p>

				<title>Study of charged and neutral minimal supersymmetric standard model Higgs boson decays and measurement of tan $\beta$ at the compact linear collider</title>
				<feature>Machine Detector Interface</feature>
				<page>1141-1145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) predicts the existence of new charged and neutral Higgs bosons. The pair creation of these new particles at the multi-TeV $e^{+} e^{-}$ compact linear collider (CLIC), followed by decays into standard model particles, were simulated along with the corresponding background. High-energy beam-beam effects such as ISR, beamstrahlung and hadronic background were included. We have investigated the possibility of using the ratio between the number of events found in various decay channels to determine the MSSM parameter tan $\beta$ and we have derived the corresponding statistical error from the uncertainties on the measured cross-sections and Higgs boson masses.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The detectors of the ILC will feature a calorimeter system in the very forward region. The system comprises mainly two electromagnetic calorimeters: LumiCal, which is dedicated to the measurement of the absolute luminosity with highest precision and BeamCal, which uses the energy deposition from beamstrahlung pairs for a fast luminosity measure and the determination of beam parameters. The FCAL system is designed as a universal system fitting all detector concepts. It was implemented and simulated as a subsystem of the {\textit{large detector concept}} [1]. The studies are carried out within the FCAL collaboration.</p>

				<title>The stimulated Breit-Wheeler process as a source of background $e^{+} e^{-}$ pairs at the international linear collider</title>
				<feature>Machine Detector Interface</feature>
				<page>1159-1164</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Passage of beamstrahlung photons through the bunch fields at the interaction point of the ILC determines background pair production. The number of background pairs per bunch crossing due to the Breit-Wheeler, Bethe-Heitler and Landau-Lifshitz processes is well-known. However, the Breit-Wheeler process also takes place in and is modified by the bunch fields. A full QED calculation of this stimulated Breit-Wheeler process reveals cross-section resonances due to the virtual particle reaching the mass shell. The one-loop electron self-energy in the bunch field is also calculated and included as a radiative correction. The bunch field is considered to be a constant crossed electromagnetic field with associated bunch field photons. Resonance is found to occur whenever the energy of contributed bunch field photons is equal to the beamstrahlung photon energy. The stimulated Breit-Wheeler cross-section exceeds the ordinary Breit-Wheeler cross-section by several orders of magnitude and a significantly different pair background may result.</p>

				<title>The E166 experiment: Development of an undulator-based polarized positron source for the international linear collider</title>
				<feature>Machine Detector Interface</feature>
				<page>1165-1169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A longitudinal polarized positron beam is foreseen for the international linear collider (ILC). A proof-of-principle experiment has been performed in the final focus test beam at SLAC to demonstrate the production of polarized positrons for implementation at the ILC. The E166 experiment uses a 1 m long helical undulator in a 46.6 GeV electron beam to produce a few MeV photons with a high degree of circular polarization. These photons are then converted in a thin target to generate longitudinally polarized $e^{+}$ and $e^{-}$. The positron polarization is measured using a Compton transmission polarimeter. The data analysis has shown asymmetries in the expected vicinity of $3.4\%$ and $\sim 1\%$ for photons and positrons respectively and the expected positron longitudinal polarization is covering a range from $50\%$ to $90\%$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A polarised positron source has been proposed for the design of the international linear collider (ILC). In order to optimise the positron beam, a measurement of its degree of polarisation close to the positron creation point is desired. In this contribution, methods for determining the positron polarisation at low energies are reviewed. A newly developed polarisation extension to GEANT4 will provide the basis for further polarimeter investigations.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0003-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is shown that exp(−2 Im($\int p dr$)) is not invariant under canonical transformations in general. Specifically for shells tunneling out of black holes, this quantity is not invariant under canonical transformations. It can be interpreted as the transmission coefficient only in the cases in which it is invariant under canonical transformations. Although such cases include alpha decay, they do not include the tunneling of shells from black holes. The simplest extension to this formula which is invariant under canonical transformations is proposed. However, it is shown that this gives half the correct temperature for black holes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In a one-dimensional quantal solution of Schroedinger equation, the general expressions for reflection and transmission coefficients are derived for a potential constituting n number of rectangular wells and barriers. These expressions are readily used for the estimation of eigenvalues of a smooth potential which is simulated by a multi-step potential. The applicability of this method is demonstrated with success in potentials with different forms including the most versatile Ginocchio potential where the widely used numerical method like Runge–Kutta integration algorithm fails to yield the result. Accurate evaluation of eigenvalues free from numerical problem for any form of potentials, whether analytically solvable or not, is the highlight of the present multi-step approximation method in the theory of potential scattering.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0051-0060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The possibility to verify the pseudo-Dirac nature of neutrinos is investigated here via the detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos from distant cosmological objects like $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs). The very long baseline and the energy range from $\sim$TeV to $\sim$EeV for such neutrinos invoke the likelihood to probe very small pseudo-Dirac splittings. The expected secondary muons from such neutrinos that can be detected by a kilometer scale detector such as ICECUBE is calculated and compared with the same in the case of mass-flavour oscillations and for no oscillation cases. The calculated muon yields indicate that to probe such small pseudo-Dirac splittings one needs to look for a nearby GRB (red shift $z \sim 0:03$ or less) whereas for a distant GRB ($z \sim 1$) the flux will be much depleted and such phenomenon cannot be distinguished. Also calculated are the muon-to-shower ratios.</p>

				<title>Energy and intensity distributions of 279 keV multiply scattered photons in bronze - an inverse response matrix approach</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0061-0073</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An inverse response matrix converts the observed pulse-height distribution of a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector to a true photon spectrum. This also results in extraction of intensity and energy distributions of multiply scattered events originating from interactions of 279 keV photons with thick targets of bronze. The observed pulse-height distributions are a composite of singly and multiply scattered events in addition to bremmstrahlung originating from slowing down of Compton and photo-electrons in thick targets. To evaluate the contribution of multiply scattered events, the spectrum of singly scattered events contributing to inelastic Compton peak is reconstructed analytically. The optimum thickness (saturation depth), at which the number of multiply scattered events saturate, has been evaluated in different energy bin meshes chosen for scintillation detector response unfolding. Monte Carlo calculations based upon the package developed by Bauer and Pattison (Compton scattering experiments at the HMI (1981), HMI-B 364, pp. 1-106) supports the present experimental results.</p>

				<title>Fission decay properties of ultra neutron-rich uranium isotopes</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0087-0099</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fission decay of highly neutron-rich uranium isotopes is investigated which shows interesting new features in the barrier properties and neutron emission characteristics in the fission process. $^{233}$U and $^{235}$U are the nuclei in the actinide region in the beta stability valley which are thermally fissile and have been mainly used in reactors for power generation. The possibility of occurrence of thermally fissile members in the chain of neutron-rich uranium isotopes is examined here. The neutron number $N = 162$ or 164 has been predicted to be magic in numerous theoretical studies carried out over the years. The series of uranium isotopes around it with $N = 154-172$ are identified to be thermally fissile on the basis of the fission barrier and neutron separation energy systematics; a manifestation of the close shell nature of $N = 162$ (or 164). We consider here the thermal neutron fission of a typical representative $^{249}$U nucleus in the highly neutron-rich region. Semiempirical study of fission barrier height and width shows that $^{250}$U nucleus is stable against spontaneous fission due to increase in barrier width arising out of excess neutrons. On the basis of the calculation of the probability of fragment mass yields and the microscopic study in relativistic mean field theory, this nucleus is shown to undergo exotic decay mode of thermal neutron fission (multi-fragmentation fission) whereby a number of prompt scission neutrons are expected to be simultaneously released along with the two heavy fission fragments. Such properties will have important implications in stellar evolution involving $r$-process nucleosynthesis.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0101-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phenomenon of proton emission is treated as a process of asymmetric fission through a one-dimensional potential barrier developed due to combined effects of the Coulomb potential, centrifugal potential and various renormalization processes. The barrier is simulated to an asymmetric, smooth and analytically solvable potential with adjustable depth, shape and range. The half-lives of proton emitters in the mass range $A = 105-171$ have been calculated using exact expression for the transmission coefficients. Good agreement with the experimental data is obtained by the adjustment of just one parameter in all the cases.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents an analysis of diffraction effects taking place at different Schlieren diffracting elements. Two types of diffraction effects are prominent in the Schlieren schemes. One is diffraction of direct light (source image) at the Schlieren element, which limits the sensitivity and resolution of Schlieren systems. The second type is the diffraction of light deflected from the test object at the Schlieren-diffracting element. This second type of diffraction degrades the quality of Schlieren results. Experimental results showing the effect of diffraction of light deflected from the test object at a phase knife-edge, corner of a square phase aperture and an optical fiber tip as Schlieren diffracting elements have been presented and discussed.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0141-0152</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have exactly solved a model of equidistant cascade four-level system interacting with a single-mode radiation field both semiclassically and quantum mechanically by exploiting its similarity with Jaynes-Cummings model. For the classical field, it is shown that the Rabi oscillation of the system initially in the first level (second level) is similar to that of the system when it is initially in the fourth level (third level). We then proceed to solve the quantized version of the model where the dressed state is constructed using a six-parameter four-dimensional matrix and show that the symmetry exhibited in the Rabi oscillation of the system for the semiclassical model is completely destroyed on the quantization of the cavity field. Finally, we have studied the collapse and revival of the system for the cavity field-mode in a coherent state to discuss the restoration of symmetry and its implication is discussed.</p>

Two examples, one consisting of elliptical rods and the other comprising of rectangular rods in honeycomb lattices are considered with a view to estimate the design parameters for maximizing the complete photonic band gap. Further, it has been shown that complete photonic band gap size changes with the variation in the orientation angle of the constituent dielectric rods.</p>

					<p>Spinal ferrites having the general formula Co$_{1-x}$Zn$_{x}$Fe$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_{4}$ ($x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6$) were prepared using the wet chemical co-operation technique. The samples were annealed at $800^{\circ}$C for 12 h and were studied by means of X-ray diffraction, magnetization and low field AC susceptibility measurements. The X-ray analysis showed that all the samples had single-phase cubic spinel structure. The variation of lattice constant with Zn and Al concentration deviates from Vegard's law. The saturation magnetization $\sigma_{s}$ and magneton number $n_{B}$ measured at 300 K using high field hysteresis loop technique decreases with increasing $x$, suggesting decrease in ferrimagnetic behaviour. Curie temperature $T_{C}$ deduced from AC susceptibility data decreases with $x$, suggesting a decrease in ferrimagnetic behaviour.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of environmental temperature on neuronal spiking behaviors is investigated by numerically simulating the temperature dependence of spiking threshold of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron subject to synaptic stimulus. We find that the spiking threshold exhibits a global minimum in a specific temperature range where spike initiation needs weakest synaptic strength, which form the engineering perspective indicates the occurrence of optimal use of synaptic transmission in the nervous system. We further explore the biophysical origin of this phenomenon associated with ion channel gating kinetics and also discuss its possible biological relevance in information processing in neuronal systems.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss our very interesting experimental observation that the low-temperature two-phase coexistence in half-doped manganites is multi-valued (at any field) in that we can tune the coexisting antiferromagnetic-insulating (AF-I) and the ferromagnetic-metallic (FM-M) phase fractions by following different paths in ($H; T$) space. We have shown experimentally that the phase fraction, in this two-phase coexistence, can take continuous infinity of values. All but one of these are metastable, and two-phase coexistence is not an equilibrium state.</p>

				<title>Direct angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and superconductivity of strained high-$T_{c}$ films</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0237-0243</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Since 1997 we systematically perform direct angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on {\textit{in-situ}} grown thin ($&#60; 30$ nm) cuprate films. Specifically, we probe low-energy electronic structure and properties of high-$T_{c}$ superconductors (HTSC) under different degrees of epitaxial (compressive vs. tensile) strain. In overdoped and underdoped in-plane compressed (the strain is induced by the choice of substrate) $\simeq 15$ nm thin La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (LSCO) films we almost double $T_{c}$ to 40 K, from 20 K and 24 K, respectively. Yet the Fermi surface (FS) remains essentially two-dimensional. In contrast, ARPES data under tensile strain exhibit the dispersion that is three-dimensional, yet $T_{c}$ drastically decreases. It seems that the in-plane compressive strain tends to push the apical oxygen far away from the CuO$_{2}$ plane, enhances the two-dimensional character of the dispersion and increases $T_{c}$, while the tensile strain acts in the opposite direction and the resulting dispersion is three-dimensional. We have established the shape of the FS for both cases, and all our data are consistent with other ongoing studies, like EXAFS. As the actual lattice of cuprates is like a `Napoleon-cake', i.e. rigid CuO$_{2}$ planes alternating with softer `reservoir', that distort differently under strain, our data rule out all oversimplified two-dimensional (rigid lattice) mean field models. The work is still in progress on optimized La-doped Bi-2201 ¯lms with enhanced $T_{c}$.</p>

					<p>Electronic switching in amorphous chalcogenide semiconductors has been observed and studied for nearly forty years. Technological exploitation of this phenomenon has most recently emerged in DVD's where GST, a compound of germanium, antimony, and tellurium, is used to store information. We explain how GST behaves as a switch and how X-ray absorption fine structure can be used to unlock the specifics of the switching process. The tool that leads to this deeper understanding is the bond constraint theory. We explain how this theory leads to an explanation of switching and of the behavior and properties of amorphous materials in general. Finally, the prospects for developing GST-related materials into non-volatile memory media that could be the basis for glass computers are discussed.</p>

				<title>Defects in semiconductor nanostructures</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0255-0261</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Impurities play a pivotal role in semiconductors. One part in a million of phosphorous in silicon alters the conductivity of the latter by several orders of magnitude. Indeed, the information age is possible only because of the unique role of shallow impurities in semiconductors. Although work in semiconductor nanostructures (SN) has been in progress for the past two decades, the role of impurities in them has been only sketchily studied. We outline theoretical approaches to the electronic structure of shallow impurities in SN and discuss their limitations. We find that shallow levels undergo a SHADES (SHAllow-DEep-Shallow) transition as the SN size is decreased. This occurs because of the combined effect of quantum confinement and reduced dielectric constant in SN. Level splitting is pronounced and this can perhaps be probed by ESR and ENDOR techniques. Finally, we suggest that a perusal of literature on (semiconductor) cluster calculations carried out 30 years ago would be useful.</p>

We present results for polarization and dielectric properties as a function of temperature and epitaxial strain, leading to size-dependent temperature-strain phase diagram for the films sandwiched between `perfect' electrodes. In the presence of non-vanishing depolarization fields when non-ideal electrodes are used, we show that a stable stripe-domain phase is obtained at low temperatures. The electrostatic images in the presence of electrodes and their interaction with local dipoles in the film explain these observed phenomena.</p>

				<title>A mean field approach to Coulomb blockade for a disordered assembly of quantum dots</title>
				<feature>Contributed papers</feature>
				<page>0279-0284</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Coulomb blockade (CB) in quantum dots (QDs) is by now well documented. It has been used to guide the fabrication of single electron transistors. Even the most sophisticated techniques for synthesizing QDs (e.g. MOCVD/MBE) result in an assembly in which a certain amount of disorder is inevitable. On the other hand, theoretical approaches to CB limit themselves to an analysis of a single QD. In the present work we consider two types of disorders: (i) size disorder; e.g. QDs have a distribution of sizes which could be unimodal or bimodal in nature. (ii) Potential disorder with the confining potential assuming a variety of shapes depending on growth condition and external fields. We assume a Gaussian distribution in disorder in both size and potential and employ a simplified mean field theory. To do this we rely on the scaling laws for the CB (also termed as Hubbard $U$) obtained for an isolated QD [1]. We analyze the distribution in the Hubbard $U$ as a consequence of disorder and observe that Coulomb blockade is partially suppressed by the disorder. Further, the distribution in $U$ is a skewed Gaussian with enhanced broadening.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Charge density calculations and electronic band structures for Ga$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$Sb with $x = 1.0, 0.5$ and 0.0 are presented in this work. The calculations are performed using the empirical pseudopotential method. The charge density is computed for a number of planes, i.e. $z = 0:0, 0.125$ and $0.25 A_{0}$ by generating the potential through a number of potential parameters available in the literature. The virtual crystal approximation was applied for the semiconducting alloy. The characteristics of the band structure and charge density are observed to be affected by the potential parameters. Calculated band gaps and the nature of gaps are in good agreement with the experimental data reported. The ionicity is also reasonably in good agreement with other scales proposed in the literature; however the formulation needs to be improved. The present work also demands indirect experimental band gap for the alloy.</p>

					<p>We have investigated the pressure-induced phase transition of NiO and other structural properties using three-body potential approach. NiO undergoes phase transition from B1 (rocksalt) to B2 (CsCl) structure associated with a sudden collapse in volume showing first-order phase transition. A theoretical study of high pressure phase transition and elastic behaviour in transition metal compounds using a three-body potential caused by the electron shell deformation of the overlapping ion was carried out. The phase transition pressure and other properties predicted by our model is closer to the phase transition pressure predicted by Eto {\textit{et al}}.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Re-dispersible CdS, 5 at.$\%$ Eu$^{3+}$-doped CdS, 2 at.$\%$ Li$^{+}$ and 5 at.$\%$ Eu$^{3+}$ co-doped CdS nanoparticles in organic solvent are prepared by urea hydrolysis in ethylene glycol medium at a low temperature of $170^{\circ}$C. CdS nanoparticles have spherical shape with a diameter of $\sim 80$ nm. The asymmetric ratio ($A_{21}$) of the integrated intensities of the electrical dipole transition to the magnetic dipole transition for 5 at.$\%$ Eu$^{3+}$-doped CdS is found to be 3.8 and this ratio is significantly decreased for 2 at.$\%$ Li$^{+}$ and 5 at.$\%$ Eu$^{3+}$ co-doped CdS ($A_{21} = 2.6$). It establishes that the symmetry environment of Eu$^{3+}$ ion is more favored by Li-doping. Extra peak at 550 nm (green emission) could be seen for 2 and 5 at.$\%$ Eu$^{3+}$ co-doped CdS. Also, the significant energy transfer from host CdS to Eu$^{3+}$ is found for 5 at.$\%$ Eu$^{3+}$-doped CdS compared to that for 2 at.$\%$ Li$^{+}$ and 5 at.$\%$ Eu$^{3+}$ co-doped CdS.</p>

				<title>Compton profile study of V$_{3}$Ge and Cr$_{3}$Ge</title>
				<feature>Contributed papers</feature>
				<page>0323-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper the results of a Compton profile study of two polycrystalline A15 compounds, namely, V$_{3}$Ge and Cr$_{3}$Ge, have been reported. The measurements have been performed using 59.54 keV $\gamma$-rays from an $^{241}$Am source. The theoretical Compton profiles have been computed for both the compounds using ab-initio linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method employing CRYSTAL98. For both the A15 compounds, the isotropic experimental profiles are found to be in good overall agreement with the calculations. The comparison points out residual differences in V$_{3}$Ge whereas for Cr$_{3}$Ge the differences are within experimental error. The behaviour of valence electrons in the two iso-structural compounds has been examined on the scale of Fermi momentum. The valence electron distribution seems to be dominated by the metallic constituents rather than Ge and two compounds show covalent nature of bonding which is larger in V$_{3}$Ge compared to Cr$_{3}$Ge.</p>

				<title>Some unusual electronic patterns on graphite surface</title>
				<feature>Contributed papers</feature>
				<page>0339-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report on the observation of some unusual electronic patterns on a graphite surface using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STM). We attribute these patterns to different types of strain near the surface. One such pattern seen on a particular layer comprises of two-dimensional spatially varying super-lattice and one-dimensional fringes. This pattern is present in a finite region of a layer on the surface confined between two carbon fibers. We attribute this spatially varying super-lattice structure to the shear strain generated in the top layer due to the restraining fibers. We have also developed a model with the Moirµe rotation hypothesis that gives us a better insight into such large-scale spatially varying patterns. We have been able to model the above-observed pattern. We also report another pattern near a defect, which we attribute to the change in density of states due to the physical buckling of the top graphite layer. Part of this buckled layer is found to be buried under another layer and this region shows a reversed contrast and thus supporting our idea of buckling. We also performed tunneling spectroscopy measurements on various regions of these patterns which show significant variations in the density of states.</p>

					<p>Device quality hydrogenated amorphous silicon films (a-Si:H) are deposited at a high deposition rate (4-5 Å/s) using a mixture of argon and hydrogen-diluted silane. The films exhibit good opto-electronic properties and show less degradation upon light soaking. Light-induced changes in conductivity could be annealed at much lower temperature. The presence of Ar$^{*}$ and atomic hydrogen in plasma replaces the weak Si-Si bonds, which are responsible for light-induced degradation by strong Si-Si bonds.

				<abstract>
					<p>The room temperature experimental Mn K-edge X-ray absorption spectra of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ ($x = 0-0.7$) are compared with the band structure calculations using spin polarized density functional theory. It is explicitly shown that the observed shift in the energy of Mn K-edge on substitution of divalent Sr on trivalent La sites corresponds to the shift in the center of gravity of the unoccupied Mn $4p$-band contributing to the Mn K-absorption edge region. This correspondence is then used to separate the doping and size contributions to the edge shift due to variation in the number of electrons in valence band and Mn-O bond lengths, respectively, when Sr is doped into LaMnO$_{3}$. Such separation is helpful to find the localization behaviour of charge carriers and to understand the observed transport properties of these compounds.</p>

				<feature>Contributed papers</feature>
				<page>0367-0373</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nanoparticles of $\varepsilon$-Fe$_{2.8}$Cr$_{0.2}$N system exhibit the exchange bias phenomenon due to the exchange coupling of the spins of the antiferromagnetic (AF) oxide/oxynitride surface layer and the ferromagnetic (FM) nitride core. Exchange bias is observed at 10 K both in the absence and presence of cooling field. Due to the interface disorder, a mixture of parallel and anti-parallel/perpendicular coupling of the AF and FM spins is observed. The roughness of AF-FM interface induces disorder due to the random exchange anisotropy. The saturation magnetization is also found to be drastically lowered as compared to parent $\varepsilon$-Fe$_{3}$N. Below 58 K, the broad peak ($T_{E} \cong T_{f}$) in zero-field cooled (ZFC) magnetization curves indicates the presence of unidirectional anisotropy and spin-glass-like ordering, that arises from the freezing of localized frustrated spins.</p>

					<p>This review deals with the dynamics of quantum systems that are subject to high frequency external perturbations. Though the problem may look hopelessly time-dependent, and poised on the extreme opposite side of adiabaticity, there exists a `Kapitza Window' over which the dynamics can be treated in terms of effective time-independent Hamiltonians. The consequent results are important in the context of atomic traps as well as quantum optic properties of atoms in intense and high-frequency electromagnetic fields.</p>

					<p>A theoretical analysis of Berry's phases is given for the three-level atoms interacting with external one-mode and two-mode quantized light fields.

				<abstract>
					<p>Motivated by the Hamilton-Jacobi method of Angheben {\textit{et al}}, we investigate the Hawking tunneling radiation from a uniformly accelerating rectilinear black hole for which the horizons and entropy are functions of $\theta$. After several coordinate transformations, we conclude that when the self-gravitational interaction and energy conservation are taken into account, the actual radiation spectrum deviates from the thermal one and the tunneling rate is the function of $\theta$ though it is still related to the change of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</p>

				<title>Generalized $N$-coupled maps with invariant measure in Bose-Mesner algebra perspective</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0417-0438</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By choosing a dynamical system with $d$ different couplings, one can rearrange a system based on the graph with a given vertex dependent on the dynamical system elements. The relation between the dynamical elements (coupling) is replaced by a relation between the vertexes. Based on the $E_{0}$ transverse projection operator, we addressed synchronization problem of an array of the linearly coupled map lattices of identical discrete time systems. The synchronization rate is determined by the second largest eigenvalue of the transition probability matrix. Algebraic properties of the Bose-Mesner algebra with an associated scheme with definite spectrum has been used in order to study the stability of the coupled map lattice. Associated schemes play a key role and may lead to analytical methods in studying the stability of the dynamical systems. The relation between the coupling parameters and the chaotic region is presented. It is shown that the feasible region is analytically determined by the number of couplings (i.e. by increasing the number of coupled maps, the feasible region is restricted). It is very easy to apply our criteria to the system being studied and they encompass a wide range of coupling schemes including most of the popularly used ones in the literature.</p>

We apply the results to the first consistent calculations of the mixing of light propagating in a background magnetic field of varying directions, which show a great variety of fascinating resonant and polarization effects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A quadrupole ion trap consisting of electrode structures symmetric about $z$-axis is an important tool for conducting several precision experiments. In practice the field inside the trap does not remain purely quadrupolar, and can be calculated using numerical methods. We have used boundary element method to calculate the potential inside the truncated as well as symmetrically misaligned quadrupolar ion trap. The calculated potential values are fitted to multipole expansion and the weights of multipole moments have been evaluated by minimizing the least square deviation. The higher-order multi-pole contribution in the fabricated hyperbolic electrodes due to truncation and machining imperfections is discussed. Non-linear effects arising due to the superposition of octupole moment manifest as anharmonic oscillations of trapped ions in the non-ideal Paul trap. Theoretical simulations of non-linear effects have been carried out.</p>

					<p>Laser Raman (200-4000 cm$^{-1}$) and IR (200-4000 cm$^{-1}$) spectra of 5-aminouracil were recorded in the region 200{4000 cm$^{-1}$. Assuming a planar geometry and C$_{s}$ point group symmetry, it has been possible to assign all the 36 ($25a^{'} + 11a^{''}$) normal modes of vibration for the first time. The two NH bonds of the NH$_{2}$ group appear to be equivalent as the NH$_{2}$ stretching frequencies satisfy the empirical relation proposed for the two equivalent NH bonds of the NH$_{2}$ group. The two NH$_{2}$ stretching frequencies are distinctly separated from the CH/NH ring stretching frequencies. A strong and sharp IR band at 3360 cm$^{-1}$ could be identified as the anti-symmetric NH$^{2}$ mode whereas the band at 3290 cm$^{-1}$ with smaller density could be identified as the symmetric NH$_{2}$ stretching mode. All other bands have also been assigned different fundamentals/overtones/combinations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma breakdown is studied in a small linear cylindrical system with four different gases - hydrogen, helium, argon and nitrogen. Microwave power in the experimental system is delivered by a magnetron at $2.45 \pm 0.02$ GHz in TE$_{10}$ mode and launched radially to have extra-ordinary (X) wave in plasma. The axial magnetic field required for ECR in the system is such that the fundamental ECR surface ($B = 875.0$ G) resides at the geometrical centre of the plasma system. ECR breakdown parameters such as plasma delay time and plasma decay time from plasma density measurements are carried out at the centre using a Langmuir probe. The operating parameters such as working gas pressure ($1 \times 10^{-5} -1 \times 10^{-2}$ mbar) and input microwave power (160{800 W) are varied and the corresponding effect on the breakdown parameters is studied. The experimental results obtained are presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of electron cyclotron resonance plasma formed by lower hybrid current drive grill antenna</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0503-0516</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A 3.7 GHz system, which is meant for LHCD experiments on ADITYA tokamak, is used for producing ECR discharge. The ECR discharge is produced by setting the appropriate resonance magnetic field of 0.13 T, with hydrogen at a fill pressure of about $5 \times 10^{-5}$ Torr. The RF power, up to 10 kW (of which $\sim 50\%$ is reflected back), with a typical pulse length of 50 ms, is injected into the vacuum chamber of the ADITYA tokamak by a LHCD grill antenna and is used for plasma formation. The average coupled RF power density (the RF power/a typical volume of the plasma) is estimated to be $\sim 5$ kW/m$^{3}$. When the ECR appears inside the tokamak chamber for the given pumping frequency ($f = 3.7$ GHz) a plasma with a density ($n_{e}$) $\sim 4 \times 10^{16}$ m$^{-3}$ and electron temperature $\sim 8$ eV is produced. The density and temperature during the RF pulse are measured by sets of Langmuir probes, located toroidally, on either side of the antenna. $H_{\alpha}$ signals are also monitored to detect ionization. An estimate of density and temperature based on simple theoretical calculation agrees well with our experimental measurements. The plasma produced by the above mechanism is further used to characterize the ECR-assisted low voltage Ohmic start-up discharges. During this part of the experiments, Ohmic plasma is formed using capacitor banks. The plasma loop voltage is gradually decreased, till the discharge ceases to form. The same is repeated in the presence of ECR-formed plasma (RF pre-ionization), formed 10 ms prior to the loop voltage. We have observed that (with LHCD-induced) ECR-assisted Ohmic start-up discharges is reliably and repeatedly obtained with reduced loop voltage requirement and breakdown time decreases substantially. The current ramp-up rates also decrease with reduced loop voltage operation. These studies established that ECR plasma formed with LHCD system exhibits similar characteristics as reported earlier by dedicated ECR systems. This experiment also addresses the issue of whether ECR plasma formed with grill antenna exhibits similar behavior as that formed by single waveguide ECR antenna. Our experimental observations suggest that the characteristics of (LHCD system-induced) ECR-assisted Ohmic start-up discharges show similar properties, reported earlier with normal ECR-assisted Ohmic start-up discharges and hence LHCD system may be used as ECR system at reduced toroidal magnetic field for other applications like wall conditioning.</p>

					<p>The properties of dust-ion-acoustic (DIA) solitons in an unmagnetized dusty plasma, whose constituents are adiabatic ion-fluid, Boltzmann electrons, and static dust particles, are investigated by employing the reductive perturbation method. The Korteweg-de Vries equation is derived and its stationary solution is numerically analyzed. The parametric regimes for the existence of positive and negative solitons are found. It has been shown that ion-fluid temperature not only significantly modifies the basic features (width and amplitude) of DIA solitons, but also introduces some new features of DIA solitons.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of gadolinium doping at calcium site on the normal and super-conducting properties of Bi-2223 system were studied. The Gd-doped (BiPb)-2223 series of specimens, namely Batch I, II and III were sintered at three different sintering temperatures 830, 850 and $895^{\circ}$C respectively. The properties investigated are (1) the normal state resistivity with a view to study metal-to-insulator transition, (2) the XRD patterns of the specimens with a view to study the relative composition of (BiPb)-2212 and (BiPb)-2223 phases and (3) the superconducting fluctuation behaviour (SFB) with a view to determine the effect of doping, if any, on the dimensionality of the fluctuation conductivity of the system. The normal state resistivity of Gd-substituted Bi-2223 specimens shows metallic, semiconducting and insulating behaviour. The $T_{c}(R = 0)$ values indicate that (BiPb)-2223 phase is responsible for the observed superconducting transitions in Batch I and Batch II specimens with Gd concentrations $x \leq 0.7$. This observation is further confirmed in the analysis of XRD patterns of these specimens. Gadolinium, being a magnetic impurity, has pair breaking effect near the Fermi level and decreases $T_{c}(R = 0)$. The analysis of the superconducting fluctuation behaviour (SFB) shows a 2D dimensionality without any cross-over.</p>

				<title>Dielectric relaxation of binary polar liquid mixture measured in benzene at 10 GHz frequency</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0543-0552</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dielectric relaxation times $\tau_{jk}$'s and dipole moments $\mu_{jk}$'s of the binary ($j_{k}$) polar liquid mixture of N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMA) and acetone (Ac) dissolved in benzene (i) are estimated from the measured real $\sigma_{ijk}^{'}$ and imaginary $\sigma_{ijk}^{''}$ parts of  complex high frequency conductivity $\sigma_{ijk}^{*}$ of the solution for different weight fractions $w_{jk}$'s of 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 mole fractions $x_{j}$ of Ac and temperatures (25, 30, 35 and 40$^{\circ}$C) respectively under 9.88 GHz electric field. $\tau_{jk}$'s are obtained from the ratio of slopes of $\sigma_{ijk}^{''} - w_{jk}$ and $\sigma_{ijk}^{'} - w_{jk}$ curves at $w_{jk} \rightarrow 0$ as well as linear slope of $\sigma_{ijk}^{''} - \sigma_{ijk}^{'}$ curves of the existing method (Murthy {\textit{et al}}, 1989) in order to eliminate polar-polar interaction in the latter case. The calculated $\tau$'s are in excellent agreement with the reported $\tau$'s due to Gopalakrishna's method. $\mu_{jk}$'s are also estimated from slopes $\beta$'s of total conductivity $\sigma_{ijk} - w_{jk}$ curves at $w_{jk} \rightarrow 0$ and the values agree well with the reported $\mu$'s from G.K. method. The variation of $\tau_{jk}$'s and $\mu_{jk}$'s with $x_{j}$ of Ac reveals that solute-solute molecular association occurs within $0.0-0.3x_{j}$ of Ac beyond which solute-solvent molecular association is predicted. The theoretical dipole moments $\mu_{\text{theo}}$'s are calculated from bond angles and bond moments to have exact $\mu$'s only to show the presence of inductive, mesomeric and electromeric effects in the substituent polar groups. The thermodynamic energy parameters are estimated from ln($\tau_{jk}T$) against $1/T$ linear curve from Eyring's rate theory to know the molecular dynamics of the system and to establish the fact that the mixture obeys the Debye-Smyth relaxation mechanism.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0553-0563</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an emerging technique for simultaneous multi-elemental analysis of solids, liquids and gases with minute or no sample preparation and thus revolutionized the area of on-line analysis technologies. The foundation for LIBS is a solid state, short-pulsed laser that is focused on a sample to generate a high-temperature plasma, and the emitted radiation from the excited atomic and ionic fragments produced within the plasma is characteristic of the elemental composition of the sample that can be detected and analyzed using a suitable optical spectrograph. In the present paper, the applicability of LIBS for different solid samples having homogeneous (silver ornament, aluminum plate) or heterogeneous composition (soil) using nanosecond laser pulses is discussed. Nanosecond pulse laser makes plasma at the sample surface even at very low pulse energies and also allows for precise ablation of the substrate material with little damage to the surrounding area. We have also studied the penetration of different heavy metals inside the soil surface.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Bianchi Type-I cosmological models containing perfect fluid with time varying $G$ and $\Lambda$ have been presented. The solutions obtained represent an expansion scalar $\theta$ bearing a constant ratio to the anisotropy in the direction of space-like unit vector $\lambda^{i}$. Of the two models obtained, one has negative vacuum energy density, which decays numerically. In this model, we obtain $\Lambda \sim H^{2}$, $\Lambda \sim R_{44}/R$ and $\Lambda \sim T^{-2}$ ($T$ is the cosmic time) which is in accordance with the main dynamical laws for the decay of $\Lambda$. The second model reduces to a static solution with repulsive gravity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using K-causal relation introduced by Sorkin and Woolgar [1], we generalize results of Garcia-Parrado and Senovilla [2,3] on causal maps. We also introduce causality conditions with respect to K-causality which are analogous to those in classical causality theory and prove their inter-relationships. We introduce a new causality condition following the work of Bombelli and Noldus [4] and show that this condition lies in between global hyperbolicity and causal simplicity. This approach is simpler and more general as compared to traditional causal approach [5,6] and it has been used by Penrose {\textit{et al}} [7] in giving a new proof of positivity of mass theorem. $C^{0}$-space-time structures arise in many mathematical and physical situations like conical singularities, discontinuous matter distributions, phenomena of topology-change in quantum field theory etc.</p>

				<title>Effects of charged Higgs bosons in the deep inelastic process $\nu_{\tau} N \rightarrow \tau^{-} X$ and the possibility of detecting tau-neutrinos at cosmic neutrino detectors</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0603-0615</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study the deep inelastic process $\nu_{\tau} + N \rightarrow \tau^{-} + X$ (with $N \equiv (n + p)/2$ an isoscalar nucleon), in the context of the two-Higgs doublet model Type II (2HDM(II)). We discuss the contribution to the total cross-section of diagrams, in which a charged Higgs boson is exchanged. We present results which show strong dependence of such contributions on tan $\beta$ and $M_{H^{\pm}}$. We show that for tan $\beta \simeq 150$ and $M_{H^{\pm}} \simeq 300$ GeV, the contribution of the charged Higgs boson exchange diagrams to the cross-section of the charged current inclusive $\nu_{\tau}N$ collision can become important. We find that this contribution for an inclusive dispersion generated through the collision of an ultra-high-energy tau-neutrino with $E_{\nu} \simeq 1021$ eV on a target nucleon can be as large as $40\%$ of the value of the contribution of the $W^{\pm}$ exchange diagrams, provided $M_{H^{\pm}} \simeq 300$ GeV and tan $\beta \simeq 150$. Such enhancement and the induced variation on the mean inelasticity $\langle y \rangle^{CC}$ could lead to sizeable effects in the acceptance of cosmic tau-neutrino detectors at experiments such as HiRes, PAO, and the CRTNT, which are anchored to the ground, and at experiments such as EUSO and OWL, which are proposed to orbit around the Earth. We also compare the contribution to $\sigma_{H^{+}}^{\text{tot}}$ from the different allowed initial quarks and we show that the contribution from the bottom quark dominates by far. This means that the $H^{\pm}$ contribution practically always gives a top quark in the final state. Such a large component of the cross-section having a top quark event in the final state could have recognizable features in the EAS experiments.</p>

				<title>Cold valleys in the radioactive decay of $^{248-254}$Cf isotopes</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0617-0632</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Based on the concept of cold valley in cold fission and fusion, we have investigated the cluster decay process in $^{248-254}$Cf isotopes. In addition to alpha particle minima, other deep minima occur for S, Ar and Ca clusters. It is found that inclusion of proximity potential does not change the position of minima but minima become deeper. Taking Coulomb and proximity potential as interacting barrier for post-scission region, we computed half-lives and other characteristics for various clusters from these parents. Our study reveals that these parents are stable against light clusters and unstable against heavy clusters. Computed half-lives for alpha decay agree with experimental values within two orders of magnitude. The most probable clusters from these parents are predicted to be $^{46}$Ar, $^{48,50}$Ca which indicate the role of doubly or near doubly magic clusters in cluster radioactivity. Odd A clusters are found to be favorable for emission from odd A parents. Cluster decay model is extended to symmetric region and it is found that symmetric fission is also probable which stresses the role of doubly or near doubly magic $^{132}$Sn nuclei. Geiger-Nuttal plots were studied for various clusters and are found to be linear with varying slopes and intercepts.</p>

					<p>A quadratic model is suggested to describe the fringe shift occurred due to the phase variations of uncladded glass fiber introduced between the two plates of the liquid wedge interferometer. The fringe shift of the phase object is represented in the harmonic term which appears in the denominator of the Airy distribution formula of Fabry-Perot's interferometer. A computer program is written to plot the computed fringe shifts of the described model.</p>
					<p>An experiment is conducted using liquid wedge interferometer where the fiber of a nearly quadratic thickness variation is introduced between the two plates of the interferometer. The obtained fringe shift shows a good agreement with the proposed quadratic model. Also, it is compared with the previous theoretical shift based on ray optics of semi-circular shape.</p>

We consider the pump energy to be deposited into the pump region which has been slightly displaced with respect to the crystal center. An analytical expression for temperature distribution for such off-central diode-pumped laser is investigated. The results are then applied to the Nd :YAG and Nd :YVO4 laser crystals and compared with the conventional diode-pumped lasers. We showed that in this special case, the temperature distribution equation in the off-central pumping convert to the conventional central pump scheme.</p>

					<p>We work with a formulation of Noether-symmetry analysis which uses the properties of infinitesimal point transformations in the space-time variables to establish the association between symmetries and conservation laws of a dynamical system. Here symmetries are expressed in the form of generators. We have studied the variational or Noether symmetries of the damped harmonic oscillator representing it by an explicitly time-dependent Lagrangian and found that a five-parameter group of transformations leaves the action integral invariant. Amongst the associated conserved quantities only two are found to be functionally independent. These two conserved quantities determine the solution of the problem and correspond to a two-parameter Abelian subgroup.</p>

					<p>We develop two measures to characterize the geometry of patterns exhibited by the state of spiral defect chaos, a weakly turbulent regime of Rayleigh-Bénard convection. These describe the packing of contiguous stripes within the pattern by quantifying their length and nearest-neighbor distributions. The distributions evolve towards  unique distribution with increasing Rayleigh number that suggests power-law scaling for the dynamics in the limit of infinite system size. The techniques are generally applicable to patterns that are reducible to a binary representation.</p>

					<p>The local, average and electronic structure of the semiconducting materials Si and Ge has been studied using multipole, maximum entropy method (MEM) and pair distribution function (PDF) analyses, using X-ray powder data. The covalent nature of bonding and the interaction between the atoms are clearly revealed by the two-dimensional MEM maps plotted on (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) planes and one-dimensional density along [1 0 0], [1 1 0] and [1 1 1] directions. The mid-bond electron densities between the atoms are 0.554 e/Å$^{3}$ and 0.187 e/Å$^{3}$ for Si and Ge respectively. In this work, the local structural information has also been obtained by analyzing the atomic pair distribution function. An attempt has been made in the present work to utilize the X-ray powder data sets to refine the structure and electron density distribution using the currently available versatile methods, MEM, multipole analysis and determination of pair distribution function for these two systems.</p>

				<title>Superconducting gap anomaly in heavy fermion systems</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0711-0730</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The heavy fermion system (HFS) is described by the periodic Anderson model (PAM), treating the Coulomb correlation between the $f$-electrons in the mean-field Hartree-Fock approximation. Superconductivity is introduced by a BCS-type pairing term among the conduction electrons. Within this approximation the equation for the superconducting gap is derived, which depends on the effective position of the energy level of the $f$-electrons relative to the Fermi level. The latter in turn depends on the occupation probability $n^{f}$ of the $f$-electrons. The gap equation is solved self-consistently with the equation for $n^{f}$; and their temperature dependences are studied for different positions of the bare $f$-electron energy level, with respect to the Fermi level. The dependence of the superconducting gap on the hybridization leads to a re-entrant behaviour with increasing strength. The induced pairing between the $f$-electrons and the pairing of mixed conduction and $f$-electrons due to hybridization are also determined. The temperature dependence of the hybridization parameter, which characterizes the number of electrons with mixed character and represents the number of heavy electrons is studied. This number is shown to be small. The quasi-particle density of states (DOS) shows the existence of a pseudo-gap due to superconductivity and the signature of a hybridization gap at the Fermi level. For the choice of the model parameters, the DOS shows that the HFS is a metal and undergoes a transition to the gap-less superconducting state.</p>

The experimental isothermal compressibility has been evaluated from measured values of speeds of sound and density. The isothermal compressibility of these mixtures has also been computed theoretically using different models for hard sphere equations of state and Flory's statistical theory. Computed values of isothermal compressibility have been compared with experimental findings. A satisfactory agreement has been observed. The superiority of Flory's statistical theory has been established quite reasonably over hard sphere models.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The equations obtained by Yang while discussing the condition of self-duality of $SU(2)$ gauge fields on Euclidean four-dimensional space have been generalized. Exact solutions and their graphical representations for the generalized equation (for some particular values of the parameters) have been reported. They represent interesting physical characteristics like waves with spreading solitary profile, spreading wave packets, waves with pulsating solitary profile (between zero and a maximum), waves with oscillatory solitary profile and chaos.</p>

				<title>Parametric optimum analysis of an irreversible Ericsson cryogenic refrigeration cycle working with an ideal Fermi gas</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0779-0795</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An irreversible model of an Ericsson cryogenic refrigeration cycle working with an ideal Fermi gas is established, which is composed of two isothermal and two isobaric processes. The influence of both the quantum degeneracy and the finite-rate heat transfer between the working fluid and the heat reservoirs on the performance of the cycle is investigated, based on the theory of statistical mechanics and thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas. The inherent regeneration losses of the cycle are analyzed. Expressions for several important performance parameters such as the coefficient of performance, cooling rate and power input are derived. By using numerical solutions, the cooling rate of the cycle is optimized for a given power input. The maximum cooling rate and the corresponding parameters are calculated numerically. The optimal regions of the coefficient of performance and power input are determined. Especially, the optimal performance of the cycle in the strong and weak gas degeneracy cases and the high temperature limit is discussed in detail. The analytic expressions of some optimized parameters are derived. Some optimum criteria are given. The distinctions and connections between the Ericsson refrigeration cycles working with the Fermi and classical gases are revealed.</p>

				<page>0797-0804</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heavy flavor baryons containing single and double charm (beauty) quarks with light flavor combinations are studied using the hypercentral description of the three-body problem. The confinement potential is assumed as hypercentral Coulomb plus power potential with power index $\nu$. The ground state masses of the heavy flavor, $J^{P} = \dfrac{1}{2}^{+}$ and $\dfrac{3}{2}^{+}$ baryons are computed for different power indices, $\nu$ starting from 0.5 to 2.0. The predicted masses are found to attain a saturated value in each case of quark combinations beyond the power index $\nu = 1.0$.</p>

					<p>In this work, we analyse the positive parity of states of odd-mass nucleus within the framework of interacting boson-fermion model. The result of an IBFM-1 multilevel calculation with the 2d$_{5/2}$, 1g$_{7/2}$, 3s$_{1/2}$, 2d$_{3/2}$ and 1h$_{11/2}$, single particle orbits is reported for the positive parity states of the odd-mass nucleus $^{125-129}$Xe. Also, an IBM- 1 calculation is presented for the low-lying states in the even-even $^{124-128}$Xe core nucleus. The energy levels and $B(E2)$ transition probabilities were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was found that the calculated positive parity low-spin state energy spectra of the odd-mass $^{125-129}$Xe isotopes agree quite well with the experimental data.</p>

				<title>A perturbed angular correlation spectrometer for material science studies</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0835-0846</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A four-detector perturbed angular correlation (PAC) spectrometer has been developed with ultra-fast BaF$_{2}$ detectors to acquire four coincidence spectra simultaneously, two at $180^{\circ}$ and two at $90^{\circ}$. This spectrometer has double efficiency compared to that of a three-detector set-up. Higher efficiency is desirable for PAC studies in solid state physics where large number of coincidences are required to obtain the PAC spectra with good statistics and is particularly useful when the half-lives of the parent probe nuclei used for PAC measurements are $\sim 2-3$ days or less as in $^{111}$In (2.8 d), $^{99}$Mo (2.7 d) and $^{140}$La (1.7 d). The performance of the spectrometer has been tested for the HfO$_{2}$ monoclinic crystal in the temperature range from 77 to 873 K and for the HfF$_{4}$.3H$_{2}$O crystal at room temperature. The polycrystalline HfO$_{2}$ has been synthesized from Hf metal by heating in air. The hydrated hafnium fluoride has been crystallized by dissolving Hf metal in $40\%$ HF and drying slowly at room temperature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The resonance states in $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O, $^{12}$C + $^{16}$O, $\alpha$ + $^{16}$O and $\alpha$ + $^{12}$C are described using modified Morse potential proposed earlier whose success has already been demon-strated in the case of $^{12}$C + $^{12}$C system. The general validity of such a potential with long range, shallow depth and repulsive soft core determined from the resonance data itself is being examined through the present study of the resonances in the above four systems. In each system, the experimental data of a large number of states have been successfully described with a modified Morse potential. The success points out a common mechanism of the origin of these states, and reaffirms authentically the diatomic-like rotational and vibrational picture of the nuclear molecular resonances proposed previously. The close resemblance between the physics of diatomic molecules and nuclear molecular resonances extending to the level of potential which is Morse type in both the cases - although belong to two different areas of physics - is further strengthened through the present study.</p>

				<title>Dependence of NaI(Tl) detector intrinsic effciency on source-detector distance, energy and off-axis distance: Their implications for radioactivity measurements</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0863-0874</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work the dependence of intrinsic effciency of a NaI(Tl) detector of radius 3.82 cm and height 7.62 cm on source{detector distance $(d)$, source-off-axis distance $(d_{0})$ and $\gamma$-photon energy have been investigated using analytical and Monte Carlo methods. The results showed that, for a given off-axis distance, there exists a value of the ratio of source-detector distance $(d)$ to detector radius $(R)$ where intrinsic efficiency is minimum. This $d/R$ value at which minimum e±ciency occurs approaches zero as off-axis distance increases and it is almost constant with increase in energy. In the region where $d/R &#60; 0:01$, a criteria given by Jehouani {\textit{et al}} [1] for good photon detection, intrinsic efficiency decreases with increasing off-axis distance. The implications of the results for radioactivity measurement and radiation protection are discussed. Chacteristics of intrinsic e±ciency in the regions $d/R &#60; 0:01$ and $d/R &#62; 10$ are also compared.</p>

				<title>Scattering of light by a periodic structure in the presence of randomness VII: Application of statistical detection test</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0875-0886</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Detection of periodic structures, hidden in random surfaces has been addressed by us for some time and the `extended matched filter' method, developed by us, has been shown to be effective in detecting the hidden periodic part from the light scattering data in circumstances where conventional data analysis methods cannot reveal the successive peaks due to scattering by the periodic part of the surface. It has been shown that if $r_{0}$ is the coherence length of light on scattering from the rough part and $\Lambda$ is the wavelength of the periodic part of the surface, the extended matched filter method can detect hidden periodic structures for $(r_{0}/\Lambda) \geq 0:11$, while conventional methods are limited to much higher values ($(r_{0}/\Lambda) \geq 0:33)$. In the method developed till now, the detection of periodic structures involves the detection of the central peak, first peak and second peak in the scattered intensity of light, located at scattering wave vectors $v_{x} = 0, Q, 2Q$, respectively, where $Q = 2\pi/\Lambda$, their distinct identities being obfuscated by the fact that the peaks have width $\Delta v_{x} = 2\pi/r_{0} \gg Q$. The relative magnitudes of these peaks and the consequent problems associated in identifying them is discussed. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical goodness test is used to justify the identification of the peaks. This test is used to `reject' or `not reject' the null hypothesis which states that the successive peaks do exist. This test is repeated for various values of $r_{0}/\Lambda$, which leads to the conclusion that there is really a periodic structure hidden behind the random surface.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple procedure to solve two fully quantized non-linear Jaynes-Cummings models is presented, one in which an atom interacts with a two-mode radiation field in a Raman-type process and the other involving multiphoton interaction between the two-mode field and the atom. Effect of intensity-dependent coupling between the field and the atom in both the above-mentioned cases has also been investigated. The unitary transformation method presented here not only solves the time-dependent problem but also permits a determination of the eigensolutions of the interacting Hamiltonian at the same time. Graphical features of the time dependence of the population inversion have been analysed when one of the field modes is prepared initially in a coherent state while the other one in a vacuum state.</p>

				<title>Variability of permeability with diameter of conduit</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0901-0909</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An entry length is always observed before laminar flow is achieved in fluid flowing in a conduit. This depends on the Reynolds number of the flow and the degree of smoothness of the conduit. This work examined this region and the point where laminar flow commences in the context of flow through conduit packed with porous material like beads, of known porosity. Using some theoretical assumptions, it is demonstrated that permeability varies from zero at wall-fluid boundary to maximum at mid-stream, creating a permeability profile similar to the velocity profile. An equation was obtained to establish this. We also found that peak values of permeability increase with increasing porosity, and therefore entry length increases with increasing porosity with all other parameters kept constant. A plot of peak permeability versus porosity revealed that they are linearly related.</p>

				<title>Analytical solutions for some defect problems in 1D hexagonal and 2D octagonal quasicrystals</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0911-0933</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study some typical defect problems in one-dimensional (1D) hexagonal and two-dimensional (2D) octagonal quasicrystals. The first part of this investigation addresses in detail a uniformly moving screw dislocation in a 1D hexagonal piezoelectric quasicrystal with point group $6mm$. A general solution is derived in terms of two functions $\varphi_{1}$, $\varphi_{2}$, which satisfy wave equations, and another harmonic function $\varphi_{3}$. Elementary expressions for the phonon and phason displacements, strains, stresses, electric potential, electric fields and electric displacements induced by the moving screw dislocation are then arrived at by employing the obtained general solution. The derived solution is verified by comparison with existing solutions. Also obtained in this part of the investigation is the total energy of the moving screw dislocation. The second part of this investigation is devoted to the study of the interaction of a straight dislocation with a semi-infinite crack in an octagonal quasicrystal. Here the crack penetrates through the solid along the period direction and the dislocation line is parallel to the period direction. We first derive  a general solution in terms of four analytic functions for plane strain problem in octagonal quasicrystals by means of differential operator theory and the complex variable method. All the phonon and phason displacements and stresses can be expressed in terms of the four analytic functions. Then we derive the exact solution for a straight dislocation near a semi-infinite crack in an octagonal quasicrystal, and also present the phonon and phason stress intensity factors induced by the straight dislocation and remote loads.</p>

Living microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast were used. Untreated PS films show very fast rate of growth of bacteria within few hours. The study involves developments of polymer surfaces with bacterial growth and further studies after giving antibacterial treatment such as plasma treatment. Major emphasis has been given to study the effect of various parameters which can affect the performance of the improved material. Films were prepared by two methods: plasma treatment under vacuum and under ongoing He-Ne laser source. The parameters such as (1) surface area by contact angle measurements, (2) quality of material before and after treatment by SEM and FTIR spectra and (3) material characterization by UV-vis spectra were studied.

				<title>Understanding the sub-critical transition to turbulence in wall flows</title>
				<feature>Reviews and Methods</feature>
				<page>1009-1021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In contrast with free shear flows presenting velocity profiles with injection points which cascade to turbulence in a relatively mild way, wall bounded flows are deprived of (inertial) instability modes at low Reynolds numbers and become turbulent in a much wilder way, most often marked by the coexistence of laminar and turbulent domains at intermediate Reynolds numbers, well below the range where (viscous) instabilities can show up. There can even be no unstable mode at all, as for plane Couette flow (pCf) or for Poiseuille pipe flow (Ppf) that are currently the subject of intense research. Though the mechanisms involved in the transition to turbulence in wall flows are now better understood, statistical properties of the transition itself are yet unsatisfactorily assessed. A widely accepted interpretation rests on non-trivial solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the form of unstable travelling waves and on transient chaotic states associated to chaotic repellors. Whether these concepts typical of the theory of temporal chaos are really appropriate is yet unclear owing to the fact that, strictly speaking, they apply when confinement in physical space is effective while the physical systems considered are rather extended in at least one space direction, so that spatiotemporal behaviour cannot be ruled out in the transitional regime. The case of pCf will be examined in this perspective through numerical simulations of a model with reduced cross-stream $(y)$ dependence, focusing on the in-plane $(x, z)$ space dependence of a few velocity amplitudes. In the large aspect-ratio limit, the transition to turbulence takes place via spatiotemporal intermittency and we shall attempt to make a connection with the theory of first-order (thermodynamic) phase transitions, as suggested long ago by Pomeau.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The dynamics of inertial particles in 2-d incompressible flows can be modeled by 4-d bailout embedding maps. The density of the inertial particles, relative to the density of the fluid, is a crucial parameter which controls the dynamical behaviour of the particles. We study here the dynamical behaviour of aerosols, i.e. particles heavier than the flow. An attractor widening and merging crisis is seen in the phase space in the aerosol case. Crisis-induced intermittency is seen in the time series and the laminar length distribution of times before bursts give rise to a power law with the exponent $\beta = -1/3$. The maximum Lyapunov exponent near the crisis fluctuates around zero indicating unstable dimension variability (UDV) in the system. The presence of unstable dimension variability is confirmed by the behaviour of the probability distributions of the finite time Lyapunov exponents.</p>

				<title>Assessing the quality of stochastic oscillations</title>
				<feature>Reviews and Methods</feature>
				<page>1047-1053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyze the relationship between the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of two-state systems, in particular the regime in which the microscopic one shows sustained `stochastic oscillations' while the macroscopic tends to a fixed point. We propose a quantification of the oscillatory appearance of the fluctuating populations, and show that good stochastic oscillations are present if a parameter of the macroscopic model is small, and that no microscopic model will show oscillations if that parameter is large. The transition between these two regimes is smooth. In other words, given a macroscopic deterministic model, one can know whether any microscopic stochastic model that has it as a limit, will display good sustained stochastic oscillations.</p>

				<feature>Reviews and Methods</feature>
				<page>1055-1061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phase diagram of the coupled sine circle map system exhibits a variety of interesting phenomena including spreading regions with spatiotemporal intermittency, non-spreading regions with spatial intermittency, and coherent structures termed solitons. A spreading to non-spreading transition is seen in the system. A cellular automaton version of the coupled system maps the spreading to non-spreading transition to a transition from a probabilistic to a deterministic cellular automaton. The solitonic sector of the system shows spatiotemporal intermittency with soliton creation, propagation and absorption. A probabilistic cellular automaton mapping is set up for this sector which can identify each one of these phenomena.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study the relationship between synchronization and the rate with which information is exchanged between nodes in a spatio-temporal network that describes the dynamics of classical particles under a substrate Remoissenet-Peyrard potential. We also show how phase and complete synchronization can be detected in this network. The difficulty in detecting phase synchronization in such a network appears due to the highly non-coherent character of the particle dynamics which unables a proper definition of the phase dynamics. The di±culty in detecting complete synchronization appears due to the spatio character of the potential which results in an asymptotic state highly dependent on the initial state.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Recent research has revealed a rich and complicated network topology in the cortical connectivity of mammalian brains. A challenging task is to understand the implications of such network structures on the functional organisation of the brain activities. We investigate synchronisation dynamics on the corticocortical network of the cat by modelling each node of the network (cortical area) with a subnetwork of interacting excitable neurons. We find that this network of networks displays clustered synchronisation behaviour and the dynamical clusters closely coincide with the topological community structures observed in the anatomical network. The correlation between the firing rate of the areas and the areal intensity is additionally examined. Our results provide insights into the relationship between the global organisation and the functional specialisation of the brain cortex.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the dynamic processes on networks collective effects emerge due to the couplings between nodes, where the network structure may play an important role. Interaction along many network links in the nonlinear dynamics may lead to a kind of chaotic collective behavior. Here we study two types of well-de¯ned diffusive dynamics on scale-free trees: traffic of packets as navigated random walks, and chaotic standard maps coupled along the network links. We show that in both cases robust collective dynamic effects appear, which can be measured statistically and related to non-ergodicity of the dynamics on the network. Specifically, we find universal features in the fluctuations of time series and appropriately defined return-time statistics.</p>

				<page>1109-1116</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study message transfer in a 2-d communication network of regular nodes and randomly distributed hubs. We study both single message transfer and multiple message transfer on the lattice. The average travel time for single messages travelling between source and target pairs of fixed separations shows $q$-exponential behaviour as a function of hub density with a characteristic power-law tail, indicating a rapid drop in the average travel time as a function of hub density. This power-law tail arises as a consequence of the log-normal distribution of travel times seen at high hub densities. When many messages travel on the lattice, a congestion-decongestion transition can be seen. The waiting times of messages in the congested phase show a Gaussian distribution, whereas the decongested phase shows a log-normal distribution. Thus the waiting time distributions carry the signature of congested or decongested behaviour.</p>

				<title>Dynamics of delayed-coupled chaotic logistic maps: Influence of network topology, connectivity and delay times</title>
				<feature>Applications</feature>
				<page>1117-1125</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We review our recent work on the synchronization of a network of delay-coupled maps, focusing on the interplay of the network topology and the delay times that take into account the finite velocity of propagation of interactions. We assume that the elements of the network are identical ($N$ logistic maps in the regime where the individual maps, without coupling, evolve in a chaotic orbit) and that the coupling strengths are uniform throughout the network. We show that if the delay times are su±ciently heterogeneous, for adequate coupling strength the network synchronizes in a spatially homogeneous steady state, which is unstable for the individual maps without coupling. This synchronization behavior is referred to as `suppression of chaos by random delays' and is in contrast with the synchronization when all the interaction delay times are homogeneous, because with homogeneous delays the network synchronizes in a state where the elements display in-phase time-periodic or chaotic oscillations. We analyze the influence of the network topology considering four different types of networks: two regular (a ring-type and a ring-type with a central node) and two random (free-scale Barabasi-Albert and small-world Newman-Watts). We find that when the delay times are sufficiently heterogeneous the synchronization behavior is largely independent of the network topology but depends on the network's connectivity, i.e., on the average number of neighbors per node.</p>

					<p>We study a network of chaotic model neurons incorporating threshold activated coupling. We obtain a wide range of spatiotemporal patterns under varying degrees of asynchronicity in the evolution of the neuronal components. For instance, we find that sequential updating of threshold-coupled chaotic neurons can yield dynamical switching of the individual neurons between two states. So varying the asynchronicity in the updating scheme can serve as a control mechanism to extract different responses, and this can have possible applications in computation and information processing.</p>

				<page>1153-1164</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Here we introduce a model of parametrically coupled chaotic maps on a one-dimensional lattice. In this model, each element has its internal self-regulatory dynamics, whereby at fixed intervals of time the nonlinearity parameter at each site is adjusted by feedback from its past evolution. Additionally, the maps are coupled sequentially and unidirectionally, to their nearest neighbor, through the difference of their parametric variations. Interestingly we find that this model asymptotically yields clusters of superstable oscillators with different periods. We observe that the sizes of these oscillator clusters have a power-law distribution. Moreover, we find that the transient dynamics gives rise to a $1/f$ power spectrum. All these characteristics indicate self-organization and emergent scaling behavior in this system. We also interpret the power-law characteristics of the proposed system from an ecological point of view.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper aims to introduce a new symmetry principle in the space-time geometry through the elimination of the classical idea of rest and by including a universal minimum speed limit in the subatomic world. Such a limit, unattainable by particles, represents the preferred reference frame associated with a universal background field that breaks Lorentz symmetry. Thus, the structure of space-time is extended due to the presence of a vacuum energy density, which leads to a negative pressure at cosmological scales. The tiny values of the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density shall be successfully obtained, which are in good agreement with current observational results.</p>

					<p>Structures of H$_{2}$CN and CH$_{2}$CN molecules are similar to that of H$_{2}$CO molecule. The H$_{2}$CO has shown anomalous absorption for its transition $1_{11} - 1_{10}$ at 4.8 GHz in a number of cool molecular clouds. Though the molecules H$_{2}$CN and CH$_{2}$CN have been identified in TMC-1 and Sgr B2 through some transitions in ortho as well as in para species, here we have investigated the condition under which transitions $1_{11} - 1_{10}$ and $2_{12} - 2_{11}$ of these molecules may show anomalous absorption.</p>
					<p>For the present investigation, we have calculated energy levels and radiative transition probabilities. However, we have used scaled values for collisional rate coefficients. We found that relative values of collisional rate coefficients can produce the required anomalous absorption in $1_{11} - 1_{10}$ and $2_{12} - 2_{11}$ transitions in the molecules.</p>

				<page>0033-0048</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of bulk viscosity on the early evolution of Universe for a spatially homogeneous and isotropic Robertson-Walker model is considered. Einstein's field equations are solved by using `gamma-law' equation of state $p = (\gamma - 1)\rho$, where the adiabatic parameter gamma $(\gamma)$ depends on the scale factor of the model. The `gamma' function is defined in such a way that it describes a unified solution of early evolution of the Universe for inflationary and radiation-dominated phases. The fluid has only bulk viscous term and the coefficient of bulk viscosity is taken to be proportional to some power function of the energy density. The complete general solutions have been given through three cases. For flat space, power-law as well as exponential solutions are found. The problem of how the introduction of viscosity affects the appearance of singularity, is briefly discussed in particular solutions. The deceleration parameter has a freedom to vary with the scale factor of the model, which describes the accelerating expansion of the Universe.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We develop a scheme to construct the Hamiltonians of the lambda-, vee- and cascade-type three-level configurations using the generators of $SU(3)$ group. It turns out that this approach provides a well-defined selection rule to give different Hamiltonians for each configuration. The lambda- and vee-type configurations are exactly solved with different initial conditions while taking the two-mode classical and quantized fields. For the classical field, it is shown that the Rabi oscillation of the lambda model is similar to that of the vee model and the dynamics of the vee model can be recovered from lambda model and vice versa simply by inversion. We then proceed to solve the quantized version of both models by introducing a novel Euler matrix formalism. It is shown that this dynamical symmetry exhibited in the Rabi oscillation of two configurations for the semiclassical models is completely destroyed on quantization of the field modes. The symmetry can be restored within the quantized models when both field modes are in the coherent states with large average photon number which is depicted through the collapse and revival of the Rabi oscillations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper demonstrates theoretical characterization of intensity modulation of semiconductor lasers (SL’s). The study is based on a small-signal model to solve the laser rate equations taking into account suppression of optical gain. Analytical forms of the small-signal modulation response and modulation bandwidth are derived. Influences of the bias current, modulation index and modulation frequency as well as gain suppression on modulation characteristics are examined. Computer simulation of the model is applied to $1.55-\mu$m InGaAsP lasers. The results show that when the SL is biased far-above threshold, the increase of gain suppression increases both the modulation response and its peak frequency. The modulation bandwidth also increases but the laser damping rate decreases. Quantitative description of the relationships of both modulation bandwidth vs. relaxation frequency and maximum modulation bandwidth vs. nonlinear gain coefficient are presented.</p>

					<p>Characterization of the current drive regime is done for helicon wave-generated plasma in a torus, at a very high operating frequency. A radiofrequency-compensated Langmuir probe is designed and used for the measurement of plasma parameters along with the electron energy distributions in radial scans of the plasma. The electron energy distribution patterns obtained in the operational regime suggest that Landau damping cannot be responsible for the efficient helicon discharge in the present study. A typical peaked radial density profile, high plasma temperature and absence of an appreciable amount of energetic electrons for resonant wave–particle interactions, suggest that the chosen operational regime is suitable for the study of nonresonant current drive by helicon wave. Successful and significant current drive achieved in our device clearly demonstrates the capability of nonresonant current drive by helicon waves in the present operational regime.</p>

					<p>An analysis of neutron diffraction data of liquid deuterated 1-propanol at room temperature to extract its molecular conformation is presented. Being a big molecule with twelve atomic sites, the analysis is tricky and needs careful consideration. The resulting molecular parameters are compared with electron diffraction (gas phase), X-ray diffraction (liquid phase) and MD simulation results. Information about the hydrogen-bonded intermolecular structure in liquid is extracted and nature of the probable molecular association suggested.</p>

				<title>Effect of normal processes on thermal conductivity of germanium, silicon and diamond</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0143-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of normal scattering processes is considered to redistribute the phonon momentum in (a) the same phonon branch – KK-S model and (b) between different phonon branches – KK-H model. Simplified thermal conductivity relations are used to estimate the thermal conductivity of germanium, silicon and diamond with natural isotopes and highly enriched isotopes. It is observed that the consideration of the normal scattering processes involving different phonon branches gives better results for the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of germanium, silicon and diamond with natural and highly enriched isotopes. Also, the estimation of the lattice thermal conductivity of germanium and silicon for these models with the consideration of quadratic form of frequency dependences of phonon wave vector leads to the conclusion that the splitting of longitudinal and transverse phonon modes, as suggested by Holland, is not an essential requirement to explain the entire temperature dependence of lattice thermal conductivity whereas KK-H model gives a better estimation of the thermal conductivity without the splitting of the acoustic phonon modes due to the dispersive nature of the phonon dispersion curves.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0157-0166</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the magnetic and transport properties of the Ti$_{x}$Nb$_{1−x}$CoSn solid solution compounds with half Heusler cubic MgAgAs-type structure have been studied. This work shows the onset of ferromagnetism associated with a semiconductor to metal transition. The transition occurs directly from ferromagnetic metal to semiconducting state as it is the case in the TiCo$_{x}$Ni$_{1−x}$Sn series studied previously. A weak quantity of Ti in NbCoSn is sufficient to allow the appearance of ferromagnetic order and metallic state. The variations of the Curie temperature as a function of saturation and effective paramagnetic moments are related to the itinerant ferromagnetism model. A comparison is made with the TiCoSn$_{x}$Sb$_{1−x}$ series (also studied previously), where the transition from TiCoSn ferromagnetic metal to non-magnetic semiconductor TiCoSb occurs through an intermediate metallic Pauli-like state.</p>

				<page>0167-0173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The EPR $g$ factors $g_{i}$ $(i = x, y, z)$ for the interstitial Ti$^{3+}$ in rutile are theoretically studied from the perturbation formulas of these parameters for a 3d$^{1}$ ion in rhombically compressed octahedra. The ligand octahedron in the impurity center is found to be less compressed than that on the host interstitial site due to the Jahn–Teller effect. The local compression parameter $(\approx 0.026)$ and the rhombic distortion angle $\delta \phi'$ $(\approx 0.7^{\circ})$ around the impurity Ti$^{3+}$ are smaller than the host values ($\approx 0.091$ and $3.5^{\circ}$). The theoretical $g$ factors based on the above local structural parameters are in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the $g$ factors for a tetragonal interstitial Ti$^{3+}$ center are also reasonably interpreted.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present calculation we have used the Monte Carlo method of generating collective spin and total energy of the nucleus for various configurations of the system with $N_{0}$ single particle states available for n number of particles. The different configurations (arrangements of occupied single particle states) leading to a particular energy $E$ and spin $J$ are then collected to get the density of states for the given energy $E$ and spin $J$. We find that if we use the cranked Nilsson model single particle states for the rotational frequency $\Omega = 0.0\hbarω, 0.05\hbarω$ and $0.1\hbarω$ there is a shift in the maximum density of states $W_{\text{max}}$ with a tendency for the system to become more oblate or prolate depending on the shift in the maximum density of states as the angular momentum decreases or increases. The change in nuclear level density with collectivity, i.e. with the use of cranked Nilsson model single particle levels has been noticed.</p>

				<page>0195-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study the synchronization of coupled dynamical systems on networks. The dynamics is governed by a local nonlinear oscillator for each node of the network and interactions connecting different nodes via the links of the network. We consider existence and stability conditions for both single- and multi-cluster synchronization. For networks with time-varying topology we compare the synchronization properties of these networks with the corresponding time-average network. We find that if the different coupling matrices corresponding to the time-varying networks commute with each other then the stability of the synchronized state for both the time-varying and the time-average topologies are approximately the same. On the other hand, for non-commuting coupling matrices the stability of the synchronized state for the time-varying topology is in general better than the time-average topology.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We analyse the origin of the multiple long time scales associated with the long time decay observed in non-polar solvation dynamics by linear stability analysis of solvent density modes where the effects of compressibility and solvent structure are systematically incorporated. The coupling of the solute–solvent interactions at both ground and excited states of the solute with the compressibility and solvent structure is found to have important effects on the time scales. The present theory suggests that the relatively longer time constant is controlled by the solvent compressibility, while the solvent structure at the nearest-neighbour length scale dominates the shorter time constant.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Proceedings of the International Workshop and Conference on Statistical Physics Approaches to Multidisciplinary Problems</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the equivalence between kinetic wealth-exchange models, in which agents exchange wealth during trades, and mechanical models of particles, exchanging energy during collisions. The universality of the underlying dynamics is shown both through a variational approach based on the minimization of the Boltzmann entropy and a microscopic analysis of the collision dynamics of molecules in a gas. In various relevant cases, the equilibrium distribution is well-approximated by a gamma-distribution with suitably defined temperature and number of dimensions. This in turn allows one to quantify the inequalities observed in the wealth distributions and suggests that their origin should be traced back to very general underlying mechanisms, for instance, the fact that smaller the fraction of the relevant quantity (e.g. wealth) that agent can exchange during an interaction, the closer the corresponding equilibrium distribution is to a fair distribution.</p>

				<title>Diffusion of gases into the lung: How physics can help to understand physiology</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Proceedings of the International Workshop and Conference on Statistical Physics Approaches to Multidisciplinary Problems</feature>
				<page>0245-0251</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the human lung, the gas transfer between air and blood is achieved in terminal units that are called `acini'. Whereas convection is still the predominant transport phenomenon at the acinus entrance, most of the acinar surface is in fact accessed by diffusion. The transition between convection and diffusion, and thus the size of the diffusion unit, depends on the air velocity at the acinus entrance. In this paper, we present a gas transport model which takes into account both the diffusion into the acinus and the diffusion across the alveolar membrane. It is shown that the physiological sizes of the diffusion unit in the lung, at rest or at exercise, can be explained by physical arguments. In that sense, diffusion is the `dimensioning criterion' of the lung at the acinar level. This approach shows that, due to diffusional screening at inspiration and at rest, there exists a permanent spatial inhomogeneity of oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressure which reduces the effective surface efficiency of the human acinus to a value of only 30 to $40\%$. This model casts a new light on the properties of this physiological transport system. It permits in particular to understand how several diseases among which pulmonary edema may remain asymptomatic in their early stages.</p>

					<p>Users of the peer-to-peer system join and leave the network randomly, which makes the overlay network dynamic and unstable in nature. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework to assess the robustness of p2p networks in the face of user churn. We model the peer churn through degree-independent as well as degree-dependent node failure. Lately, superpeer networks are becoming the most widely used topology among the p2p networks. Therefore, we perform the stability analysis of superpeer networks as a case study. We validate the analytically derived results with the help of simulation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We study the adaptation dynamics of an initially maladapted population evolving via the elementary processes of mutation and selection. The evolution occurs on rugged fitness landscapes which are defined on the multi-dimensional genotypic space and have many local peaks separated by low fitness valleys. We mainly focus on the Eigen’s model that describes the deterministic dynamics of an infinite number of self-replicating molecules. In the stationary state, for small mutation rates such a population forms a quasispecies which consists of the fittest genotype and its closely related mutants. The quasispecies dynamics on rugged fitness landscape follow a punctuated (or step-like) pattern in which a population jumps from a low fitness peak to a higher one, stays there for a considerable time before shifting the peak again and eventually reaches the global maximum of the fitness landscape. We calculate exactly several properties of this dynamical process within a simplified version of the quasispecies model.</p>

For finite frequency field drive the ratchet effect is obtained only numerically. In the transient time scales the system shows dispersionless behaviour as reported earlier when a constant force is applied. In the periodic drive case the dispersion behaviour is more complex.

				<abstract>
					<p>During the last phase of cell division in bacteria, a polymeric ring forms at the division site. The ring, made of intracellular proteins, anchors to the cell wall and starts to contract. That initiates a dividing septum to close in, like the shutter of a camera, eventually guillotining the cell into two daughters. All through, the ring remains at the leading edge of the septum and seems to power its closure. It is not understood why does the ring contract. We propose a theoretical model to explain this. It is worth mentioning that a similar contraction phenomenon occurs for the actin ring in eukaryotes, but there it is due to motor proteins, which however, are absent in bacteria.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Proceedings of the International Workshop and Conference on Statistical Physics Approaches to Multidisciplinary Problems</feature>
				<page>0331-0340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several networks occurring in real life have modular structures that are arranged in a hierarchical fashion. In this paper, we have proposed a model for such networks, using a stochastic generation method. Using this model we show that, the scaling relation between the clustering and degree of the nodes is not a necessary property of hierarchical modular networks, as had previously been suggested on the basis of a deterministically constructed model. We also look at dynamics on such networks, in particular, the stability of equilibria of network dynamics and of synchronized activity in the network. For both of these, we find that, increasing modularity or the number of hierarchical levels tends to increase the probability of instability. As both hierarchy and modularity are seen in natural systems, which necessarily have to be robust against environmental fluctuations, we conclude that additional constraints are necessary for the emergence of hierarchical structure, similar to the occurrence of modularity through multi-constraint optimization as shown by us previously.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Modelling the evolution of a financial index as a stochastic process is a problem awaiting a full, satisfactory solution since it was first formulated by Bachelier in 1900. Here it is shown that the scaling with time of the return probability density function sampled from the historical series suggests a successful model. The resulting stochastic process is a heteroskedastic, non-Markovian martingale, which can be used to simulate index evolution on the basis of an autoregressive strategy. Results are fully consistent with volatility clustering and with the multiscaling properties of the return distribution. The idea of basing the process construction on scaling, and the construction itself, are closely inspired by the probabilistic renormalization group approach of statistical mechanics and by a recent formulation of the central limit theorem for sums of strongly correlated random variables.</p>

					<p>The dynamics of information traffic over scale-free networks has been investigated systematically. A series of routing strategies of data packets have been proposed, including the local routing strategy, the next-nearest-neighbour routing strategy, and the mixed routing strategy based on local static and dynamic information. The capacity of the network can be quantified by the phase transition from free flow state to congestion state. The optimal parameter values of each model leading to the highest efficiency of scale-free networked traffic systems have been found. Moreover, we have found hysteretic loop in networked traffic systems with finite packets delivering ability.

				<title>Effect of macromolecular crowding on the rate of diffusion-limited enzymatic reaction</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Proceedings of the International Workshop and Conference on Statistical Physics Approaches to Multidisciplinary Problems</feature>
				<page>0359-0368</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The cytoplasm of a living cell is crowded with several macromolecules of different shapes and sizes. Molecular diffusion in such a medium becomes anomalous due to the presence of macromolecules and diffusivity is expected to decrease with increase in macromolecular crowding. Moreover, many cellular processes are dependent on molecular diffusion in the cell cytosol. The enzymatic reaction rate has been shown to be affected by the presence of such macromolecules. A simple numerical model is proposed here based on percolation and diffusion in disordered systems to study the effect of macromolecular crowding on the enzymatic reaction rates. The model qualitatively explains some of the experimental observations.</p>

				<title>Analysis of protein folds using protein contact networks</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Proceedings of the International Workshop and Conference on Statistical Physics Approaches to Multidisciplinary Problems</feature>
				<page>0369-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Proteins are important biomolecules, which perform diverse structural and functional roles in living systems. Starting from a linear chain of amino acids, proteins fold to different secondary structures, which then fold through short- and long-range interactions to give rise to the final three-dimensional shapes useful to carry out the biophysical and biochemical functions. Proteins are defined as having a common `fold' if they have major secondary structural elements with same topological connections. It is known that folding mechanisms are largely determined by a protein's topology rather than its interatomic interactions. The native state protein structures can, thus, be modelled, using a graph-theoretical approach, as coarse-grained networks of amino acid residues as `nodes' and the inter-residue interactions/contacts as `links'. Using the network representation of protein structures and their 2D contact maps, we have identified the conserved contact patterns (groups of contacts) representing two typical folds – the EF-hand and the ubiquitin-like folds. Our results suggest that this direct and computationally simple methodology can be used to infer about the presence of specific folds from the protein's contact map alone.</p>

					<p>This communication reports the photophysical characterization of self-assembled layer-by-layer (LbL) films of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) fabricated at different temperatures by electrostatic interaction with a polycation, poly(allylamine hydrochloride). It was observed that there was a successful incorporation of DNA molecules in DNA–PAH LbL films at room temperature as well as after melting temperature. An abrupt increase in intensity was observed in the absorption spectra of the films fabricated at high temperature which is an indication of the immobilization of unzipped DNA after melting of DNA. The films were observed to remain unaffected even after 250 h of film fabrication. The total electrostatic interaction time between DNA and PAH is about 15 min, that is, no PAH binding site is free.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Proceedings of the International Workshop and Conference on Statistical Physics Approaches to Multidisciplinary Problems</feature>
				<page>0391-0401</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Empirical study shows that many real networks in nature and society share two generic properties: they are scale-free and they display a high degree of clustering. Quite often they are modular in nature also, implying occurrences of several small tightly linked groups which are connected in a hierarchical manner among themselves. Recently, we have introduced a model of spatial scale-free network where nodes pop-up at randomly located positions in the Euclidean space and are connected to one end of the nearest link of the existing network. It has been already argued that the large scale behaviour of this network is like the Barabási–Albert model. In the present paper we briefly review these results as well as present additional results on the study of non-trivial correlations present in this model which are found to have similar behaviours as in the real-world networks. Moreover, this model naturally possesses the hierarchical characteristics lacked by most of the models of the scale-free networks.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Proceedings of the International Workshop and Conference on Statistical Physics Approaches to Multidisciplinary Problems</feature>
				<page>0403-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we review the quenching dynamics of a quantum $XY$ spin-1/2 chain in the presence of a transverse field, when the transverse field or the anisotropic interaction is quenched at a slow but uniform rate. We also extend the results to the cases in which the system starts with any arbitrary initial condition as opposed to the initial fully magnetically aligned state which has been extensively studied earlier. The evolution is non-adiabatic in the time interval when the parameters are close to their critical values, and is adiabatic otherwise. The density of defects produced due to non-adiabatic transitions is calculated by mapping the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau–Zener problem. We show that in one dimension the density of defects in the final state scales as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$ irrespective of the initial condition, where $\tau$ is the quenching time-scale. However, the magnitude of density of defects is found to depend on the initial condition.</p>

				<title>Synchronization in multicell systems exhibiting dynamic plasticity</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Proceedings of the International Workshop and Conference on Statistical Physics Approaches to Multidisciplinary Problems</feature>
				<page>0423-0435</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Collective behaviour in multicell systems arises from exchange of chemicals/signals between cells and may be different from their intrinsic behaviour. These chemicals are products of regulated networks of biochemical pathways that underlie cellular functions, and can exhibit a variety of dynamics arising from the non-linearity of the reaction processes. We have addressed the emergent synchronization properties of a ring of cells, diffusively coupled by the end product of an intracellular model biochemical pathway exhibiting non-robust birhythmic behaviour. The aim is to examine the role of intercellular interaction in stabilizing the non-robust dynamics in the emergent collective behaviour in the ring of cells. We show that, irrespective of the inherent frequencies of individual cells, depending on the coupling strength, the collective behaviour does synchronize to only one type of oscillations above a threshold number of cells. Using two perturbation analyses, we also show that this emergent synchronized dynamical state is fairly robust under external perturbations. Thus, the inherent plasticity in the oscillatory phenotypes in these model cells may get suppressed to exhibit collective dynamics of a single type in a multicell system, but environmental influences can sometimes expose this underlying plasticity in its collective dynamics.</p>

				<title>Characterizing and modelling cyclic behaviour in non-stationary time series through multi-resolution analysis</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0459-0485</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A method based on wavelet transform is developed to characterize variations at multiple scales in non-stationary time series. We consider two different financial time series, S$\&$P CNX Nifty closing index of the National Stock Exchange (India) and Dow Jones industrial average closing values. These time series are chosen since they are known to comprise of stochastic fluctuations as well as cyclic variations at different scales. The wavelet transform isolates cyclic variations at higher scales when random fluctuations are averaged out; this corroborates correlated behaviour observed earlier in financial time series through random matrix studies. Analysis is carried out through Haar, Daubechies-4 and continuous Morlet wavelets for studying the character of fluctuations at different scales and show that cyclic variations emerge at intermediate time scales. It is found that Daubechies family of wavelets can be effectively used to capture cyclic variations since these are local in nature. To get an insight into the occurrence of cyclic variations, we then proceed to model these wavelet coefficients using genetic programming (GP) approach and using the standard embedding technique in the reconstructed phase space. It is found that the standard methods (GP as well as artificial neural networks) fail to model these variations because of poor convergence. A novel interpolation approach is developed that overcomes this difficulty. The dynamical model equations have, primarily, linear terms with additive Padé-type terms. It is seen that the emergence of cyclic variations is due to an interplay of a few important terms in the model. Very interestingly GP model captures smooth variations as well as bursty behaviour quite nicely.</p>

					<p>We propose a better differential method for the computation of the equation of state of QCD from lattice simulations. In contrast to the earlier differential method, our technique yields positive pressure for all temperatures including the temperatures in the transition region. Employing it on temporal lattices of 8, 10 and 12 sites and by extrapolating to zero lattice spacing we obtained the pressure, energy density, entropy density, specific heat and speed of sound in quenched QCD for $0.9 \leq T/T_{c} \leq 3$. At high temperatures comparisons of our results are made with those from the dimensional reduction approach and also with those from a conformal symmetric theory.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Laser material processing involving welding, ablation and cutting involves interaction of intense laser pulses of nanosecond duration with a condensed phase. Such interaction involving high brightness radiative flux causes multitude of non-linear events involving thermal phase transition at soild–liquid–gas interfaces. A theoretical perspective involving thermal dynamics of the vaporization process and consequent non-linear multiple thermal phase transitions under the action of laser plasma is the subject matter of the present work. The computational calculations were carried out where titanium (Ti) was treated as a condensed medium. The solution to the partial differential equations governing the thermal dynamics and the underlying phase transition event in the multiphase system is based on non-stationary Eulerian variables. The Mach number $M$ depicts significant fluctuations due to thermal instabilities associated with the laser beam flux and intensity. A conclusive amalgamation has been established which relates material surface temperature profile to laser intensity, laser flux and the pressure in the plasma cloud.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of time-periodic forcing in a few-mode model for zero-Prandtl-number convection with rigid body rotation is investigated. The time-periodic modulation of the rotation rate about the vertical axis and gravity modulation are considered separately. In the presence of periodic variation of the rotation rate, the model shows modulated waves with a band of frequencies. The increase in the external forcing amplitude widens the frequency band of the modulated waves, which ultimately leads to temporally chaotic waves. The gravity modulation, on the other hand, with small frequencies, destroys the quasiperiodic waves at the onset and leads to chaos through intermittency. The spectral power density shows more power to a band of frequencies in the case of periodic modulation of the rotation rate. In the case of externally imposed vertical vibration, the spectral density has more power at lower frequencies. The two types of forcing show different routes to chaos.</p>

					<p>This article reports a comparative study of the phase separation process in a polymer-dispersed liquid crystal, based on a Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation study of three lattice systems. We propose a model for the different processes occurring in the formation of polymer-dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs). The mechanism of PDLC is studied as a function of quench temperature, concentration and degree of polymerization of liquid crystals and polymers. The obtained resultant phase diagrams of the three systems are approximated and compared with the Flory–Huggins theory, and show a good agreement. It has been observed in the simulation results that among all the three systems, the $40 \times 40 \times 40$ lattice showed the most accurate, reliable and stable results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) were fabricated using pentacene as the active layer with two different gate dielectrics, namely SiO$_{2}$ and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), in top contact geometry for comparative studies. OTFTs with SiO$_{2}$ as dielectric and gold deposited on the rough side of highly doped silicon (n$^{+}$ -Si) as gate electrode exhibited reasonable field effect mobilities. To deal with poor stability and large leakage currents between source/drain and gate electrodes in these devices, isolated OTFTs with reduced source/drain contact area were fabricated by selective deposition of pentacene on SiO$_{2}$/PMMA through shadow mask. This led to almost negligible leakage currents and no degradation in electrical performance even after 14 days of storage under ambient conditions. But, the field effect mobilities obtained were lower than 10$^{−3}$ cm$^{2}$ V$^{−1}$ s$^{−1}$, whereas by using PMMA as gate dielectric with chromium deposited on the polished side of n$^{+}$ -Si as gate electrode, improved field effect mobilities ($> 0.02$ cm$^{2}$ V$^{−1}$ s$^{−1}$) were obtained. PMMA-based OTFTs also exhibited lower leakage currents and reproducible output characteristics even after 30 days of storage under ambient conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the results of investigation on the influence of temperature on magnetoelastic characteristics of the two ring-shaped cores, made of Fe$_{70}$Ni$_{8}$Si$_{10}$B$_{12}$ amorphous alloy. The cores were annealed for 1 h at 350 and 400$^{\circ}$ C, respectively. The compressive force $F$ was applied perpendicular to the direction of the magnetizing field $H$ in the sample. Special cylindrical backing enables application of the uniform compressive stress $\sigma$ to the wound ring sample. A resistive furnace heated the experimental set-up. Results presented in the paper indicate a significant influence of the temperature on the magnetoelastic characteristics of Fe$_{70}$Ni$_{8}$Si$_{10}$B$_{12}$ amorphous alloy. Information about the magnetoelastic characteristics of this material may be useful in the magnetoelastic sensor development. Also this will create new possibilities in the development of physical model of magnetoelastic effect.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>AC impedance spectroscopy technique has been used to study electrical properties of Bi$_{3.25}$La$_{0.75}$Ti$_{3}$O$_{12}$ (BLT) ceramic. Complex impedance plots were fitted with three depressed semicircles, which are attributed to crystalline layer, plate boundary and grain boundary and all three were found to comprise of universal capacitance nature $[C = C_{0}w^{n−1}]$. Grain boundary resistance and capacitance evaluated from complex impedance plots have larger values than that of plate boundary and crystalline layer. The activation energies ($E_{a}$) for DC-conductance in grain boundary, plate boundary and crystalline layer are 0.68 eV, 0.89 eV and 0.89 eV, respectively. Relaxation activation energies calculated from impedance plots showed similar values, 0.81 eV and 0.80 eV for crystalline layer and plate boundary, respectively. These activation energy values are found to be consistent with the $E_{a}$ value of oxygen vacancies in perovskite materials. A mechanism is offered to explain the generation of oxygen vacancies in BLT ceramic and its role in temperature dependence of DC-conductance study.</p>

				<page>0617-0622</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The co-location of reactor- and accelerator-based neutron sources offers a great opportunity for complementary use of steady and pulsed neutron beams in a wide variety of neutron science and technology areas ranging from basic research to industrial applications. In Japan, such a balance of two kinds of neutron sources has a long tradition and now we are entering into a new era with the commissioning of the world’s most intense pulsed neutron beams at JSNS/J-PARC plus the existing JRR-3 reactor both co-located within 1 km of each other in Tokai. The joint operation of these neutron facilities in close proximity under a program called `neutron platform', will allow neutron beam access not only to professional users, familiar with both pulsed and steady state techniques but also to first-time academics and industrial researchers to neutron scattering.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The focus of this article is on further improvements of methods in neutron imaging: the increased spatial resolution for microtomography and options for energy- selective neutron imaging. Before going into details, some common statements are given in respect to the state-of-the-art in neutron imaging. A relation to the X-ray methods is mentioned, where complementary results are obtained. The potential for the energy selection is of particular interest for future installations at the new pulsed sources, based on spallation (SNS, J-PARC, ISIS-TS2). First results from preliminary studies look very promising for future material and industrial research. Therefore, statements about the set-up of the best possible imaging systems are included in the article.</p>

				<title>Neutron scattering study of the excitation spectrum of solid helium at ultra-low temperatures</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0673-0678</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There has b3een a resurgence of interest in the properties of solid helium due to the recent discovery of non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI) in solid $^{4}$He by Chan and coworkers below 200 mK which they have interpreted as a transition to a `supersolid' phase. We have carried out a series of elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of hcp $^{4}$He at temperatures down to 60 mK. While we have found no direct evidence of any change in the excitation spectrum at low temperatures, we have found that the excitation spectrum of solid $^{4}$He shows several interesting features, including extra branches in addition to the phonon branches. We interpret these extra branches as single particle excitations due to propagating vacancy waves, which map on to the famous `roton minimum' long known in the excitation spectrum of superfluid liquid $^{4}$He. The results show that in fact solid $^{4}$He shares several features in common with the superfluid.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using small angle neutron scattering we have been able to observe for the first time a well-defined vortex lattice (VL) structure both in the hole-doped LSCO and electron-doped NCCO superconductors. Our measurements on optimally doped LSCO reveal the existence of a magnetic field-induced phase transition from a hexagonal to a square coordination of the VL. Various scenarios to explain such phase transition are presented. In NCCO also a clear square VL could be detected, which is unexpectedly kept down to the lowest measurable magnetic fields.</p>

				<title>Phonon linewidths in YNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0687-0693</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Phonons in a metal interact with conduction electrons which give rise to a finite linewidth. In the normal state, this leads to a Lorentzian shape of the phonon line. Density functional theory is able to predict the phonon linewidths as a function of wave vector for each branch of the phonon dispersion. An experimental verification of such predictions is feasible only for compounds with very strong electron–phonon coupling. YN$_{2}$B$_{2}$C was chosen as a test example because it is a conventional superconductor with a fairly high $T_{c}$ (15.2 K). Inelastic neutron scattering experiments did largely confirm the theoretical predictions. Moreover, they revealed a strong temperature dependence of the linewidths of some phonons with particularly strong electron–phonon coupling which can as yet only qualitatively be accounted for by theory. For such phonons, marked changes of the phonon frequencies and linewidths were observed from room temperature down to 15 K. Further changes were observed on entering into the superconducting state. These changes can, however, not be described simply by a change of the phonon linewidth.</p>

				<title>Corelli: Efficient single crystal diffraction with elastic discrimination</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0705-0711</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Single crystal diffuse scattering provides one of the most powerful probes of short-range correlations on the 1-100 nm scale, which often are responsible for the extreme field response of many emerging phenomena of great interest. Accurate modeling of such complex disorder from diffuse scattering data however puts stringent experimental demands, requiring measurements over large volumes of reciprocal space with sufficient momentum and energy resolution. Here, we discuss the potential of the cross-correlation technique for efficient measurement of single crystal diffuse scattering with energy discrimination, as will be implemented in a novel instrument, Corelli. Utilizing full experiment simulations, we show that this technique readily leads up to a fifty-fold gain in efficiency, as compared to traditional methods, for measuring single crystal diffuse scattering over volumes of reciprocal space with elastic discrimination.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>To make headway on any problem in physics, high-quality single crystals are required. In this talk, special emphasis will be placed on the crystal growth of various oxides (superconductors and magnetic materials), borides and carbides using the image furnaces at Warwick. The floating zone method of crystal growth used in these furnaces produces crystals of superior quality, circumventing many of the problems associated with, for example, flux growth from the melt. This method enables the growth of large volumes of crystal, a prerequisite especially for experiments using neutron beams. Some examples of experimental results from crystals grown at Warwick, selected from numerous in-house studies and our collaborative research projects with other UK and international groups will be discussed.</p>

				<title>Life at extreme conditions: Neutron scattering studies of biological molecules suggest that evolution selected dynamics</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0739-0743</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The short review concentrates on recent work performed at the neutrons in biology laboratories of the Institut Laue Langevin and Institut de Biologie Structurale in Grenoble. Extremophile organisms have been discovered that require extreme conditions of temperature, pressure or solvent environment for survival. The existence of such organisms poses a significant challenge in understanding the physical chemistry of their proteins, in view of the great sensitivity of protein structure and stability to the aqueous environment and to external conditions in general. Results of neutron scattering measurements on the dynamics of proteins from extremophile organisms, in vitro as well as in vivo, indicated remarkably how adaptation to extreme conditions involves forces and fluctuation amplitudes that have been selected specifically, suggesting that evolutionary macromolecular selection proceeded via dynamics. The experiments were performed on a halophilic protein, and membrane adapted to high salt, a thermophilic enzyme adapted to high temperature and its mesophilic (adapted to 37$^{\circ}$C) homologue; and in vivo for psychrophilic, mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria, adapted respectively to temperatures of 4$^{\circ}$C, 37$^{\circ}$C, 75$^{\circ}$C and 85$^{\circ}$C. Further work demonstrated the existence of a water component of exceptionally low mobility in an extreme halophile from the Dead Sea, which is not present in mesophile bacterial cells.</p>

				<title>Anodic oxide growth on Zr in neutral aqueous solution</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0769-0776</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Anodization and subsequent cathodic reactions on a thin-film sample of Zr were studied with {\textit{in-situ}} neutron reflectometry (NR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The NR results during anodization showed the originally 485 Å thick Zr film generally behaved similar to a bulk electrode in neutral solution. The anodization ratio measured at applied potentials increased in steps of 0.5 V was somewhat higher than the value determined by coulometry, while the Pilling Bedworth ratio is in good agreement with published data. Thickening of the oxide layer, accelerated immediately after each potential increase, gradually decreased over several hours, but remained non-zero even after $\sim 12$ h. The thickened oxide eventually cracked when its thickness reached $\sim 120$ Å, causing loss of passivation. Surprisingly, neither the anodization ratio nor the Pilling Bedworth ratio showed any discontinuity at the time of oxide cracking, and the EIS behaviour remained qualitatively as before. This observation is taken as the evidence that the cracked and intact regions of the electrode behave more or less independently as parallel electrodes. When the potential was eventually switched to cathodic polarity, NR shows, as expected, that the effects of oxide cracking were irreversible. However, the electrode resistance recovered partially suggesting the cracks were rapidly plugged with  newly formed oxide.</p>

					<p>A polarized neutron reflectometer for vertical samples is available at Dhruva reactor guide hall, Trombay. The reflectometer has been designed for horizontal scattering vector. It uses a position-sensitive detector for obtaining the reflectivity pattern. This arrangement allows one to obtain diffuse or off-specular intensity around any specular peak at one go. We have used this instrument for studying the structure of various metal-metal and metal-semiconductor multilayers by specular reflectometry. We have also been successful in understanding interface morphology of several films through diffuse neutron reflectometry (DNR) on this reflectometer. Some of the recent results are presented in this paper to demonstrate the strength of these two techniques.</p>

				<title>Non-classical neutron beams for fundamental and solid state research</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0785-0796</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The curious dual nature of the neutron, sometimes a particle, sometimes a wave, is wonderfully manifested in the various non-local interference and quantum contextuality effects observed in neutron interferometry. Non-classical states may become useful for novel fundamental and solid state research. Here we discuss unavoidable quantum losses as they appear in neutron phase-echo and spin rotation experiments and we show how entanglement effects in a single particle system demonstrate quantum contextuality. In all cases of interactions, parasitic beams are produced which cannot be recombined completely with the original beam. This means that a complete reconstruction of the original state would, in principle, be impossible which causes a kind of intrinsic irreversibility. Even small interaction potentials can have huge effects when they are applied in quantum Zeno-like experiments. Recently, it has been shown that an entanglement between external and internal degrees of freedom exists even in single particle systems. This contextuality phenomenon also shows that a quantum system carries much more information than usually extracted. The path towards advanced neutron quantum optics will be discussed.</p>

				<title>In the wonderland of ultra-parallel neutron beams</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0797-0807</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bragg reflections from single crystals yield angular widths of a few arcsec for thermal neutron beams. The Bonse-Hart proposal to attain a sharp, nearly rectangular profile by Bragg reflecting neutrons multiply from a channel-cut single crystal, was realized in its totality three and a half decades later by achieving the corresponding Darwin reflection curves for 5.23 Å neutrons. This facilitated SUSANS (Super USANS) measurements in the $Q \sim 10^{-5}$ Å$^{-1}$ range. The polarized neutron option was introduced into the SUSANS set-up by separating the up- and down-spin neutron beams by $\sim 10$ arcsec with a magnetic (air) prism. The neutron angular width has recently been reduced further by an order of magnitude to $\sim 0.6$ arcsec by diffracting 5.3 Å neutrons from a judiciously optimized Bragg prism. This constitutes the most parallel monochromatic neutron beam produced to date. I present the first SUSANS spectra probing the $Q \sim 10^{-6}$ Å$^{-1}$ domain, recorded with this beam.</p>

				<title>Molecular motion in restricted geometries</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0809-0818</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics in restricted geometries is known to exhibit anomalous behaviour. Diffusion, translational or rotational, of molecules is altered significantly on confinement in restricted geometries. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) offers a unique possibility of studying molecular motion in such systems. Both time scales involved in the motion and the geometry of motion can be studied using QENS. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation not only provides insight into the details of the different types of motion possible but also does not suffer limitations of the experimental set-up. Here we report the effect of confinement on molecular dynamics in various restricted geometries as studied by QENS and MD simulations: An example where the QENS technique provided direct evidence of phase transition associated with change in the dynamical behaviour of the molecules is also discussed.</p>

				<title>Inelastic neutron scattering and lattice dynamics of minerals</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0819-0828</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We review current research on minerals using inelastic neutron scattering and lattice dynamics calculations. Inelastic neutron scattering studies in combination with first principles and atomistic calculations provide a detailed understanding of the phonon dispersion relations, density of states and their manifestations in various thermodynamic properties. The role of theoretical lattice dynamics calculations in the planning, interpretation and analysis of neutron experiments are discussed. These studies provide important insights in understanding various anomalous behaviour including pressure-induced amorphization, phonon and elastic instabilities, prediction of novel high pressure phase transitions, high pressure{temperature melting, etc.</p>

				<title>Negative thermal expansion in framework compounds</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0829-0835</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied negative thermal expansion (NTE) compounds with chemi- cal compositions of NX$_{2}$O$_{8}$ and NX$_{2}$O$_{7}$ (N=Zr, Hf and X=W, Mo, V) and M$_{2}$O (M=Cu, Ag) using the techniques of inelastic neutron scattering and lattice dynamics. There is a large variation in the negative thermal expansion coefficients of these compounds. The inelastic neutron scattering experiments have been carried out using polycrystalline and single crystal samples at ambient pressure as well as at high pressures. Experimental data are useful to confirm the predictions made from our lattice dynamical calculations as well as to check the quality of the interatomic potentials developed by us. We have been able to successfully model the NTE behaviour of these compounds. Our studies show that unusual phonon softening of low energy modes is able to account for NTE in these compounds.</p>

				<title>Neutron diffraction study of multipole order in light rare-earth hexaborides</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0837-0845</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Multipole interactions are known to play a central role in the unconventional properties of light rare-earth hexaborides and especially of C$_{e}$B$_{6}$. Substituting Pr at the Ce sites has the effect of enhancing exchange interactions and changing the symmetry of the local 4f charge distribution, while suppressing the octupole moment. The (T,H) magnetic phase diagrams of the Ce$_{x}$Pr$_{1-x}$B$_{6}$ compounds display a large variety of ordered phases involving magnetic and/or charge degrees of freedom. Here we focus on the compound Ce$_{0.7}$Pr$_{0:3B6}, which is located slightly beyond the Pr concentration where the antiferroquadrupolar phase of pure CeB6 is suppressed in zero field. The different magnetic structures have been characterized by neutron diffraction and their origin is discussed in connection with recent non-resonant X-ray results by Tanaka et al.</p>

				<title>Results from PAMELA, ATIC and FERMI: Pulsars or dark matter?</title>
				<feature>Topical Review</feature>
				<page>0001-0022</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well known that dark matter dominates the dynamics of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Its constituents remain a mystery despite an assiduous search for them over the past three decades. Recent results from the satellite-based PAMELA experiment show an excess in the positron fraction at energies between 10 and 100 GeV in the secondary cosmic ray spectrum. Other experiments, namely ATIC, HESS and FERMI, show an excess in the total electron $(e^+ + e^−)$ spectrum for energies greater than 100 GeV. These excesses in the positron fraction as well as the electron spectrum can arise in local astrophysical processes like pulsars, or can be attributed to the annihilation of the dark matter particles. The latter possibility gives clues to the possible candidates for the dark matter in galaxies and other astrophysical systems. In this article, we give a report of these exciting developments.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0037-0045</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three-dimensional non-Hermitian systems are investigated using classical perturbation theory based on Lie transformations. Analytic expressions for total energy in terms of action variables are derived. Both real and complex semiclassical eigenvalues are obtained by quantizing the action variables. It was found that semiclassical energy eigenvalues calculated with the classical perturbation theory are in very good agreement with exact energies and for certain non-Hermitian systems second-order classical perturbation theory performed better than the secondorder Rayleigh–Schroedinger perturbation theory.</p>

				<title>Iterative approach for the eigenvalue problems</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0047-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An approximation method based on the iterative technique is developed within the framework of linear delta expansion (LDE) technique for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional and three-dimensional realistic physical problems. This technique allows us to obtain the coefficient in the perturbation series for the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues directly by knowing the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of the unperturbed problems in quantum mechanics. Examples are presented to support this. Hence, the LDE technique can be used for non-perturbative as well as perturbative systems to find approximate solutions of eigenvalue problems.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear quantum mechanics, the superposition principle, and the quantum measurement problem</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0067-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There are four reasons why our present knowledge and understanding of quantum mechanics can be regarded as incomplete. (1) The principle of linear superposition has not been experimentally tested for position eigenstates of objects having more than about a thousand atoms. (2) There is no universally agreed upon explanation for the process of quantum measurement. (3) There is no universally agreed upon explanation for the observed fact that macroscopic objects are not found in superposition of position eigenstates. (4) Most importantly, the concept of time is classical and hence external to quantum mechanics: there should exist an equivalent reformulation of the theory which does not refer to an external classical time. In this paper we argue that such a reformulation is the limiting case of a nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming important at the Planck mass scale. Such a nonlinearity can provide insights into the aforesaid problems. We use a physically motivated model for a nonlinear Schr ¨odinger equation to show that nonlinearity can help in understanding quantum measurement. We also show that while the principle of linear superposition holds to a very high accuracy for atomic systems, the lifetime of a quantum superposition becomes progressively smaller, as one goes from microscopic to macroscopic objects. This can explain the observed absence of position superpositions in macroscopic objects (lifetime is too small). It also suggests that ongoing laboratory experiments may be able to detect the ﬁnite superposition lifetime for mesoscopic objects in the near future.</p>

				<title>Next-to-next-leading order correction to 3-jet rate and event-shape distribution</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0093-0107</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The hadronic events from the $e^+ e^−$ annihilation data at the centre-of-mass energies ranging from 60 to 197 GeV were studied. The AMY and OPAL Collaborations offered a unique opportunity to test QCD by measuring the energy dependence of different observables. The coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, was measured by two different methods: first by employing the three-jet observables. Combining all the data, the value of as at next-to-next leading order (NNLO) was determined to be $0.117 \pm 0.004$(hard) $\pm$ 0.006$(theo). Secondly, from the event-shape distributions, the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, was extracted at NNLO and it’s evaluation was tested with the energy scale. The results were consistent with the running of $\alpha_s$, expected from QCD predictions. Averaging over different observables, $\alpha_s$ was determined to be $0.115 \pm 0.007$(hard) $\pm 0.003$(theo).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>By using noninteger n-Slater type orbitals in combined Hartree–Fock–Roothaan method, self-consistent ﬁeld calculations of orbital and lowest states energies have been performed for the isoelectronic series of open shell systems $K[Ar]4s^0 3d^1 ({}^2D) (Z = 19–30)$ and $Cr^+[Ar]4s^0 3d^5 ({}^6 S) (Z = 24–30)$. The results of the calculations for the orbital and total energies obtained by using minimal basis-sets of noninteger $n$-Slater type orbitals are given in the tables. The results are compared with the extended-basis Hartree–Fock computations. The orbital and total energies are in good agreement with those presented in the literature. The results can be useful in the study of various properties of heavy atomic systems when the combined Hartree–Fock–Roothaan approach is employed.</p>

					<p>In this work, we studied the influence of heat loaded into the laser crystal in an endpumped solid-state Nd:YVO$_4$ high power laser. We have shown experimentally that the optimum value of the laser-diode temperature for the maximum pump power absorption by the Nd:YVO$_4$ crystal and the maximum Nd:YVO$_4$ laser output power are approximately similar to that of a system of the low power type, but by increasing the pump power, different values can be obtained.</p>

				<title>Atomistic simulation of the point defects in TaW ordered alloy</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0127-0138</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with modified analytic embeddedatom method (MAEAM), the formation, migration and activation energies of the point defects for six-kind migration mechanisms in B$_2$-type TaW alloy have been investigated. The results showed that the anti-site defects TaW and W$_{\text{Ta}}$ were easier to form than Ta and W vacancies owing to their lower formation energies. Comparing the migration and activation energies needed for six-kind migration mechanisms of a Ta (or W) vacancy, we found that one nearest-neighbour jump (1NNJ) was the most favourable because of its lowest migration and activation energies, but it would lead to a disorder in the alloy. One next-nearest-neighbour jump (1NNNJ) and one third-nearest-neighbour jump (1TNNJ) could maintain the ordered property of the alloy but required higher migration and activation energies. So the 1NNNJ and 1TNNJ should be replaced by straight [100] six nearestneighbor cyclic jumps (S[100]6NNCJ) (especially) or bent [100] six nearest-neighbour cyclic jumps (B[100]6NNCJ) and [110] six nearest-neighbor cyclic jumps ([110]6NNCJ), respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Role of correlated hopping is studied using extended Falicov–Kimball model in a small cluster. A discontinuous insulator-to-metal transition is observed at a critical $f$-level energy. Transition is sharper for larger correlated hopping. In the specific heat curves a two-peak structure consisting of a sharp peak followed by a Schottky-type broad peak is exhibited. In a limited parameter region, some heavy-fermion like characteristics have been observed</p>

					<p>By using crystal-ﬁeld theory, the optical spectra and spin-Hamiltonian parameters (abbr.

The theoretical results agree well with the experimental values. The crystal-ﬁeld parameters and the signs of the hyperﬁne structure constants for both ${}^{171} Yb^{3+}$ and ${}^{173} Yb^{3+}$ isotopes are determined.

				<title>Structural, electrical and optical studies on spray-deposited aluminium-doped ZnO thin film</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0153-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thin films of zinc oxide (ZnO) were deposited on cleaned glass substrates by chemical spray pyrolysis technique using Zn(CH$_3$COO)$_2$ as precursor solution. Also, aluminium-doped thin films of ZnO were prepared by using AlCl$_3$ as doping solution for aluminium. The dopant concentration [Al/Zn atomic percentage (at&#37;)] was varied from 0 to 1.5 at&#37; in thin films of ZnO prepared in different depositions. Structural characterization of the deposited films was performed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. It confirmed that all the films were of zinc oxide having polycrystalline nature and possessing typical hexagonal wurtzite structure with crystallite size varying between 100.7 and 268.6 nm. The films exhibited changes in relative intensities and crystallite size with changes in the doping concentration of Al. The electrical studies established that 1 at&#37; of Aldoping was the optimum for enhancing electrical conduction in ZnO thin films and beyond that the distortion caused in the lattice lowered the conductivity. The films also exhibited distinct changes in their optical properties at different doping concentrations, including a blue shift and slight widening of bandgap with increasing Al dopant concentration.</p>

Variations in interface trapped level density ($D_{\text{it}}$) was systematically studied employing high-low (H-L) frequency $C–V$ method. It was found that the distribution of $D_{\text{it}}$ within the bandgap of 4H-SiC varied with oxide thickness. The calculated $D_{\text{it}}$ value near the midgap of 4H-SiC remained almost stable for all oxide thicknesses in the range of $10^9 –10^{10}$ cm$^{−2}$ eV$^{−1}$. The $D_{\text{it}}$ near the conduction band edge had been found to be of the order of $10^{11}$ cm$^{−2}$ eV$^{−1}$ for thicker oxides and for thinner oxides $D_{\text{it}}$ was found to be the range of $10^{10}$ cm$^{−2}$ eV$^{−1}$. The process had direct relevance in the fabrication of MOS-based device structures.</p>

					<p>Primordial black holes evaporate due to Hawking radiation. We find that the evaporation times of primordial black holes increase when accretion of radiation is included. Thus, depending on accretion efficiency, more primordial black holes are existing today, which strengthens the conjecture that the primordial black holes are the proper candidates for dark matter.</p>

				<title>Thermoelastic properties of minerals at high temperature</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0183-0188</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The knowledge of elasticity of the minerals is useful for interpreting the structure and composition of the lower mantle and also in seismic studies. The purpose of the present study is to discuss a simple and straightforward method for evaluating thermoelastic properties of minerals at high temperatures. We have extended the Kumar’s formulation by taking into the account the concept of anharmonicity in minerals above the Debye temperature ($\theta_D$). In our present study, we have investigated the thermophysical properties of two minerals (pyrope-rich garnet and MgAl$_2$O$_4$) under high temperatures and calculated the second-order elastic constant ($C_{ij}$) and bulk modulus ($K_T$) of the above minerals, in two cases ﬁrst by taking Anderson–Gruneisen parameter ($\delta_T$) as temperature-independent and then by treating $\delta_T$ as temperature-dependent parameter. The results obtained when $\delta_T$ is temperature-dependent are in close agreement with experimental data.</p>

				<title>X-ray spectrometry for preventive conservation of cultural heritage</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0191-0200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analytical chemistry does play a key role in the chemical characterization of the environment and it appears that X-ray spectrometry, in its many forms, is one of the most relevant analytical techniques in preventive conservation, as it is in cultural heritage research in general. X-ray spectrometry has indeed been the method of choice for the characterization of the inorganic composition of atmospheric aerosols, for a long time.</p>
					<p>We have, over the last decade, intensively used various forms of X-ray spectrometry, viz., mostly energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence, e.g. with polarized high-energy beam excitation, and automated electron probe X-ray microanalysis, together with other techniques, to identify particle types and their sources in indoor environments, including museums, while gaseous indoor pollutants were assessed using passive diffusion samplers. In each case, both bulk aerosols and individual aerosol particles were studied. For microanalysis of single particles, we have investigated a dozen techniques, but for wide, real-life applications, automated electron probe X-ray microanalysis is the most rewarding.</p>
					<p>We have ﬁrst studied atmospheric aerosols in and around the Correr Museum in Venice, many other museums in Austria, Japan and England, and in the caves with prehistoric rock paintings in Altamira, Spain. Very recently, measurements were done in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Wawel Castle in Cracow, in Italian and Polish mountain churches, in a number of museums in Belgium and the Netherlands, and in cathedrals with medieval stained glass windows. In the Correr museum, it appeared that the particles most threatening for the Bellini paintings were released by the deteriorating plaster renderings, and this could be avoided by simply improving the rendering on the museum walls. In the Wawel Castle, outdoor pollution particles, like ﬁne soot from diesel trafﬁc, entering via leaks in the windows and doors, and also street-deicing salts and coal burning pollution particles, brought in by visitors, mostly in winter, were found to be most worrisome.</p>
					<p>Urgent questions that are not solved at this moment pertain to the deposition processes from the atmosphere to the cultural heritage items, the critical surface interactions that take place on these items, and the establishment of suitable particle concentration standards.</p>

				<title>Total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence and energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence characterizations of nuclear materials</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0201-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nuclear energy is one of the clean options of electricity generation for the betterment of human life. India has an ambitious program for such electricity generation using different types of nuclear reactors. The safe and efﬁcient generation of electricity from these reactors requires quality control of different nuclear materials, e.g. nuclear fuel, structural materials, coolant, moderators etc. These nuclear materials have to undergo strict quality control and should have different speciﬁed parameters for their use in nuclear reactors. The concentration of major and trace elements present in these materials should be within speciﬁed limits. For such chemical quality control of these materials, major and trace elemental analytical techniques are required. Since some of these materials are radioactive, the ideal chemical characterization techniques should have multielement analytical capability, should require very less sample (micrograms level) for analysis so that the radioactive waste generated, and radiation exposure to the detector and operator are minimum. Total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence (TXRF) and energy dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence (EDXRF) with improved features, e.g. application of ﬁlters, secondary target and instrumental geometry require very small amount of sample and thus can be suitably used for the characterization of nuclear materials mainly for the determination of elements at trace and major concentration levels. In Fuel Chemistry Division, TXRF analytical methods have been developed for trace element determinations in uranium and thorium oxides, chlorine determination in nuclear fuel and cladding materials, sulphur in uranium, uranium in sea water etc. Similarly, EDXRF analytical methods with radiation ﬁlters (to reduce background) and improved sample preapartion techniques, e.g. fusion bead and taking samples in the form of solution on ﬁlter papers have been used for developing analytical methods for the determination of U and Th in their mixed matrices, Cd in uranium etc. Some ofthese studies have been reported in this paper.</p>

				<title>New applications of the good old wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0213-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence can be characterized by its advantages and drawbacks. Unbeaten spectral resolution in a range below 5 keV, good operational stability, excellent ability of making averaged analysis, and good presentation of peak shape which gives the basis for the chemical speciation are the advantages. Among the drawbacks, the following are important: system with sequential analysis of particular elements, low output of energy supplied to the device, and great cost of instrument which can be amortized only in routine operations. In routine geological and environmental analyses, the WD-XRF performs better than other simpler instrumental or wet techniques. WD-XRF is continuously improved, by applying new multilayer interference mirrors (MIM) for detection and quantiﬁcation of very light elements. Bad spectral resolution of MIM noted earlier is now improved by tailoring their shape to the shape of gratings. The progress in the long wavelength spectral region joined with efﬁcient and precise wavelength resolution systems enables the application of WD-XRF for speciation analysis. In another effort, XRF spectrometry is treated as a tool for obtaining quantitative basis for the judgement on Linnaean systematic classiﬁcation of plants and opens the ﬁeld to a new discipline – quantitative biology.</p>

				<title>Inﬂuence of near-edge processes in the elemental analysis using X-ray emission-based techniques</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0223-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The near-edge processes, such as X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (XAFS) andresonant Raman scattering (RRS), are not incorporated in the available theoretical attenuation coefﬁcients, which are known to be reliable at energies away from the shell/subshell ionization thresholds of the attenuator element. Theoretical coefﬁcients are generally used to estimate matrix corrections in routine quantitative elemental analysis based on various X-ray emission techniques. A tabulation of characteristic X-ray energies across the periodic table is provided where those X-rays are expected to alter the attenuation coefﬁcients due to XAFS from a particular shell/subshell of the attenuator element. The inﬂuence of XAFS to the attenuation coefﬁcient depends upon the atomic environment and the photoelectron wave vector, i.e., difference in energies of incident X-ray and the shell/subshell ionization threshold of the attenuator element. Further, the XAFS at a shell/subshell will signiﬁcantly alter the total attenuation coefﬁcient if the jump ratio at that shell/subshell is large, e.g., the K shell, L$_3$ subshell and M$_5$ subshell. The tabulations can be considered as guidelines so as to know what can be expected due to XAFS in typical photon-induced X-ray emission spectrometry.</p>

				<title>Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence – A tool for interdisciplinary research</title>
				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0241-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Trace elements have been at the focus of attention for decades with considerable emphasis on their role in biology and biomedical sciences, environmental sciences, geology, archaeology and material sciences. They comprise a large number of elements, some having essential physiological functions, whereas others are toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic. A few even have antiproliferative and anticarciniogenic properties. The advent of various instrumental techniques and sophisticated instrumentations has made their detection to very low limits possible, making this a very important multidisciplinary study. Among these techniques the energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence (EDXRF) technique is being widely used for trace element detection in various ﬁelds of science. Keeping the importance of trace elements in mind, the Kolkata centre of UGC-DAE Consortium for Scientiﬁc Research initiated several research schemes in different ﬁelds of trace element research using various techniques, EDXRF being one of the main techniques. A Xenemetrix (erstwhile Jordan Valley) EX 3600 EDXRF spectrometer is being used to carry out the research. This presentation aims to highlight some of the very recent applications of EDXRF in the study of the role of trace elements in pre-cancerous tissues, medicinal plants and also in some environmental studies.</p>

					<p>X-ray ﬂuorescence has been used to measure several elements noninvasively within living human subjects. Some description is given of the constraints imposed by this rather unusual form of analysis together with a brief listing indicating the range of elements for which such analyses have been developed. Measurements of two elements are then presented in more detail. Lead is measured in bone and has become a well-established tool in continuing research into the long term effects of lead. Strontium is also measured in bone and, although presently not in widespread use, offers the potential for essential information in the study of the reported beneﬁts of strontium supplementation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present study utilized the new hard X-ray microspectroscopy beamline facility, X27A, available at NSLS, BNL, USA, for elemental mapping. This facility provided the primary beam in a small spot of the order of $\sim 10 \mu m$, for focussing. With this spatial resolution and high ﬂux throughput, the synchrotron-based X-ray ﬂuorescent intensities for Mn, Fe, Zn, Cr, Ti and Cu were measured using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled 13-element energy-dispersive high-purity germanium detector. The sample is scanned in a `step-and-repeat’ mode for fast elemental mapping measurements and generated elemental maps at 8, 10 and 12 keV, from a small animal shell (snail). The accumulated trace elements, from these biological samples, in small areas have been identiﬁed. Analysis of the small areas will be better suited to establish the physiology of metals in speciﬁc structures like small animal shell and the distribution of other elements.</p>

				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0281-0292</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An energy-dispersive electron probe X-ray microanalysis (ED-EPMA) technique using an energy-dispersive X-ray detector with an ultra-thin window, designated as low-Z particle EPMA, has been developed. The low-Z particle EPMA allows the quantitative determination of concentrations of low-Z elements such as C, N and O, as well as higher-Z elements that can be analysed by conventional ED-EPMA. The quantitative determination of low-Z elements (using full Monte Carlo simulations, from the electron impact to the X-ray detection) in individual particles has improved the applicability of single-particle analysis, especially in atmospheric environmental aerosol research; many environmentally important atmospheric particles, e.g. sulphates, nitrates, ammonium and carbonaceous particles, contain low-Z elements. To demonstrate its practical applicability, the application of the low-Z particle EPMA for the characterization of Asian Dust, urban and subway aerosol particles is shown herein. In addition, it is demonstrated that the Monte Carlo calculation can also be applied in a quantitative single-particle analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), showing that the technique is useful and reliable for the characterization of submicron aerosol particles</p>

					<p>The two-photon decay of the $2S$ state to the ground state in dressed atoms and oneor two-electron ions has been studied for several decades. Relativistic calculations have shown an $Z$-dependence of the spectral shape of this two-photon transition in one- or two-electron ions. We have measured the spectral distribution of the $1s2s {}^1 S_0 \to  1_s {}^2 {}^1 S_0$ two-photon transition in He-like tin at the ESR storage ring using a new approach for such experiments. In this method, relativistic collisions of initially Li-like projectiles with a gaseous target were used to populate exclusively the ﬁrst excited state, $1_s2_s$, of He-like tin, which provided a clean two-photon spectrum. The measured two-photon spectral distribution was compared with fully relativistic calculations. The obtained results show very good agreement with the calculations for He-like tin</p>

				<feature>Invited Papers</feature>
				<page>0339-0344</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kumakhov polycapillary optics is based on the effective passage of X-ray radiation through bundles of monocapillaries of various conﬁgurations. The passage of radiation takes place because of the total external reﬂection of X-rays from the inner capillary walls. In this work,the basic characteristics of intense quasi-parallel X-ray polycapillary microbeams from a laboratory source with microfocus X-ray tube/polycapillary cylindrical structure are investigated theoretically (analytical consideration). The data generated from theoretical estimations are compared  with the experimental results. Several new generations of X-ray analytical devices like, laboratory synchrotron, ﬂuorescent spectrometers, reﬂectometers/refractometers, diffractometers, X-ray microscopes and combinations of several such devices, are developed based on polycapillary optics. Besides, a number of devices can be developed for the most modern research problems such as nanomateriology, namely, X-ray nanoscanner, portable X-ray nanothickness indicator etc. X-ray tubes and the radiators, specially developed for polycapillary optics as efﬁciently as possible, are used in all the devices mentioned above.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A$^{109}$Cd radioisotope-induced energy-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence (EDXRF) study has been performed on samples of cauliﬂower consisting of the flower, the leaves and the associated root soil. The cauliﬂowers were collected from farms near the main dumping site of municipal solid waste in the city of Kolkata, India and also from uncontaminated farms about 50 km away from the city. A uniﬁed calibration approach was undertaken for the elemental analysis of the samples of widely varying matrices. The present study suggests that the elemental concentrations in the root soils and leaves of the samples vary from farm to farm, whereby the concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb in root soils of MSW-contaminated farms are higher by almost an order of magnitude compared to uncontaminated farms. But, the most notable feature of this study is the strikingly similar elemental concentrations in the edible ﬂower part of all samples irrespective of the type of soil.</p>

				<title>6 MeV storage ring dedicated to hard X-ray imaging and far-infrared spectroscopy</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0351-03550</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The tabletop storage ring, 6 MeV MIRRORCLE, is dedicated to hard X-ray imaging as well as far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy. In spite of low electron energy, the 6 MeV MIRRORCLE generates hard X-rays ranging from 10 keV up to its electron energy and milliwatt order submillimetre range FIR rays. Bremsstrahlung is the mechanism for the hard X-ray generation. Images produced with $11 \times$ geometrical magniﬁcation display a sharply enhanced edge effect when generated using a 25 mm rod electron target. Bright far-infrared is generated in the same way using a conventional synchrotron light source, but with MIRRORCLE the spectral ﬂux is found to be $\sim 1000$ times greater than that of a standard thermal source. Partially coherent enhancement is observed in the case of FIR output.</p>

				<title>Trace determination of uranium in fertilizer samples by total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence</title>
				<feature>Contributed Papers</feature>
				<page>0357-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Uranium is reported to be present in phosphate fertilizers. The recovery of uranium from the fertilizers is important because it can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors and also because of environmental concerns. For both these activities suitable method of uranium determinations at trace levels in these fertilizers are required. Studies have been initiated for such TXRF determination of uranium and the results are reported in the present paper. For TXRF determinations the fertilizer samples were processed with nitric acid and the uranium present in it was removed by solvent extraction using tri-n-butyl phosphate as the extractant. The organic phase containing uranium was equilibrated with 1.5&#37; suprapure nitric acid to bring out uranium in aqueous phase. This aqueous phase was mixed with internal standard Y and the TXRF spectra were measured by depositing samples on ﬂoat glass supports. The amounts of uranium in four fertilizer samples of Hungarian origin were determined by processing these TXRF spectra. Uranium concentrations in two fertilizer samples were found to be in the range of $4–6 \mu g/g$, whereas two fertilizer samples did not show the presence of uranium. The precision of the TXRF determination of uranium was found to be better than 8&#37; ($1\sigma$).</p>

				<page>0361-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Applicability of total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence (TXRF) spectrometry for trace elemental analysis of rainwater samples was studied. The study was used to develop these samples as rainwater standards by the National University of Singapore (NUS). Our laboratory was one of the participants to use TXRF for this study. The rainwater sample obtained from NUS was analysed by TXRF and the trace elements Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, V and Pb were determined as required by the NUS. The average precision was found to be within 16&#37; and the TXRF-determined elemental concentrations of these elements were below $20 \mu g/l$. The average deviation of TXRFdetermined values from the certiﬁed values were 20&#37; (excluding the deviation for Fe and V which were comparatively high). Apart from the above elements, S, K, Ca, Rb, Sr, Ba and Br were also determined by TXRF and were found to be in the range of 0.2 to 191 $\mu g/l$. TXRF-determined values of our laboratory played an important role in the certiﬁcation of concentration of seven elements in this rainwater sample which was later developed as a rainwater standard.</p>				</abstract>

				<abstract>
					<p>Numerical studies of anomalous diffusion in undamped but periodically-driven and parametrically-driven pendulum systems are presented. When the frequency of the periodic driving force is varied, the exponent $\mu$, which is the rate of divergence of the mean square displacement with time, is found to vary in an oscillatory manner. We show the presence of such a variation in other statistical measures such as variance of position, kurtosis, and exponents in the power-exponential law of probability distribution of position.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0385-0396</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the inverse synchronization problem of fractional-order dynamical systems is investigated. A general explicit coupling via an open-plus-closed-loop control for inverse synchronization of two arbitrary unidirectionally or bidirectionally coupled fractional-order systems is proposed. The inverse synchronization is proved analytically based on the stability theorem of the fractional differential equations. A key feature of this proposed scheme is that it can be applied not only to nonchaotic but also to chaotic fractional-order systems whenever they exhibit regular or irregular oscillations. Feasibility of the proposed inverse synchronization scheme is illustrated through numerical simulations.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0397-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The scalar products of polarization tensor and unit vectors are presented explicitly in spherical coordinate system expanded in terms of spherical harmonic functions. By applying the obtained formulae, different wave components in the Salpeter wave function can be shown explicitly, and the results are consistent with the results obtained by $L -S$ coupling analysis. The cancelation formula is given, by which the terms with pure $L = J + 1$ wave components in the Salpeter wave function for the bound state with $\eta_P = (-1)^J$ can be obtained by separating the $L = J - 1$ wave components from mixing terms. This separation provides the basis for studying higher-order contributions from the coupling of $L = J - 1$ and $J + 1$ wave states, and for solving the Salpeter equation exactly without approximation.</p>

				<page>0407-0420</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study a particular approach for analysing worldsheet conformal invariance for bosonic string propagating in a curved background using Hamiltonian formalism. We work in the Schrödinger picture of a single-particle description of the problem where the particle moves in an inﬁnite-dimensional space. Background independence is maintained in this approach by adopting DeWitt’s (Phys. Rev. {\bf 85}, 653–661, 1952) coordinate-independent formulation of quantum mechanics. This enables us to construct certain background-independent notion of Virasoro generators, called DeWitt–Virasoro (DWV) generators, and invariant matrix elements of an arbitrary operator constructed out of them in spin-zero representation. We show that the DWV algebra is given by the Witt algebra with additional anomalous terms that vanish for Ricci-ﬂat backgrounds. The actual quantum Virasoro generators should be obtained by ﬁrst introducing the vacuum state and then normal ordering the DWV generators with respect to that. We demonstrate the procedure in ﬂat and pp-wave backgrounds.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Drell–Yan process at LHC, $q\bar{q} \to Z/ \gamma^{\ast} \to \ell^+ \ell^-$, is one of the benchmarks for conﬁrmation of Standard Model at TeV energy scale. Since the theoretical prediction for the rate is precise and the ﬁnal state is clean as well as relatively easy to measure, the process can be studied at the LHC even at relatively low luminosity. Importantly, the Drell–Yan process is an irreducible background to several searches of beyond Standard Model physics and hence the rates at LHC energies need to be measured accurately. In the present study, the methods for measurement of the Drell–Yan mass spectrum and the estimation of the cross-section have been developed for LHC operation at the centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 100 pb$^{-1}$ in the context of CMS experiment</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Decay of neutron-deﬁcient ${}^{128−137}$Gd parents emitting ${}^4$He to ${}^{32}$S clusters are studied within the Coulomb and proximity potential model. The predicted half-lives are compared with other models and most of the values are well within the present experimental limit for measurements ($T_{1/2}$ &#60; $10^{30} s$). The lowest $T_{1/2}$ value for ${}^{28}$Si emission from ${}^{128}$Gd indicates the role of doubly magic ${}^{100}$Sn daughter in cluster decay process. It is also found that neutron excess in the parent nuclei slows down the cluster decay process. Geiger–Nuttal plots for all clusters are found to be linear with different slopes and intercepts. The $\alpha$-decay half-lives of ${}^{148−152}$Gd parents are computed and are in agreement with experimental data. The role of doubly magic ${}^{132}$Sn daughter in cluster decay process is also examined for various neutron-rich Ba, Ce, Nd, Sm and Gd parents emitting clusters ranging from ${}^4$He to ${}^{32}$Si. Alpha-like structures are most probable in the decays leading to ${}^{100}$Sn, while non-$\alpha$-like structures are probable in the decays leading to ${}^{132}$Sn. The neutron–proton asymmetry in parent and daughter nuclei is responsible for the reduced decay rate in the decay leading to ${}^{132}$Sn.</p>

					<p>The neutron skin effect has been investigated for even isotopes of molybdenum at 25.6 MeV ${}^{94−100}$Mo($p, xn$) reaction using the geometry-dependent hybrid model of pre-equilibrium nuclear reactions. Here the initial neutron/proton exciton numbers were calculated from the neutron/proton densities obtained from an effective nucleon–nucleon interaction of the Skyrme type. Initial exciton numbers from different radii of even Mo isotopes were used to obtain the corresponding neutron emission spectra. In this investigation the calculated results are compared with the experimental data as also with each other.

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we report our calculations on several important total cross-sections (TCS$_s$) of positron impact on isoelectronic N$_2$ and CO molecules, treated in the complex spherical potential formalism. Basically the total (complete) cross-section $Q_T$ consists of elastic and inelastic contributions. Our total inelastic cross-section ($Q_{\text{inel}}) contains ionization and electronic excitations together with positronium formation. Our goal here is to bifurcate $Q_{\text{inel}}$ further to deduce total ionization cross-section, using the `complex scattering potential–ionization contribution’ (CSP-ic) method of electron–atom/molecule scattering. The present range of positron energy is 15–2000 eV. All the resulting cross-sections are in a good general accord with the existing data. This work highlights the importance of various scattering channels in $e^+ - N_2$ and $e^+ - CO$ interactions at intermediate and high energies.</p>

The wiggler-induced self-magnetic ﬁeld has a diamagnetic effect for group I orbits, whereas for group II, it has a paramagnetic effect. It is also found that using a nonuniform guide ﬁeld, rather than a uniform one, causes the gain to increase.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Performance of the backward wave oscillator (BWO) is greatly enhanced with the introduction of plasma. Linear theory of the dispersion relation and the growth rate have been derived and analysed numerically for plasma-ﬁlled rippled wall rectangular waveguide driven by sheet electron beam. To see the effect of plasma on the TM$_{01}$ cold wave structure mode and on the generated frequency, the parameters used are: relativistic factor $\gamma = 1.5$ (i.e. $v/c = 0.741$), average waveguide height $y_0 = 1.445$ cm, axial corrugation period $z_0 = 1.67$ cm, and corrugation amplitude $\epsilon = 0.225$ cm. The plasma density is varied from zero to $2\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{−3}$. The presence of plasma tends to raise the TM$_{01}$ mode cut-off frequency (14 GH$_z$ at $2 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{−3}$ plasma density) relative to the vacuum cut-off frequency (5 GH$_z$) which also causes a decrease in the group velocity everywhere, resulting in a ﬂattening of the dispersion relation. With the introduction of plasma, an enhancement in absolute instability was observed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Three demonstration samples of intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) ﬁlms were deposited using hot wire–chemical vapour deposition (HW–CVD) technique. The optical parameters and the thickness were determined from the extremes of the interference fringes of transmission spectrum in the range of 400–2500 nm using the envelope method. The calculated values of the refractive index ($n$) were ﬁtted using the two-term Cauchy dispersion relation and the static refractive index values ($n_0$) obtained were 2.799, 2.629 and 3.043 which were in the range of the reported values. The calculated thicknesses for all samples were cross-checked with Taly-Step proﬁlometer and found to be almost equal. Detailed analysis was carried out to obtain the optical band gap ($E_g$) using Tauc’s method and the estimated values were 1.99, 2.01 and 1.75 eV. The optical band gap values were correlated with the hydrogen content ($C_H$) in the samples calculated from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. An attempt was made to apply Wemple–DiDomenico single-effective oscillator model to the a-Si:H samples to calculate the optical parameters. The optical band gap obtained by Tauc’s method and the static refractive index calculated from Cauchy ﬁtting are in good agreement with those obtained by the single-effective oscillator model. The real and the imaginary parts of dielectric constant ($\epsilon_r, \epsilon_i$), and the optical conductivity ($\sigma$) were  also calculated.</p>

				<title>A transformed rational function method for (3+1)-dimensional potential Yu–Toda–Sasa–Fukuyama equation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0561-0571</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A direct method, called the transformed rational function method, is used to construct more types of exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations by introducing new and more general rational functions. To illustrate the validity and advantages of the introduced general rational functions, the (3+1)-dimensional potential Yu–Toda–Sasa–Fukuyama (YTSF) equation is considered and new travelling wave solutions are obtained in a uniform way. Some of the obtained solutions, namely exponential function solutions, hyperbolic function solutions, trigonometric function solutions, Jacobi elliptic function solutions and rational solutions, contain an explicit linear function of the independent variables involved in the potential YTSF equation. It is shown that the transformed rational function method provides more powerful mathematical tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations.</p>

				<title>Investigation of $\Delta(3,3)$ resonance effects on the properties of neutron-rich double magic spherical ﬁnite nucleus, ${}^{132}$Sn, in the ground state and under compression</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0573-0589</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Within the framework of the radially constrained spherical Hartree–Fock (CSHF) approximation, the resonance effects of delta on the properties of neutron-rich double magic spherical nucleus ${}^{132}$Sn were studied. It was found that most of the increase in the nuclear energy generated under compression was used to create massive $\Delta$ particles. For ${}^{132}$Sn nucleus under compression at 3.19 times density of the normal nuclear density, the excited nucleons to $\Delta$s were increased sharply up to 16&#37; of the total number of constituents. This result is consistent with the values extracted from relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The single particle energy levels were calculated and their behaviours under compression were examined. A meaningful agreement was obtained between the results with effective Hamiltonian and that with the phenomenological shell model for the low-lying single-particle spectra. The results suggest considerable reduction in compressibility for the nucleus, and softening of the equation of state with the inclusion of $\Delta$s in the nuclear dynamics.</p>

					<p>We study the reﬂection of a Hermite–Gaussian beam at an interface between two dielectric media. We show that unlike Laguerre–Gaussian beams, Hermite–Gaussian beams undergo no signiﬁcant distortion upon reﬂection. We report Goos–Hänchen shift for all the spots of a higherorder Hermite–Gaussian beam near the critical angle. The shift is shown to be insigniﬁcant away from the critical angle. The calculations are carried out neglecting the longitudinal component along the direction of propagation for a spatially ﬁnite, s-polarized, full 3D vector beam. We brieﬂy discuss the difﬁculties associated with the paraxial approximation pertaining to a vector Gaussian beam.</p>

				<page>0613-0619</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ultrasonic properties of the hexagonal closed packed structured $Ni_3$Mo, $Ni_3$Nb and $Ni_3$Ta compounds were studied at room temperature for their characterization. For the investigations of ultrasonic properties, the second-order elastic constants using Lennard–Jones potential were computed. The velocities $V_1$ and $V_2$ have minima and maxima respectively at $45^{\circ}$ with the unique axis of the crystal, while $V_3$ increases with respect to angle with the unique axis of the crystal. The inconsistent behaviour of angle-dependent velocities is associated with the action of second-order elastic constants. Debye average sound velocities of these compounds increase with the angle and has maximum at $55^{\circ}$ with the unique axis at room temperature. Hence, when a sound wave travels at $55^{\circ}$ with the unique axis of these materials, the average sound velocity is found to be maximum. The results achieved are discussed and compared with the available experimental and theoretical results.</p>

				<page>0629-0637</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Meyer–Neldel (MN) formula for DC conductivity ($\sigma_{\text{DC}}$) of chalcogenide glasses is obtained using extended pair model and random free energy barriers. The integral equations for DC hopping conductivity and external conductance are solved by iterative procedure. It is found that MN energy ($\Delta E_{\text{MN}}$) originates from temperature-induced conﬁgurational and electronic disorders. Single polaron-correlated barrier hopping model is used to calculate $\sigma_{\text{DC}}$ and the experimental data of Se, As$_2$S$_3$, As$_2$Se$_3$ and As$_2$Te$_3$ are explained. The variation of attempt frequency $\upsilon_0$ and $\Delta E_{\text{MN}}$ with parameter $(r/a)$, where $r$ is the intersite separation and $a$ is the radius of localized states, is also studied. It is found that $\upsilon_0$ and $\Delta E_{\text{MN}}$ decrease with increase of $(r/a)$, and $\Delta E_{\text{MN}}$ may not be present for low density of defects.</p>

				<page>0657-0666</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The comparison of the inversion electron density between a nanometer metal-oxidesemiconductor (MOS) device with high-$K$ gate dielectric and a SiO$_2$ MOS device with the same equivalent oxide thickness has been discussed. A fully self-consistent solution of the coupled Schrödinger–Poisson equations demonstrates that a larger dielectric-constant mismatch between the gate dielectric and silicon substrate can reduce electron density in the channel of a MOS device under inversion bias. Such a reduction in inversion electron density of the channel will increase with increase in gate voltage. A reduction in the charge density implies a reduction in the inversion electron density in the channel of a MOS device. It also implies that a larger dielectric constant of the gate dielectric might result in a reduction in the source–drain current and the gate leakage current.</p>

				<title>A simpliﬁed approach for the generation of projection data for cone beam geometry</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0667-0679</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To test a developed reconstruction algorithm for cone beam geometry, whether it is transmission or emission tomography, one needs projection data. Generally, mathematical phantoms are generated in three dimensions and the projection for all rotation angles is calculated. For non-symmetric objects, the process is cumbersome and computation intensive. This paper describes a simple methodology for the generation of projection data for cone beam geometry for both transmission and emission tomographies by knowing the object’s attenuation and/or source spatial distribution details as input. The object details such as internal geometrical distribution are nowhere involved in the projection data calculation. This simple approach uses the pixilated object matrix values in terms of the matrix indices and spatial geometrical coordinates. The projection data of some typical phantoms (generated using this approach) are reconstructed using standard FDK algorithm and Novikov’s inversion formula. Correlation between the original and reconstructed images has been calculated to compare the image quality.</p>

					<p>Bianchi type-V string cosmological models in general relativity are investigated. To get the exact solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, we have taken some scale transformations used by Camci et al [Astrophys. Space Sci. {\bf 275}, 391 (2001)]. It is shown that Einstein’s ﬁeld equations are solvable for any arbitrary cosmic scale function. Solutions for particular forms of cosmic scale functions are also obtained. Some physical and geometrical aspects of the models are discussed.</p>

					<p>In this work, we present travelling wave solutions for the Burgers, Burgers–Huxley and modiﬁed Burgers–KdV equations. The ($G'/G$)-expansion method is used to determine travelling wave solutions of these sets of equations. The travelling wave solutions are expressed by the hyperbolic functions, the trigonometric functions and the rational functions. It is shown that the proposed method is direct, effective and can be used for many other nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics.</p>

				<title>On a new formulation of microphenomena: Basic principles, stationary ﬁelds and beyond</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0843-0873</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a series of essays, beginning with this article, we are going to develop a new formulation of microphenomena based on the principles of reality and causality. The new theory provides us with a new depiction of microphenomena assuming a uniﬁed concept of information, matter and energy. So, we suppose that in a deﬁnite microphysical context (including other interacting particles), each particle is enfolded by a probability ﬁeld whose existence is contingent on the existence of the particle, but it can locally affect the physical status of the particle in a context-dependent manner. The dynamics of the whole particle-ﬁeld system obeys deterministic equations in a manner such that when the particle is subjected to a conservative force, the ﬁeld also experiences a conservative complex force, the form of which is determined by the dynamics of the particle. So, the ﬁeld is endowed with a given amount of energy, but its value is contingent on the physical conditions the particle is subjected to. Based on the energy balance of the particle and its associated ﬁeld, we argue why the ﬁeld has a probabilistic objective nature. The basic elements of this new formulation, its application for some stationary states and its nonlinear generalization for conservative systems are discussed here.</p>

					<p>We present solutions of the Dirac equation with spin symmetry for vector and scalar modiﬁed Pöschl–Teller potentials within the framework of an approximation of the centrifugal term. The relativistic energy spectrum is obtained using the Nikiforov–Uvarov method and the two-component spinor wave functions obtained are in terms of the Jacobi polynomials.

				<title>Robust adaptive fuzzy neural tracking control for a class of unknown chaotic systems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0887-0900</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, an adaptive fuzzy neural controller (AFNC) for a class of unknown chaotic systems is proposed. The proposed AFNC is comprised of a fuzzy neural controller and a robust controller. The fuzzy neural controller including a fuzzy neural network identiﬁer (FNNI) is the principal controller. The FNNI is used for online estimation of the controlled system dynamics by tuning the parameters of fuzzy neural network (FNN). The Gaussian function, a speciﬁc example of radial basis function, is adopted here as a membership function. So, the tuning parameters include the weighting factors in the consequent part and the means and variances of the Gaussian membership functions in the antecedent part of fuzzy implications. To tune the parameters online, the back-propagation (BP) algorithm is developed. The robust controller is used to guarantee the stability and to control the performance of the closed-loop adaptive system, which is achieved always. Finally, simulation results show that the AFNC can achieve favourable tracking performances.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we have established the equation of state (EOS) for liquids. The EOS was established for hard-sphere (HS) ﬂuid along with Lennard–Jones (LJ) ﬂuid incorporating perturbation techniques. The calculations are based on suitable axiomatic functional forms for surface tension $S_m (r )$, $r \geq d/2$ with intermolecular separation $r$, as a variable, and $m$ is an arbitrary real number (pole). The results for $\beta P/ \rho$ from the present EOS thus obtained are compared with Percus-Yevick (PY), scaled particle theory (SPT), and Carnahan–Starling (CS). In addition, we have found a simple EOS for the HS ﬂuid in the region which represents the simulation data accurately.</p>
					<p>It is observed that, this EOS for HS gives, PY (pressure) for $m = 0$, CS for $m = 4/5$, whereas for $m = 1$ it corresponds to SPT.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We simulated the central reactions of nearly symmetric and asymmetric systems, for energies at which maximum production of intermediate mass fragments (IMF$_s$) occurred ($E^{\text{peak}}_{\text{c.m.}}$). This study was carried out using hard EOS along with Cugnon cross-section employing MSTB method for clusterization. We studied the various properties of fragments. The stability of fragments was checked through persistence coefﬁcient and gain term. The information about the thermalization and stopping in heavy-ion collisions was obtained via relative momentum, anisotropy ratio and rapidity distribution. We found that for a complete stopping of incoming nuclei very heavy systems are required. The mass dependence of various quantities (such as average and maximum central density, collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear matter) was also presented. In all cases (i.e., average and maximum central density, collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear matter) a power-law dependence was obtained.</p>				</abstract>

				<page>0933-0944</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Small amplitude quantum ion-acoustic solitary waves are studied in an unmagnetized twospecies relativistic quantum plasma system, comprised of electrons and ions. The one-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic model (QHD) is used to obtain a deformed Korteweg–de Vries (dKdV) equation by reductive perturbation method. A linear dispersion relation is also obtained taking into account the relativistic effect. The properties of quantum ion-acoustic solitary waves, obtained from the deformed KdV equation, are studied taking into account the quantum mechanical effects in the weak relativistic limit. It is found that relativistic effects signiﬁcantly modify the properties of quantum ion-acoustic waves. Also the effect of the quantum parameter $H$ on the nature of solitary wave solutions is studied in some detail.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear stability of pulsational mode of gravitational collapse in self-gravitating hydrostatically bounded dust molecular cloud</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0945-0956</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pulsational mode of gravitational collapse (PMGC) in a hydrostatically bounded dust molecular cloud is responsible for the evolution of tremendous amount of energy during star formation. The source of free energy for this gravito-electrostatic instability lies in the associated self-gravity of the dispersed phase of relatively huge dust grains of solid matter over the gaseous phase of background plasma. The nonlinear stability of the same PMGC in an inﬁnite dusty plasma model (plane geometry approximation for large wavelength ﬂuctuation in the absence of curvature effects) is studied in a hydrostatic kind of homogeneous equilibrium conﬁguration. By the standard reductive perturbation technique, a Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation for investigating the nonlinear evolution of the lowest order perturbed self-gravitational potential is developed in a time-stationary (steady-state) form, which is studied analytically as well as numerically. Different nonlinear structures (soliton-like and soliton chain-like) are found to exist in different situations. Astrophysical situations, relevant to it, are brieﬂy discussed.</p>

					<p>Good-quality hexagonal NbSe$_2$ single crystals were prepared. In 2H-NbSe$_2$, superconducting and charge density wave (CDW) transitions were found at $T_s = 7.4$ K and $T_c = 35$ K respectively as reported previously. We have noticed that these two transitions are changed to $T_c = 42$ K and $T_s = 6.5$ K, in 4H-NbSe$_2$. Thermopower has shown clear anomaly at CDW transitions. The anisotropic upper critical ﬁeld was calculated as $\sim 3$ and 6.3 for 2H- and 4H-single crystals around $t = 0.81$, where $t = T/T_s$, from resistivity and explained in terms of coherence length. From the relation, $H_{c2}(T) = H_{c2}(0)[1 − t^2]$, $H^l_{c2}(0)$ was calculated as $\sim 8.15$ T and 16.98 T at $t = 0.84$ in 2H-NbSe$_2$ and 4H-NbSe$_2$ respectively. However, $H^t_{c2}(0) = 2.68$ T for both single crystals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electronic properties of single-walled boron nitride nanotube in zig-zag form are numerically investigated by replacing B atoms with C atoms. Using a tight-binding Hamiltonian, the methods based on Green’s function theory, Landauer formalism and Dyson equation, the electronic density of states and electronic conductance in boron nitride nanotube and boron carbonitride nanotube are calculated. Our calculations indicate that in a boron nitride nanotube, the localized states associated with C impurities appear as the concentration of C atoms increases. The boron carbonitride nanotube thus behaves like a semiconductor. Also, by increasing the C atom concentration, the voltage in the ﬁrst step on the $I–V$ characteristics decreases, whereas the corresponding current increases.</p>

				<page>0973-0983</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc oxide nanothin ﬁlms were prepared on glass substrate by sol–gel dip-coating method using zinc acetate dihydrate, methanol, and monoethanolamine as precursor, solvent, and stabilizer, respectively. The relationship between drying conditions and the characteristics of ZnO nanocrystalline ﬁlms ($c$-axis orientation, grain size, roughness and optical properties) was studied. The ﬁlms were dried in an oven at different temperatures and by IR radiation. Then, the ﬁlms were annealed at $500^{\circ}$C in a furnace. The chemical composition, transmission spectra, structure, and morphology of the samples were studied using infrared (IR) and UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. The XRD results show that the drying conditions affect the orientation of crystallization along the (0 0 2) plane. AFM images show that the thicknesses of the ﬁlms decrease from 128 to 93 nm by changing the drying conditions. The photoluminescence (PL) of ZnO nanothin ﬁlms shows the UV emission at near band edge and broad green radiation at about 465 nm wavelength.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chandrasekhar’s monograph on \textit{Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability}, published in 1961, is a standard reference on linear stability theory. It gives a detailed account of stability of ﬂuid ﬂow in a variety of circumstances, including convection, stability of Couette ﬂow, Rayleigh–Taylor instability, Kelvin–Helmholtz instability as well as the Jean’s instability for star formation. In most cases he has extended these studies to include effects of rotation and magnetic ﬁeld. In a later paper he has given a variational formulation for equations of non-radial stellar oscillations. This forms the basis for helioseismic inversion techniques as well as extension to include the effect of rotation, magnetic ﬁeld and other large-scale ﬂows using a perturbation treatment.</p>

				<page>0019-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By 1939, when Chandrasekhar’s classic monograph on the theory of \textit{Stellar Structure} was published, although the need for recent star formation was fully acknowledged, no one had yet recognized an object that could be called a star in the process of being born. Young stellar objects (YSOs), as pre-main-sequence stars, were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s. Infrared excess emission and intrinsic polarization observed in these objects in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that they are surrounded by ﬂattened disks. The YSO disks were seen in direct imaging only in the 1980s. Since then, high-resolution optical imaging with HST, near-infrared adaptive optics on large groundbased telescopes, mm and radiowave interferometry have been used to image disks around a large number of YSOs revealing disk structure with ever-increasing detail and variety. The disks around YSOs are believed to be the sites of planet formation and a few such associations have now been conﬁrmed. The observed properties of the disk structure and their evolution, that have very important consequences for the theory of star and planet formation, are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The concept of limiting mass, introduced by Chandrasekhar in case of white dwarfs, plays an important role in the formation and stability of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes. Like white dwarfs, neutron stars have their own mass limit, and a compact conﬁguration would progress from one family to the next, more dense one once a mass limit is crossed. The mass limit of neutron stars depends on the nature of nuclear forces at very high density, which has so far not been determined conclusively. This article reviews how observational determinations of the properties of neutron stars are starting to impose signiﬁcant constraints on the state of matter at high density</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Our knowledge of the Galaxy is being revolutionized by a series of photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric surveys. Already an enormous body of data is available from completed surveys, and data of ever-increasing quality and richness will accrue at least until the end of this decade. To extract science from these surveys, we need a class of models that can give probability density functions in the space of the observables of a survey – we should not attempt to ‘invert’ the data from the space of observables into the physical space of the Galaxy. Currently just one class of model has the required capability, the so-called ‘torus models’. A pilot application of torus models to understand the structure of the Galaxy’s thin and thick discs has already produced two signiﬁcant results: a major revision of our best estimate of the Sun’s velocity with respect to the local standard of rest, and a successful prediction of the way in which the vertical velocity dispersion in the disc varies with distance from the Galactic plane.</p>

				<page>0053-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (Chandra) was just eight years old when the ﬁrst astrophysical jet was discovered in M87. Since then, jets have been uncovered with a wide variety of sources including accretion disks orbiting stellar and massive black holes, neutron stars, isolated pulsars, $\gamma$-ray bursts, protostars and planetary nebulae. This talk will be primarily concerned with collimated hydromagnetic outﬂows associated with spinning, massive black holes in active galactic nuclei. Jets exhibit physical processes central to three of the major research themes in Chandrasekhar’s research career – radiative transfer, magnetohydrodynamics and black holes. Relativistic jets can be thought of as `exhausts’ from both the hole and its orbiting accretion disk, carrying away the energy liberated by the rotating spacetime and the accreting gas that is not radiated. However, no aspect of jet formation, propagation and radiation can be regarded as understood in detail. The combination of new $\gamma$-ray, radio and optical observations together with impressive advances in numerical simulation make this a good time to settle some long-standing debates.</p>

Particular emphasis is placed on the Chandrasekhar–Kendall functions that allow a decomposition of a vector ﬁeld into right- and left-handed contributions. Magnetic energy spectra of both contributions are shown for a new set of helically forced simulations at resolutions higher than what has been available so far. For a forcing function with positive helicity, these simulations show a forward cascade of the right-handed contributions to the magnetic ﬁeld and nonlocal inverse transfer for the left-handed contributions. The speed of inverse transfer is shown to decrease with increasing value of the magnetic Reynolds number.</p>

				<title>Chandrasekhar’s book \textit{An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure}</title>

				<page>0097-0105</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For me, and for many astrophysicists of my generation, Chandrasekhar’s book \textit{An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure} was very important. I could not have done my PhD (1962–1965) without it. Much more recently (1998) I realized that I could not have written my lecture course on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics without much of it, particularly the ﬁrst chapter. I shall present anecdotal evidence that the inﬂuence of his discussion on the second law of thermodynamics has been important not just for astrophysics but for a much wider range of physics.</p>
					<p>Chandrasekhar’s discussion of polytropes was masterly. Even today polytropes play an important role as an aid for understanding stellar structure. I believe that to the list of analytic solutions of the polytrope only one more has to be added: a curious $n = 5$ model of Srivastava (1962).</p>
					<p>Stellar structure is nowadays a very computationally intensive subject. I shall illustrate this with a couple of topics from my experience with Djehuty, a supercomputer code for modelling stars in 3D. Nevertheless it remains true, I believe, that analytical mathematical entities like polytropes are fundamental as aids for understanding what the computers churn out.</p>
					<p>How close are we to seeing a book with the title `The Last Word on the Study of Stellar Structure’? Not very, although much has been learned in 70 years. I shall discuss a few of the aspects of stellar evolution that are problematic today.</p>
					<p>I shall discuss a couple of aspects where I believe analysis of `piecewise polytropic’ structures sheds light on the question `Why do stars become red giants?’</p>

The roles of chaos and integrability in this theory require clariﬁcation, especially for systems having a dominant central mass. After this prelude, a hypothetical form of bosonic dark matter with a simple but nontrivial statistical mechanics is discussed.

				<abstract>
					<p>Chandra’s academic life had several phases each culminating in a monograph describing that subject. I shall deal with aspects of his work in the two earliest phases. I shall describe the overall structure of statistical mechanics of gravitating systems, the relevance of isothermal sphere in the mean-ﬁeld approximation and issues related to collisional relaxation and dynamical friction in self-gravitating system of particles. There are several curious features in the history of these topics which I comment upon.</p>

				<title>Symmetry in stochasticity: Random walk models of large-scale structure</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0169-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the insights gained from the excursion set approach, in which various questions about the phenomenology of large-scale structure formation can be mapped to problems associated with the ﬁrst crossing distribution of appropriately deﬁned barriers by random walks. Much of this is summarized in R K Sheth, \textit{AIP Conf. Proc.} 1132, 158 (2009). So only a summary is given here, and instead a few new excursion set related ideas and results which are not published elsewhere are presented. One is a generalization of the formation time distribution to the case in which formation corresponds to the time when half the mass was ﬁrst assembled in pieces, each of which was at least $1/n$ times the ﬁnal mass, and where $n \geq 2$; another is an analysis of the ﬁrst crossing distribution of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. The ﬁrst derives from the mirror-image symmetry argument for random walks which Chandrasekhar described so elegantly in 1943; the second corrects a misuse of this argument. Finally, some discussion of the correlated steps and correlated walks assumptions associated with the excursion set approach, and the relation between these and peaks theory are also included. These are problems in which Chandra’s mirror-image symmetry is broken.</p>

				<title>Magnetohydrodynamics turbulence: An astronomical perspective</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0185-0198</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Early work on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the 1960s due, independently, to Iroshnikov and Kraichnan (IK) considered isotropic inertial-range spectra. Whereas laboratory experiments were not in a position to measure the spectral index, they showed that the turbulence was strongly anisotropic. Theoretical horizons correspondingly expanded in the 1980s, to accommodate both the isotropy of the IK theory and the anisotropy suggested by the experiments. Since the discovery of pulsars in 1967, many years of work on interstellar scintillation suggested that small-scale interstellar turbulence must have a hydromagnetic origin; but the IK spectrum was too ﬂat and the ideas on anisotropic spectra too qualitative to explain the observations. In response, new theories of balanced MHD turbulence were proposed in the 1990s, which argued that the IK theory was incorrect, and made quantitative predictions of anisotropic inertial-range spectra; these theories have since found applications in many areas of astrophysics. Spacecraft measurements of solar-wind turbulence show that there is more power in Alfvén waves that travel away from the Sun than towards it. Theories of imbalanced MHD turbulence have now been proposed to address interplanetary turbulence. This very active area of research continues to be driven by astronomy.</p>

				<title>The origin of the strongest magnetic ﬁelds in dwarfs</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0199-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>White dwarfs have frozen in magnetic ﬁelds ranging from below the measurable limit of about $3 \times 10^3$ to $10^9$ G. White dwarfs with surface magnetic ﬁelds in excess of 1 MG are found as isolated single stars and relatively more often in magnetic cataclysmic variables. Some 1253 white dwarfs with a detached low-mass main-sequence companion have been identiﬁed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) but none of these shows sufﬁcient evidence for Zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines for a magnetic ﬁeld in excess of 1 MG. If such high magnetic ﬁelds in white dwarfs result from the isolated evolution of a single star then there should be the same fraction of high ﬁeld white dwarfs among this SDSS binary sample as among single stars. Thus, we deduce that the origin of such high magnetic ﬁelds must be intimately tied to the formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs). The formation of a CV must involve orbital shrinkage from giant star to main-sequence star dimensions. It is believed that this shrinkage occurs as the low-mass companion and the white dwarf spiral together inside a common envelope. CVs emerge as very close but detached binary stars that are then brought together by magnetic braking or gravitational radiation. We propose that the smaller the orbital separation at the end of the common envelope phase, the stronger the magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic cataclysmic variables (MCVs) originate from those common envelope systems that almost merge. Those common envelope systems that do merge are the progenitors of the single high ﬁeld white dwarfs. Thus all highly magnetic white dwarfs, be they single stars or the components of MCVs, have a binary origin. This accounts for the relative dearth of single white dwarfs with ﬁelds of $10^4$ – $10^6$ G. Such intermediate-ﬁeld white dwarfs are found preferentially in cataclysmic variables. The bias towards higher masses for highly magnetic white dwarfs is expected if a fraction of these form when two degenerate cores merge in a common envelope. From the space density of single highly magnetic white dwarfs we estimate that about three times as many common envelope events lead to a merged core as to a cataclysmic variable.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we establish exact solutions for some special nonlinear partial differential equations. The ($G'/G$)-expansion method is used to construct travelling wave solutions of the twodimensional sine-Gordon equation, Dodd–Bullough–Mikhailov and Schrödinger–KdV equations, which appear in many ﬁelds such as, solid-state physics, nonlinear optics, ﬂuid dynamics, ﬂuid ﬂow, quantum ﬁeld theory, electromagnetic waves and so on. In this method we take the advantage of general solutions of second-order linear ordinary differential equation (LODE) to solve many nonlinear evolution equations effectively. The ($G'/G$)-expansion method is direct, concise and elementary and can be used with a wider applicability for handling many nonlinear wave equations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work, the excited states of ${}^{113}$Sb were populated in the ${}^{100}$Mo(${}^{20}$Ne, $p6n$) reaction at a beam energy of 136 MeV. States only up to $59/2^−$ were observed in the $\Delta J = 2$ band. Mean lifetimes for the ﬁve states (from 4460 to 7998 keV) were measured for the ﬁrst time using Doppler shift attenuation method. An upper limit of the lifetime (0.14 ps) was estimated for the 9061 keV, $47/2^−$ state. The $B(E2)$ values, derived from the present lifetime results, correspond to a large quadrupole deformation of $\beta_2 = 0.32$. The observed reduction in the experimental $B(E2)$ values for the 918.4 keV (spin $39/2^− \to 35/2^−$) and 985 keV (spin $43/2^−  \to 39/2^−$) transitions may be interpreted as due to the proton alignement in the $g_{7/2}$ orbital. The dynamic moment of inertia was observed to be about half of the rigid body value at the highest observed frequency.</p>

					<p>We studied the transverse ﬂow throughout the mass range from ${}^{20} \text{Ne}+{}^{20}\text{Ne}$ to ${}^{131}$Xe+${}^{131}$Xe as a function of the impact parameter. We found that at smaller impact parameters the ﬂow is negative while going through the impact parameter, transverse ﬂow vanishes at a particular colliding geometry named GVF. We found that the mass dependence of GVF is insensitive to the equation of state and momentum-dependent interactions whereas it is quite sensitive to the cross-section. So it can act as a useful tool to pin down the nucleon–nucleon cross-section.</p>

				<title>Rapidity dependence of multiplicity ﬂuctuations and correlations in high-energy nucleus–nucleus interactions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0297-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The multiplicity ﬂuctuations of the produced pions were studied using scaled variance method in ${}^{16}$O–AgBr interactions at 2.1 AGeV, ${}^{24}$Mg–AgBr interactions at 4.5 AGeV, ${}^{12}$C–AgBr interactions at 4.5 AGeV, ${}^{16}$O–AgBr interactions at 60 AGeV and ${}^{32}$S–AgBr interactions at 200 AGeV at two different binning conditions. In the ﬁrst binning condition, the rapidity interval was varied in steps of one centring about the central rapidity until it reached 14. In the second case, the rapidity interval was increased in steps of 1.6 up to 14.4. Multiplicity distributions and their scaled variances were presented as a function of the dependence on the rapidity width for both the binning conditions. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations were found to increase with the increase of rapidity interval and later found to saturate at larger rapidity window for all the interactions and in both the binning conditions. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations were found to increase with the energy of the projectile beam. The values of the scaled variances were found to be greater than one in all the cases in both the binning conditions indicating the presence of correlation during the multiparticle production process in high-energy nucleus–nucleus interactions. Experimental results were compared with the results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulated events for all the interactions. The Monte Carlo simulated data showed very small values of scaled variance suggesting very small ﬂuctuations for the simulated events. Experimental results obtained from ${}^{16}O–AgBr interactions at 60 AGeV and ${}^{32}S–AgBr interactions at 200 AGeV were compared with the events generated by Lund Monte Carlo code (FRITIOF model). FRITIOF model failed to explain the multiplicity ﬂuctuations of pions emitted from ${}^{16}$O–AgBr interactions at 60 AGeV for both the binning conditions. However, the experimental data agreed well with the FRITIOF model for ${}^{32}$S–AgBr interactions at 200 AGeV.</p>

				<title>Improved analysis on multiple recycling of fuel in prototype fast breeder reactor in a closed fuel cycle</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0315-0333</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An FBR closed fuel cycle involves recycling of the discharge fuel, after reprocessing and refabrication, to utilize the unburnt fuel remains and the freshly bred ﬁssile material. Our previous study in this regard for the PFBR indicated a comfortable feasibility of multiple recycling with selfsufﬁciency. In the present work, more reﬁned estimations are done using the most recent nuclear data, viz. ENDF/B-VII.0, and with the most recent speciﬁcation of the fuel composition. Among others, this paper brings out the importance of taking into account the energy self-shielding effects in the cross-section averages used in the study. While self-shielded averages lead to realistic predictions, unshielded averages signiﬁcantly overpredict breeding in the blankets and underpredict loss in the cores.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we report a new method to determine the effective atomic number, $Z_{\text{eff}}$, of composite materials for Compton effect in the γ -ray region 280–1115 keV based on the theoretically obtained Klein–Nishina scattering cross-sections in the angular range $50^{\circ}–100^{\circ}$ as well as a method to experimentally measure differential incoherent (Compton) scattering cross-sections in this angular range. The method was employed to evaluate $Z_{\text{eff}}$ for different inorganic compounds containing elements in the range $Z = 1–56$, at three scattering angles $60^{\circ}$, $80^{\circ}$ and $100^{\circ}$ at three incident gamma energies 279.1 keV, 661.6 keV and 1115.5 keV and we have veriﬁed this method to be an appropriate method. Interestingly, the $Z_{\text{eff}}$ values so obtained for the inorganic compounds were found to be equal to the total number of electrons present in the sample as given by the atomic number of the elements constituting the sample in accordance with the chemical formula of the sample. This was the case at all the three energies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Magnetic ﬁeld-induced dispersion of ultrasonic velocity in a Mn$_{0.7}$Zn$_{0.3}$Fe$_{2}$O$_4$ ﬂuid (applied magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the ultrasonic propagation vector) is determined by employing continuous wave method. The magnitude of dispersion initially decreases with increasing ﬁeld, then increases and reaches a plateau at higher ﬁelds. Results indicate that the velocity anisotropy is dominated by grain–grain interactions rather than grain–ﬁeld interaction. At the critical temperature, the grain–grain interaction becomes weak as the transverse component of the particle/cluster moment is larger than the longitudinal one and the system reaches saturation even at low ﬁeld. These observed variations in the ﬁeld-induced anisotropy are analysed by incorporating the moment distribution of particles in Tarapov’s theory (\textit{J. Magn. Magn. Mater.} 39, 51 (1983)).</p>

The lattice mismatch effect in ZB CrTe and magnetic properties of CrTe in the ideal ZB CrTe structure were investigated. The band alignment properties of the ZnTe/CrTe(0 0 1), CdTe/CrTe(0 0 1) and CdSe/CrTe(0 0 1) interfaces were computed and a rather large minority valence band offset of about 1.09 eV was observed in ZnTe/CrTe(0 0 1) heterojunction. Also in the CdTe/CrTe(0 0 1) and CdSe/CrTe(0 0 1) interfaces, the conduction band minimum of minority spin in CrTe was above the conduction band minimum of CdTe and CdSe and so the majority spin electrons could be directly injected to both semiconductors, indicating the possibility of highly efﬁcient spin injection into the CdSe and CdTe semiconductors.</p>

				<page>0415-0428</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent interest in higher-dimensional cosmological models has prompted some signiﬁ-cant work on the mathematical technicalities of how one goes about embedding spacetimes into some higher-dimensional space. We survey results in the literature (existence theorems and simple explicit embeddings); brieﬂy outline our work on global embeddings as well as explicit results for more complex geometries; and provide some examples. These results are contextualized physically, so as to provide a foundation for a detailed commentary on several key issues in the ﬁeld such as: the meaning of `Ricci equivalent’ embeddings; the uniqueness of local (or global) embeddings; symmetry inheritance properties; and astrophysical constraints.</p>

				<title>On the enigmatic $\Lambda$ – A true constant of spacetime</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0433-0437</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Had Einstein followed the Bianchi differential identity for the derivation of his equation of motion for gravitation, $\Lambda$ would have emerged as a true new constant of spacetime on the same footing as the velocity of light? It is then conceivable that he could have perhaps made the most profound prediction that the Universe may suffer accelerated expansion some time in the future! Further we argue that its identiﬁcation with the quantum vacuum energy is not valid as it should have to be accounted for like the gravitational ﬁeld energy by enlarging the basic framework of spacetime and not through a stress tensor. The acceleration of the expansion of the Universe may indeed be measuring its value for the ﬁrst time observationally.</p>

					<p>We obtain a class of solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell equations describing charged static spheres. Upon specifying particular forms for one of the gravitational potentials and the electric ﬁeld intensity, the condition for pressure isotropy is transformed into a hypergeometric equation with two free parameters. For particular parameter values we recover uncharged solutions corresponding to speciﬁc neutron star models.

				<title>A note on the Lie symmetries of complex partial differential equations and their split real systems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0483-0491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Folklore suggests that the split Lie-like operators of a complex partial differential equation are symmetries of the split system of real partial differential equations. However, this is not the case generally. We illustrate this by using the complex heat equation, wave equation with dissipation, the nonlinear Burgers equation and nonlinear KdV equations. We split the Lie symmetries of a complex partial differential equation in the real domain and obtain real Lie-like operators. Further, the complex partial differential equation is split into two coupled or uncoupled real partial differential equations which constitute a system of two equations for two real functions of two real variables. The Lie symmetries of this system are constructed by the classical Lie approach. We compare these Lie symmetries with the split Lie-like operators of the given complex partial differential equation for the examples considered. We conclude that the split Lie-like operators of complex partial differential equations are not in general symmetries of the split system of real partial differential equations. We prove a proposition that gives the criteria when the Lie-like operators are symmetries of the split system.</p>

				<page>0493-0507</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A singular perturbation solution is given for small Reynolds number ﬂow past a spherical liquid drop. The interfacial tension required to maintain the drop in a spherical shape is calculated. When the interfacial tension gradient exceeds a critical value, a region of reversed ﬂow occurs on the interface at the rear and the interior ﬂow splits into two parts with reversed circulation at the rear. The magnitude of the interior ﬂuid velocity is small, of order the Reynolds number. A thin transition layer attached to the drop at the rear occurs in the exterior ﬂow. The effects could model the stagnant cap which forms as surfactant is added but the results apply however the variability in the interfacial tension might have been induced.</p>

				<title>An investigation of embeddings for spherically symmetric spacetimes into Einstein manifolds</title>

				<page>0533-0543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Embeddings into higher dimensions are very important in the study of higherdimensional theories of our Universe and in high-energy physics. Theorems which have been developed recently guarantee the existence of embeddings of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds into Einstein spaces and more general pseudo-Riemannian spaces. These results provide a technique that can be used to determine solutions for such embeddings. Here we consider local isometric embeddings of four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes into ﬁve-dimensional Einstein manifolds. Difﬁculties in solving the ﬁve-dimensional equations for given four-dimensional spaces motivate us to investigate embedded spaces that admit bulks of a speciﬁc type. We show that the general Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetime and Einstein Universe are the only spherically symmetric spacetimes that can be embedded into an Einstein space of a particular form, and we discuss their ﬁve-dimensional solutions.</p>

In particular, a range of consequences on the form of the wave equation, the symmetries and number of conservation laws, inter alia, are altered by the manifold on which the model wave rests. We ﬁnd Lie and Noether point symmetries of the corresponding wave equations and give some reductions. Some interesting physical conclusions relating to conservation laws such as energy, linear and angular momenta are also determined.

				<title>Estimate of stellar masses from their QPO frequencies</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0571-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kilohertz quasiperiodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) are observed in binary stellar systems. For such a system, the stellar radius is very close to the marginally stable orbit $R_{\text{ms}}$ as predicted by Einstein’s general relativity. Many models have been proposed to explain the origin of the kHz QPO features in the binaries. Here we start from the work of Li et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 83}, 3776 (1999)) who in 1999, from the unique millisecond X-ray pulsations, suggested SAX J1808.4−3658 to be a strange star, from an accurate determination of its rotation period. It showed kHz QPOs eight years ago and so far it is the only set that has been observed. We suggest that the mass of four compact stars SAX J1808.4−3658, KS 1731−260, SAX J1750.8−2900 and IGR J17191−2821 can be determined from the difference in the observed kHz QPOs of these stars. It is exciting to be able to give an estimate of the mass of the star and three other compact stars in low-mass X-ray binaries using their observed kHz QPOs.</p>

					<p>In this paper we provide invariant linearizability criteria for a class of systems of four second-order ordinary differential equations in terms of a set of 30 constraint equations on the coefﬁcients of all derivative terms. The linearization criteria are derived by the analytic continuation of the geometric approach of projection of two-dimensional systems of cubically semi-linear secondorder differential equations. Furthermore, the canonical form of such systems is also established. Numerous examples are presented that show how to linearize nonlinear systems to the free particle Newtonian systems with a maximally symmetric Lie algebra relative to $sl$(6, $\mathfrak{R}$) of dimension 35.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with surface proﬁlometry, where we try to detect a periodic structure, hidden in randomness using the matched ﬁlter method of analysing the intensity of light, scattered from the surface. From the direct problem of light scattering from a composite rough surface of the above type, we ﬁnd that the detectability of the periodic structure can be hindered by the randomness, being dependent on the correlation function of the random part. In our earlier works, we had concentrated mainly on the Cauchy-type correlation function for the rough part. In the present work, we show that this technique can determine the periodic structure of different kinds of correlation functions of the roughness, including Cauchy, Gaussian etc. We study the detection by the matched ﬁlter method as the nature of the correlation function is varied.</p>

The present investigation deals with a technique to design and study the characteristics of an achromatic combination of birefringent plates in 800–2000 nm range. The retarder has been designed using calcite, crystalline quartz and ADP. The thicknesses of the plates are 19.38 $\mu$m, 446.14 $\mu$m and 12.57 $\mu$m respectively. The new arrangement of three birefringent plates proposed has the promise of producing a zero-order quarter wave achromatic combination with fairly good accuracy.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0633-0653</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A three-level atom in a $\Lambda$ conﬁguration trapped in an optical cavity forms a basic unit in a number of proposed protocols for quantum information processing. This system allows for efﬁcient storage of cavity photons into long-lived atomic excitations, and their retrieval with high ﬁdelity, in an adiabatic transfer process through the ‘dark state’ by a slow variation of the control laser intensity. We study the full quantum mechanics of this transfer process with a view to examine the non-adiabatic effects arising from inevitable excitations of the system to states involving the upper level of $\Lambda$, which is radiative. We ﬁnd that the ﬁdelity of storage is better, the stronger the control ﬁeld and the slower the rate of its switching off. On the contrary, unlike the adiabatic notion, retrieval is better with faster rates of switching on of an optimal control ﬁeld. Also, for retrieval, the behaviour with dissipation is non-monotonic. These results lend themselves to experimental tests. Our exact computations, when applied to slow variations of the control intensity for strong atom–photon couplings, are in very good agreement with Berry’s superadiabatic transfer results without dissipation.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0655-0667</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An accurate numerical model to investigate the pump-to-signal relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer in two-pump ﬁbre optical parametric ampliﬁers (2-P FOPAs) for low modulation frequencies is presented. Compared to other models in the ﬁeld, this model takes into account the ﬁbre loss, pump depletion as well as the gain saturation. As a result, the model allows to include a wide range of practical circumstances, both in and beyond the undepleted pump regime, related to different applications of FOPAs. In the small-signal or undepleted pump regime, the model predicts the ripples of the RIN spectrum very well and yields better results than those of other models. It is shown that beyond the small-signal regime, pump power variations do not remain unchanged over the length of the ampliﬁer and for high signal powers, when the FOPA saturates, minimum pump-to-signal RIN transfer occurs. The results of the model are also compared with the available experimental data in the ﬁeld and a very good agreement can be seen.</p>

					<p>Dielectric barrier discharge type of plasma reactor was used for the low-temperature plasma (LTP) treatment of the wool fabrics. Air was used as the non-polymerizing gas for the plasma treatment at different time intervals. Low-stress mechanical properties of the treated and untreated wool fabrics were evaluated using Siro-fast technique which revealed that the tensile, bending, compression, shear, dimensional stability and surface properties were altered after the LTP treatment. Other properties such as thermal conductivity, thermal resistance and pilling propensity were also evaluated. The surface topographical changes of the wool ﬁbres after LTP treatment were analysed by scanning electron microscopy. The changes in these properties are supposed to be related closely to the interﬁbre and interyarn frictional force and increased surface area of the ﬁbres induced by the etching effect of plasma.</p>

The static properties of the mixed ionic crystal NH$_4$Cl$_{1−x}$ Br$_x$ have been recently investigated, using the three-body potential model (TDPM) by applying Vegard’s law. Here, by using a simple theoretical model, we estimate the bulk modulus of the alloys NH$_4$Cl$_{1−x} Br$_x$ , in terms of the bulk modulus of the end members alone. The calculated values are comparable to those deduced from the three-body potential model (TDPM) by applying Vegard’s law.</p>

					<p>The position and momentum space information entropies of weakly interacting trapped atomic Bose–Einstein condensates and spin-polarized trapped atomic Fermi gases at absolute zero temperature are evaluated. We ﬁnd that sum of the position and momentum space information entropies of these quantum systems containing $N$ atoms conﬁned in a $D(\leq 3)$-dimensional harmonic trap has a universal form as $S^{(D)}_t = N(a D − b ln N)$, where $a \sim 2.332$ and $b = 2$ for interacting bosonic systems and a $a \sim 1.982$ and $b = 1$ for ideal fermionic systems. These results obey the entropic uncertainty relation given by Beckner, Bialynicki-Birula and Myceilski.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the effects of swift heavy ion beam irradiation on the structural, chemical and optical properties of Makrofol solid-state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) were investigated. Makrofol-KG ﬁlms of 40 $\mu$m thickness were irradiated with oxygen beam ($O^{8+}$) with ﬂuences ranging between $10^{10}$ ion/cm$^{2}$ and $10^{12}$ ion/cm$^2$. Structural, chemical and optical properties were investigated using X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy and UV–visible spectroscopy methods. It is observed that the direct and indirect band gaps of Makrofol-KG decrease after the irradiation. The XRD study shows that the crystalline size in the ﬁlms decreases at higher ﬂuences. The intensity plots of FTIR measurements indicate the degradation of Makrofol at higher ﬂuences. Roughness of the surface increases at higher ﬂuence.</p>

					<p>The effect of hybridization of conduction electrons and f-level on superconductivity (SC) and antiferromagnetism (AFM) in the coexistent phase of rare-earth nickel borocarbide superconductors ($R$Ni$_2$B$_2$C) is reported. The Hamiltonian of the system is a mean ﬁeld one and has been solved by writing equations of motion for the single-particle Green functions. It is assumed that superconductivity arises due to BCS pairing mechanism in the presence of antiferromagnetism in nickel lattices of Ni$_2$B$_2$ plane. The expressions for superconducting and antiferromagnetic order parameters are derived using double time electron Green functions. The quasiparticle energy bands are plotted and the nature of band dispersion of the quasiparticles is studied.</p>

					<p>This study examined the electrical and optical properties of red OLEDs (organic lightemitting diodes) with a four-layer structure, ITO/amorphous fluoropolymer (AF)/$N,N'$--diphenyl$N,N'$-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1, 1-biphenyl-4,$4'$-diamine (TPD)/R-H:R-D/lithium fluoride (LiF)/Al, containing a hole injection material, AF (amorphous fluoropolymer) and an electron injection material, LiF. Compared to the basic structure (two-layer structure), the brightness and luminous efficiency of the four-layer structure, ITO/TPD/R-H:R-D/Al, increased approximately 100 times (30,000 lm/m$^2$) and 150 times (51 lm/W), respectively, with an applied voltage. The excellent efficiency of the external proton was also increased 150 times (0.51&#37;). That is, the hole and electron injection layers improved the surface roughness of ITO and Al, and the interfacial physical properties. In addition, these layers allowed the smooth injection of holes and electrons. The luminance, luminous efficiency and external quantum efficiency were attributed to an increase in the recombination rates.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Elemental mixtures of Al, Cu, Fe powders with the nominal composition of Al$_{70}$Cu$_{20}$Fe$_{10}$ were mechanically alloyed in a planetary ball mill for 80 h. Subsequent annealing of the as-milled powders were performed at 600–800$^{\circ}$C temperature range for 4 h. Structural characteristics of the mechanically alloyed $Al$_{70}Cu$_{20}$Fe$_{10}$ powders with the milling time and the heat treatment were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Mechanical alloying of the Al$_{70}$Cu$_{20}$Fe$_{10}$ did not result in the formation of icosahedral quasicrystalline phase (i-phase) and a long time milling resulted in the formation of $\beta$-Al(Cu,Fe) solid solution phase ($\beta$-phase). The i-phase was observed only for short-time milled powders after heat treatment above $600^{\circ}$C. The $\beta$-phase was one of the major phases in the Al$_{70}$Cu$_{20}$Fe$_{10}$ alloy. The w-Al$_7$Cu$_2$Fe$_1$ phase (w-phase) was obtained only after heat treatment of the short-time milled and unmilled samples. The present investigation indicated that a suitable technique to obtain a large amount of quasicrystalline powders is to use a combination of short-time milling and subsequent annealing.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Inhalation of radon has been recognized as a health hazard. In the present work radon concentration was measured, in the atmosphere of the archaeological place, namely Catacomb of Kom El-Shuqafa, in Alexandria, Egypt, which is open to the public, using time-integrated passiveradon dosimeters containing LR-115 solid-state nuclear track detector. The measurements were performed throughout winter and summer. Seasonal variation of radon concentration, with the maximum in summer ranging from 243 to 574 Bq m$^{−3}$ and minimum in winter ranging from 64 to 255 Bq m$^{−3}$ was observed. Because of the variations of the catacomb ventilation system, the equilibrium factor between radon and its progeny ranges from 0.14 to 0.48. The tour guides are exposed to an average estimated annual effective dose ranging from 0.21 to 0.52 mSv y$^{−1}$ and the visitors from 0.88 to 2.28 $\mu$Sv y$^{−1}$. The effective doses the catacomb workers are exposed to ranged from 0.20 mSv y$^{−1}$ in winter to 4.65 mSv y$^{−1}$ in summer which exceeds the lower bound of the recommended level (3–10 mSv y$^{−1}$) (ICRP, 1993).</p>

				<title>Kondo effect and mesoscopic ﬂuctuations</title>
				<feature>Quantum Chaos</feature>
				<page>0769-0779</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two important themes in nanoscale physics in the last two decades are correlations between electrons and mesoscopic ﬂuctuations. Here we review our recent work on the intersection of these two themes. The setting is the Kondo effect, a paradigmatic example of correlated electron physics, in a nanoscale system with mesoscopic ﬂuctuations; in particular, we consider a small quantum dot coupled to a ﬁnite reservoir (which itself may be a large quantum dot). We discuss three aspects of this problem. First, in the high-temperature regime, we argue that a Kondo temperature $T_K$ which takes into account the mesoscopic ﬂuctuations is a relevant concept: for instance, physical properties are universal functions of $T/T_K$. Secondly, when the temperature is much less than the mean level spacing due to conﬁnement, we characterize a natural cross-over from weak to strong coupling. This strong coupling regime is itself characterized by well-deﬁned single-particle levels, as one can see from a Nozières Fermi-liquid theory argument. Finally, using a mean-ﬁeld technique, we connect the mesoscopic ﬂuctuations of the quasiparticles in the weak coupling regime to those at strong coupling.</p>

				<title>Classically induced suppression of energy growth in a chaotic quantum system</title>
				<feature>Quantum Chaos</feature>
				<page>0793-0802</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent experiments with Bose–Einstein condensates (BEC) in traps and speckle potentials have explored the dynamical regime in which the evolving BEC clouds localize due to the inﬂuence of classical dynamics. The growth of their mean energy is effectively arrested. This is in contrast with the well-known localization phenomena that originate due to quantum interferences. We show that classically induced localization can also be obtained in a classically chaotic, non-interacting system. In this work, we study the classical and quantum dynamics of non-interacting particles in a double-barrier structure. This is essentially a non-KAM system and, depending on the parameters, can display chaotic dynamics inside the ﬁnite well between the barriers. However, for the same set of parameters, it can display nearly regular dynamics above the barriers. We exploit this combination of two qualitatively different classical dynamical features to obtain saturation of energy growth. In the semiclassical regime, this classical mechanism strongly inﬂuences the quantum behaviour of the system.</p>

					<p>We study the effect of learning dynamics on network topology. Firstly, a network of discrete dynamical systems is considered for this purpose and the coupling strengths are made to evolve according to a temporal learning rule that is based on the paradigm of spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP). This incorporates necessary competition between different edges. The ﬁnal network we obtain is robust and has a broad degree distribution. Then we study the dynamics of the structure of a formal neural network. For properly chosen input signals, there exists a steady state with a residual network. We compare the motif proﬁle of such a network with that of the real neural network of $C$. elegans and identify robust qualitative similarities. In particular, our extensive numerical simulations show that this STDP-driven resulting network is robust under variations of model parameters.</p>

				<title>Multiple dynamical time-scales in networks with hierarchically nested modular organization</title>
				<feature>Biological Systems</feature>
				<page>0833-0842</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many natural and engineered complex networks have intricate mesoscopic organization, e.g., the clustering of the constituent nodes into several communities or modules. Often, such modularity is manifested at several different hierarchical levels, where the clusters deﬁned at one level appear as elementary entities at the next higher level. Using a simple model of a hierarchical modular network, we show that such a topological structure gives rise to characteristic time-scale separation between dynamics occurring at different levels of the hierarchy. This generalizes our earlier result for simple modular networks, where fast intramodular and slow intermodular processes were clearly distinguished. Investigating the process of synchronization of oscillators in a hierarchical modular network, we show the existence of as many distinct time-scales as there are hierarchical levels in the system. This suggests a possible functional role of such mesoscopic organization principle in natural systems, viz., in the dynamical separation of events occurring at different spatial scales.</p>

We show that the global dynamics of this model multicellular system depends on the system size, coupling strength and the intrinsic dynamics of the cells. The intrinsic variability in dynamics of the constituent cells are suppressed to stable dynamics, or modiﬁed to intermittency under different conditions. This simple model study reveals that cell–cell communication, system size and intrinsic cellular dynamics can lead to evolution of collective dynamics in structured multicellular biological systems that is signiﬁcantly different from its constituent single-cell behaviour.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper investigates synchronization in unidirectionally coupled dynamical systems wherein the inﬂuence of drive on response is cumulative: coupling signals are integrated over a time interval $\tau$. A major consequence of integrative coupling is that the onset of the generalized and phase synchronization occurs at higher coupling compared to the instantaneous $(\tau = 0)$ case. The critical coupling strength at which synchronization sets in is found to increase with $\tau$. The systems explored are the chaotic Rössler and limit cycle (the Landau–Stuart model) oscillators. For coupled Rössler oscillators the region of generalized synchrony in the phase space is intercepted by an asynchronous region which corresponds to anomalous generalized synchronization.</p>

The avalanche time distributions of the V-lattice, a unique realization of the networks, show power-law behaviour when tested with certain fractions of its trunk weights. All other avalanche distributions show Gaussian peaked behaviour. Thus the V-lattice is the critical case of the network. We discuss the implications of this result.</p>

				<title>Delay or anticipatory synchronization in one-way coupled systems using variable delay with reset</title>
				<feature>Synchronization, Coupled Systems and Networks</feature>
				<page>0891-0904</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a mechanism for the synchronization of one-way coupled nonlinear systems in which the coupling uses a variable delay, that is reset at ﬁnite intervals. Here the delay varies in the same way as the system in time and so the coupling function remains constant for the reset interval at the end of which it is reset to the value at that time. This leads to a novel and discrete error dynamics and the resulting general stability analysis is applicable to chaotic or hyperchaotic systems. We apply this method to standard chaotic systems and hyperchaotic time delay systems. The results of the detailed numerical analysis agree with the results from stability analysis in both cases. This method has the advantage that it is cost-effective since information from the driving system is needed only at intervals of reset. Further, in the context of time delay systems, optimization among the different time-scales depending upon the application is possible due to the ﬂexibility among the four different time-scales in our method, viz. delay in the driving system, anticipation in the response system, system delay time and reset time. We suggest a bi-channel scheme for implementing this method in communication ﬁeld with enhanced security</p>

					<p>We investigate phase-locked solutions of a continuum ﬁeld of nonlocally coupled identical phase oscillators with distance-dependent propagation delays. Equilibrium relations for both synchronous and travelling wave solutions in the parameter space characterizing the nonlocality and time delay are delineated. For the synchronous states a comprehensive stability diagram is presented that provides a heuristic synchronization condition as well as an analytic relation for the marginal stability curve. The relation yields simple stability expressions in the limiting cases of local and global coupling of phase oscillators.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We employ Jacobi’s last multiplier (JLM) to study planar differential systems. In particular, we examine its role in the transformation of the temporal variable for a system of ODEs originally analysed by Calogero–Leyvraz in course of their identiﬁcation of isochronous systems. We also show that JLM simpliﬁes to a great extent the proofs of isochronicity for the Liénard-type equations.</p>

				<feature>Nonlinear Waves and Solitons</feature>
				<page>0929-0947</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Gross–Pitaevskii equation (GPE) describing the evolution of the Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) order parameter for weakly interacting bosons supports dark solitons for repulsive interactions and bright solitons for attractive interactions. After a brief introduction to BEC and a general review of GPE solitons, we present our results on solitons that arise in the BEC of hard-core bosons, which is a system with strongly repulsive interactions. For a given background density, this system is found to support both a dark soliton and an antidark soliton (i.e., a bright soliton on a pedestal) for the density proﬁle. When the background has more (less) holes than particles, the dark (antidark) soliton solution dies down as its velocity approaches the sound velocity of the system, while the antidark (dark) soliton persists all the way up to the sound velocity. This persistence is in contrast to the behaviour of the GPE dark soliton, which dies down at the Bogoliubov sound velocity. The energy–momentum dispersion relation for the solitons is shown to be similar to the exact quantum low-lying excitation spectrum found by Lieb for bosons with a delta-function interaction.</p>

					<p>A brief review of a recent work on a novel collisionless scheme for stopping electron current pulse in plasma is presented. This scheme relies on the inhomogeneity of the plasma medium. This mechanism can be used for heating an overdense regime of plasma where lasers cannot penetrate. The method can ensure efﬁcient localized heating at a desired location.

					<p>We aim to study the nonlinear optical phenomena with ultra-broadband radiation in photonic crystal ﬁbre (PCF). While PCFs with cores made from different glasses are well studied in previous works, in this paper, it is planned to investigate the dynamics of nonlinear processes of supercontinuum generation (SCG) in liquid-ﬁlled PCF (LCPCF) to understand the physical phenomena of femtosecond pulse propagation, particularly, the temporal and spectral changes of the pulse propagating through speciﬁc PCFs. Since the CS$_2$-ﬁlled LCPCF has complex nonlinear phenomena, we intend to analyse the role of saturable nonlinear response and slow nonlinear response on SCG in detail. For the physical explanation, soliton ﬁssion and modulational instability techniques will be implemented to investigate the impact of slow nonlinear response and saturable nonlinear response respectively, in SCG process.</p>

				<page>0975-0986</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study of the dynamics of 1D chains with both harmonic and nonlinear interactions, as in the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam (FPU) and related problems, has played a central role in efforts to identify the broad consequences of nonlinearity in these systems. Here we study the dynamics of highly localized excitations, or discrete breathers, which are known to be initiated by the quasistatic stretching of bonds between adjacent particles. We show via dynamical simulations that acoustic waves introduced by the harmonic term stabilize the discrete breather by suppressing the breather’s tendency to delocalize and disperse. We conclude that the harmonic term, and hence acoustic waves, are essential for the existence of localized breathers in these systems.</p>

				<feature>Nonlinear Waves and Solitons</feature>
				<page>0987-1005</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study theoretically the effect of truncating the nonlinear restoring force (exp $(\Phi)−1 = \Sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \Phi^n/n!$) in the bistability pattern of the periodically driven, damped one-degree-of-freedom Toda oscillator that originally exhibits soft-spring bistability with counterclockwise hysteresis cycle. We observe that if the truncation is made third order, the harmonic bistability changes to hard-spring type with a clockwise hysteresis cycle. In contrast, for the fourth-order truncation, the bistability again becomes soft-spring type, overriding the effect of third-order nonlinearity. Furthermore, each higher odd-order truncation attempts to introduce hard-spring nature while each even-order truncation turns to soft-spring type of bistability. Overall, the hard-spring effect of every odd-order nonlinear term is weaker in comparison to the soft-spring effect of the next even-order nonlinear term. As a consequence, higher-order approximations ultimately converge to the soft-spring nature. Similar approximate analysis of Toda lattice has in recent past revealed remarkably similar ﬂip-ﬂop pattern between stochasticity (chaotic behaviour) and regularity (integrability).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present computational data on the thermal conductivity of nonlinear waves in disordered chains. Disorder induces Anderson localization for linear waves and results in a vanishing conductivity. Cubic nonlinearity restores normal conductivity, but with a strongly temperature-dependent conductivity $\kappa (T)$. We ﬁnd indications for an asymptotic low-temperature $\kappa \sim T^4$ and intermediate temperature $\kappa \sim T^2$ laws. These ﬁndings are in accord with theoretical studies of wave packet spreading, where a regime of strong chaos is found to be intermediate, followed by an asymptotic regime of weak chaos (Laptyeva et al, Europhys.

				<title>A stepwise planned approach to the solution of Hilbert’s sixth problem. III: Measurements and von Neumann projection/collapse rule</title>

				<page>1031-1051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Supmech, the universal mechanics developed in the previous two papers (Dass, arXiv: 0909.4606[math-ph]; 1002:2061[math-ph]), accommodates both quantum and classical mechanics as subdisciplines (a brief outline is included for completeness); this feature facilitates, in a supmechbased treatment of quantum measurements, an unambiguous treatment of the apparatus as a quantum system approximated well by a classical one. Taking explicitly into consideration the fact that observations on the apparatus are made when it has ‘settled down after the measurement interaction’ and are restricted to macroscopically distinguishable pointer readings, the unwanted superpositions of (system $+$ apparatus) states are shown to be suppressed; this provides a genuinely physics-based justiﬁcation for the (traditionally postulated) von Neumann projection/collapse rule. The decoherence mechanism brought into play by the stated observational constraints is free from the objections against the traditional decoherence program.</p>

					<p>The light ﬂavour baryons are studied within the quark model using the hypercentral description of the three-body system. The conﬁnement potential is assumed as hypercentral Coulomb plus power potential (hCPP$_\nu$ ) with power index $\nu$. The masses and magnetic moments of light ﬂavour baryons are computed for different power indices, $\nu$, starting from 0.5 to 1.5. The predicted masses and magnetic moments are found to attain a saturated value with respect to variation in $\nu$ beyond the power index $\nu &#62; 1.0$. Further, we computed transition magnetic moments and radiative decay width of light ﬂavour baryons. The results are in good agreement with the known experimental as well as other theoretical models.</p>

General features of elliptic ﬂow are investigated with the help of theoretical simulations. The simulations are performed at beam energies between 45 and 105 MeV/nucleon. A signiﬁcant change can be seen from in-plane to out-of-plane elliptic ﬂow of different fragments with incident energy. A comparison with experimental data is also made. Further, we show that elliptic ﬂow for different fragments follows power-law dependence as given by the function $C(A_{\text{tot}})^{\tau}$.</p>

				<title>Canonical form of Nambu–Poisson bracket: A pedestrian approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1105-1117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the seventies, Nambu (Phys. Rev. {\bf D7}, 2405 (1973)) proposed a new approach to classical dynamics based on an $N$-dimensional Nambu–Poisson (NP) manifold replacing the primitive even-dimensional Poisson manifold and on $N–1$ Hamiltonians in place of a single Hamiltonian. This approach has had many promoters including Bayen and Flato (Phys. Rev. {\bf D11}, 3049 (1975)), Mukunda and Sudarshan (Phys. Rev. {\bf D13}, 2846 (1976)), and Takhtajan (Comm. Math. Phys. {\bf 160}, 295 (1994)) among others. While Nambu had originally considered $N = 3$, the illustration of his ideas for $N = 4$ and 6 was  given by Chatterjee  (Lett. Math. Phys. {\bf 36}, 117 (1996)) who observed that the classical description of dynamical systems having dynamical symmetries is described elegantly by Nambu’s formalism of mechanics. However, his considerations do not quite yield the beautiful canonical form conjectured by Nambu himself for the $N$-ary NP bracket. By making a judicious choice for the ‘extra constant of motion’ of namely, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which are the orientation angles in Kepler problem and isotropic harmonic oscillator (HO) respectively, we show that the dynamical systems with dynamical symmetries can be recast in the beautiful form suggested by Nambu. We believe that the techniques used and the theorems suggested by us in this work are of general interest because of their involvement in the transition from Hamiltonian mechanics to Nambu mechanics.</p>

The crystals were grown by hydro silica gel method under suitable pH conditions and by single diffusion method. The well-grown crystals are bright and transparent. The dark green colour of these crystals changes with the variation of the concentrations of the dopant ions. The absorption spectra have been measured in the region 200–800 nm at room temperature. Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters for f–f transitions of the $Pr^{3+}$ ions have been determined as $\Omega_2 = 166.7$, $\Omega_4 = 1.103$ and $\Omega_6 = 2.898$. Analyses of the absorption spectra also show a possible energy transfer from the host material to the dopant.</p>

					<p>A scheme is proposed for achieving a controlled phase gate using interaction between atomic spin dipoles. Further, the spin states are prepared in coherent population trap states (CPTs), which are robust against perturbations, laser ﬂuctuations etc. We show that one-qubit and two-qubit operations can easily be obtained in this scheme. The scheme is also robust against decoherences due to spontaneous emissions as the CPT states used are dressed states formed out of Zeeman sublevels of ground states of the bare atom. However, certain practical issues are of concern in actually obtaining the scheme, which are also discussed at the end of this paper.</p>

				<title>Schwarzian derivative as a proof of the chaotic behaviour</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1159-1169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, a sufﬁcient condition for determining chaotic behaviours of the nonlinear systems has been characterized by the negative Schwarzian derivative (Hacıbekiroğlu et al, Nonlinear Anal.: Real World Appl. {\bf 10}, 1270 (2009)). In this work, the Schwarzian derivative has been calculated for investigating the quantum chaotic transition points in the high-temperature superconducting frame of reference, which is known as a nonlinear dynamical system that displays some macroscopic quantum effects. In our previous works, two quantum chaotic transition points of the critical transition temperature, $T_c$, and paramagnetic Meissner transition temperature, $T_{\text{PME}}$, have been phenomenologically predicted for the mercury-based high-temperature superconductors (Onbaşlı et al, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals {\bf 42}, 1980 (2009); Aslan et al, J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. {\bf 153}, 012002 (2009); Çataltepe, Superconductor (Sciyo Company, India, 2010)). The $T_c$, at which the one-dimensional global gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken, refers to the second-order phase transition, whereas the $T_{\text{PME}}$, at which time reversal symmetry is broken, indicates the change in the direction of orbital current in the system (Onbaşlı et al, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals {\bf 42}, 1980 (2009)). In this context, the chaotic behaviour of the mercury-based high-temperature superconductors has been investigated by means of the Schwarzian derivative of the magnetic moment versus temperature. In all calculations, the Schwarzian derivatives have been found to be negative at both $T_c$ and $T_{\text{PME}}$ which are in agreement with the chaotic behaviour of the system.</p>

				<title>Grazing incidence polarized neutron scattering in reﬂection geometry from nanolayered spintronic systems</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0001-0058</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This review summarizes recent experimental investigations using neutron scattering on layered nanomagnetic systems (accentuating my contribution), which have applications in spintronics also. Polarized neutron investigations of such artiﬁcially structured materials are basically done to understand the interplay between structure and magnetism conﬁned within the nanometer scale that can be additionally depth-resolved. Details of the identiﬁcation of buried domains and their nature of lateral and vertical correlations within the systems are important. A particularly interesting aspect that has emerged over the years is the capability to measure polarized neutron scattering in directions parallel and perpendicular to the applied ﬁeld direction (which is also the quantization axis for neutron polarizations). This was added with the capability of measuring in specular as well as in off-specular geometry. Distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) theory for neutrons has proved to be a remarkable development in the quantitative analysis of the scattering data measured simultaneously for specular and off-specular modes within the same framework. In particular, the depth and lateral distribution of the ferromagnetic spins relative to the interface within interlayercoupled or exchange-coupled system has been extensive. For example, twisted magnetization state at interlayer coupled interfaces or intricacies of symmetric and asymmetric magnetization reversals along with suppression of training effect in exchange coupled system was microscopically identiﬁed using neutron scattering only. The investigation on the distribution of magnetic species within dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor superlattices, with low angle neutron scattering, has played a crucial role both from practical and fundamental research points of view.</p>

				<title>Optical probing of Eu ions conﬁned in an RF trap</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0109-0120</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Eu ions conﬁned in an RF quadrupole trap, has been optically detected. Using a tunable dye laser which is pumped by a Nd-YAG pulsed laser system, the resonance ${}^9S_4–6 p_{3/2}$, $J = 5$ transition of the Eu ions have been excited and the resulting ﬂuorescence to the metastable ${}^9 D_{4−6}$ state has been detected. In preparation to determine the ground-state hyperﬁne splitting of the odd isotopes we found the optimum trapping operating point. We have also observed a number of instabilities inside the region of the stability for an ideal trap. These non-linear resonances arise from higher-order contributions to the ideal quadrupole potential.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>By using reductive perturbation method, the nonlinear propagation of dust-acoustic waves in a dusty plasma (containing a negatively charged dust ﬂuid, Boltzmann distributed electrons and two-temperature nonthermal ions) is investigated. The effects of two-temperature nonthermal ions on the basic properties of small but ﬁnite amplitude nonlinear dust-acoustic waves are examined.

				<title>The width of Liesegang bands: A study using moving boundary model and simulation</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0135-0145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pattern formation in reaction–diffusion systems was studied by invoking the provisions contained in the moving boundary model. The model claims that the phase separation mechanism is responsible for separating the colloidal phase of precipitants into band and non-band regions. The relation between the band separation and its width are invariably related to the concentration of the reacting components. It was observed that this model provides critical condition for the band formation in semi-idealized diffusion systems. An algorithm for generating the band structure was designed, and the simulated pattern shows a close resemblance with the experimentally observed ones.</p>

				<title>Theoretical calculation of the Hall mobility of InN$_x$As$_{1−x}$ alloys when $x = 0.0–0.1$</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0147-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Hall mobility of InN$_x$As$_{1−x}$ semiconductor alloys is calculated by solving the Boltzmann transport equation using the iterative method. All the major scattering mechanisms are included in the calculations. The Hall mobilities of InAs and InN$_{0.01}$As$_{0.99}$ are presented in the temperature range of 30–600 K. It is shown that incorporation of even small amount of nitrogen leads to an abrupt reduction of the Hall mobility in InN$_x$As$_{1−x}$ at low temperatures. The effect of alloy random scattering on the Hall mobility of InN$_x$As$_{1−x}$ is examined at 77 and 300 K as the mole fraction x varies from 0.0 to 0.1. It is seen that the Hall mobility drops sharply up to $x = 0.02$ for 77 K and reduces slowly as the temperature increases to 300 K compared to 77 K. The Hall mobilities calculated theoretically are compared with the experimental data available in the literature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the octonion algebra and its general properties are deﬁned by the Cayley–Dickson’s multiplication rules for octonion units. The ﬁeld equations, potential equations and Maxwell equations for electromagnetism are investigated with the octonionic equations and these equations can be compared with their vectorial representations. The potential and wave equations for ﬁelds with sources are also provided. By using Maxwell equations, a Lorenz-like condition is newly suggested for electromagnetism. The existing equations including the photon mass provide the most acknowledged Lorenz condition for the magnetic monopole and the source.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple one-dimensional model for the system–apparatus interaction is analysed. The system is a spin-1/2 particle, and its position and momentum degrees constitute the apparatus. An analysis involving only unitary Schrödinger dynamics illustrates the nature of the correlations established in the system–apparatus entangled state. It is shown that even in the absence of any environment-induced decoherence, or any other measurement model, certain initial states of the apparatus – like localized Gaussian wavepackets – are preferred over others, in terms of measurementlike one-to-one correlations in the pure system–apparatus entangled state.</p>

					<p>Coupled discrete models abound in several areas of physics. Here we provide an extensive set of exact quasiperiodic solutions of a number of coupled discrete models in terms of Lamé polynomials of order one and two. Some of the models discussed are: (i) coupled Salerno model, (ii) coupled Ablowitz–Ladik model, (iii) coupled saturated discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation, (iv) coupled $\phi^4$ model and (v) coupled $\phi^6$ model. Furthermore, we show that most of these coupled models in fact also possess an even broader class of exact solutions.</p>

					<p>In this study, a coupled-channel (CC) analysis of the elastic and the inelastic scattering of 20.4 MeV polarized protons from a ${}^{64}$Zn target leading to the deformed $2^+$, $3^−$, $2^+_2$ states was performed. The CC potential parameters and the deformation parameters of the excited states corresponding to the best ﬁt to the experimental differential cross-sections and the analysing powers data were determined. For $2^+_2$ excited state, a mixed type was used and a good ﬁt to the data was provided. The CC calculation results were compared to the pure distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) calculation results which were calculated using the new parameters. All calculations were conducted using the computer code ECIS06.</p>

				<title>Physics design of a CW high-power proton Linac for accelerator-driven system</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0247-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Accelerator-driven systems (ADS) have evoked lot of interest the world over because of their capability to incinerate the MA (minor actinides) and LLFP (long-lived ﬁssion products) radiotoxic waste and their ability to utilize thorium as an alternative nuclear fuel. One of the main subsystems of ADS is a high energy ($\sim$1 GeV) and high current ($\sim$30 mA) CW proton Linac. The accelerator for ADS should have high efﬁciency and reliability and very low beam losses to allow hands-on maintenance. With these criteria, the beam dynamics simulations for a 1 GeV, 30 mA proton Linac has been done. The Linac consists of normal-conducting radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ), drift tube linac (DTL) and coupled cavity drift tube Linac (CCDTL) structures that accelerate the beam to about 100 MeV followed by superconducting (SC) elliptical cavities, which accelerate the beam from 100 MeV to 1 GeV. The details of the design are presented in this paper.</p>

				<page>0257-0264</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper the photonuclear interaction induced by 10 MeV electron beam generating high-intensity neutrons is studied. Since the results depend on the target material, the calculations are performed for Pb, Ta and W targets which have high $Z$, in a simple geometry. MCNPX code has been used to simulate the whole process. Also, the results of photon generation has been compared with the experimental results to evaluate the reliability of the calculation. The results show that the obtained neutron ﬂux can reach up to 10$^{12}$ n/cm$^2$ /s with average energies of 0.9 MeV, 0.4 MeV and 0.9 MeV for these three elements respectively with the maximum heat deposited as 3000 W/c$^3$,4500 W/c$^3$ and 6000 W/c$^3$.</p>

				<title>Formation of multiple dark photovoltaic spatial solitons</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0265-0275</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We theoretically study the formation of multiple dark photovoltaic soliton splitting in the quasi-steady-state and steady-state regimes under open-circuit conditions. We ﬁnd that the initial width of the dark notch at the entrance face of the crystal is a key parameter for generating an even (or odd) number sequence of dark coherent photovoltaic solitons. If the initial width of the dark notch is small, only a fundamental soliton or Y-junction soliton pair is generated. As the initial width of the dark notch is increased, the dark notch tends to split into an odd (or even) number of multiple dark photovoltaic solitons, which realizes a progressive transition from a low-order soliton to a sequence of higher-order solitons. The soliton pairs far away from the centre have bigger width and less visibility. In addition, when the distance from the centre of the dark notch increases, the separations between adjacent dark stripes become slightly smaller.</p>

				<page>0277-0288</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here an experimental study of the ionic keV X-ray line emission from magnesium plasma produced by laser pulses of three widely different pulse durations (FWHM) of 45 fs, 25 ps and 3 ns, at a constant laser ﬂuence of $\sim 1.5 \times 10^4$ J cm$^{−2}$. It is observed that the X-ray yield of the resonance lines from the higher ionization states such as H- and He-like ions decreases on decreasing the laser pulse duration, even though the peak laser intensities of $3.5 \times 10^{17}$ W cm$^{−2}$ for the 45 fs pulses and $6.2 \times 10^{14}$ W cm$^{−2}$ for the 25 ps pulses are much higher than $5 \times 10^{12}$ W cm$^{−2}$ for the 3 ns laser pulse. The results were explained in terms of the ionization equilibrium time for different ionization states in the heated plasma. The study can be useful to make optimum choice of the laser pulse duration to produce short pulse intense X-ray line emission from the plasma and to get the knowledge of the degree of ionization in the plasma.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The two-dimensional (2D) extended Falicov–Kimball model has been studied to observe the role of nonlocal Coulomb interaction ($U_{\text{nc}}$) using an exact diagonalization technique. The f-state occupation ($n^f$), the f–d intersite correlation function ($c_{\text{fd}}$), the speciﬁc heat ($C$), entropy ($S$) and the speciﬁc heat coefﬁcient ($\gamma$) have been examined. Nonlocal Coulomb interaction-induced discontinuous insulator-to-metal transition occurs at a critical f-level energy. More ordered state is obtained with the increase of $U_{\text{nc}}$. In the speciﬁc heat curves, two-peak structure as well as a singlepeak structure appears. At low-temperature region, a sharp rise in the speciﬁc heat coefﬁcient $\gamma$ is observed. The peak value of $\gamma$ shifts to the higher temperature region with $U_{\text{nc}}$.</p>

				<page>0309-0318</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thin ﬁlms of Se$_{85−x}$Te$_{15}$Zn$_x$ ($x = 0$, 2, 4, 6 and 10) glassy alloys have been deposited onto a chemically cleaned glass substrate by thermal evaporation technique under vacuum. The analysis of transmission spectra, measured at normal incidence, in the spectral range of 400–2500 nm helped us in the optical characterization of thin ﬁlms under study. From the analysis of transmission spectra, the optical parameters such as refractive index ($n$), extinction coefﬁcient ($k$), absorption coefﬁcient ($\alpha$), real and imaginary dielectric constants ($\epsilon'$ and $\epsilon"$) have been calculated. It is observed that the parameters $n$, $k$, $\epsilon'$, $\epsilon"$ and $\alpha$ decrease with increase in wavelength ($\lambda$) and increase with Zn content. Optical band gap ($E_g$) has also been calculated and found to decrease with Zn content in Se$_{85−x}$Te$_{15}$Zn$_x$ glassy system which could be correlated with increase in the density of defect states.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>TiO$_2$ Nano rods can be used as dye-sensitized solar cells, various sensors and photocatalysts. These nanorods are synthesized by a hydrothermal corrosion process in NaOH solution at $200^\circ$C using  TiO$_2$ powder as the source material. In the present work, the synthesis of TiO$_2$ nanorods in anatase, rutile and Ti$_7$O$_{13}$ phases and synthesis of TiO$_2$ nanorods by incorporating SiO$_2$ dopant, using the sol–gel method and alkaline corrosion are reported. The morphologies and crystal structures of the TiO2 nanorods are characterized using ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The obtained results show not only an aggregation structure at high calcination temperatures with spherical particles but also Ti–O–Si bonds having four-fold coordination with oxygen in SiO$^{4−}$.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear resonance in Dufﬁng oscillator with ﬁxed and integrative time-delayed feedbacks</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0347-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study the nonlinear resonance, one of the fundamental phenomena in nonlinear oscillators, in a damped and periodically-driven Dufﬁng oscillator with two types of time-delayed feedbacks, namely, ﬁxed and integrative. Particularly, we analyse the effect of the time-delay parameter $\alpha$ and the strength $\gamma$ of the time-delayed feedback. Applying the perturbation theory we obtain a nonlinear equation for the amplitude of the periodic response of the system. For a range of values of $\gamma$ and $\alpha$, the response amplitude is found to be higher than that of the system in the absence of delayed feedback. The response amplitude is periodic on the parameter $\alpha$ with period $2\pi /\omega$ where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the external periodic force. We show the occurrence of multiple branches of the response amplitude curve with and without hysteresis.</p>

				<title>Robust chaos synchronization based on adaptive fuzzy delayed feedback $\mathcal_{\infty}$ control</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0361-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we propose a new adaptive $\mathcal_{\infty}$ synchronization strategy, called an adaptive fuzzy delayed feedback $\mathcal_{\infty}$ synchronization (AFDFHS) strategy, for chaotic systems with uncertain parameters and external disturbances. Based on Lyapunov–Krasovskii theory, Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model and adaptive delayed feedback $\mathcal_{\infty}$ control scheme, the AFDFHS controller is presented such that the synchronization error system is asymptotically stable with a guaranteed $\mathcal_{\infty}$ performance. It is shown that the design of the AFDFHS controller with adaptive law can be achieved by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI), which can be easily facilitated by using some standard numerical packages. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AFDFHS approach.</p>

				<title>Multiple ($G'/G$)-expansion method and its applications to nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0375-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, an extended multiple ($G'/G$)-expansion method is proposed to seek exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. The validity and advantages of the proposed method is illustrated by its applications to the Sharma–Tasso–Olver equation, the sixth-order Ramani equation, the generalized shallow water wave equation, the Caudrey–Dodd–Gibbon–Sawada–Kotera equation, the sixth-order Boussinesq equation and the Hirota–Satsuma equations. As a result, various complexiton solutions consisting of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, rational functions and their mixture with parameters are obtained. When some parameters are taken as special values, the known double solitary-like wave solutions are derived from the double hyperbolic function solution. In addition, this method can also be used to deal with some high-dimensional and variable coefﬁcients’ nonlinear evolution equations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polarization property is important to the optical imaging system. It has recently been understood that the polarization properties of light can be fruitfully used for improving the characteristics of imaging system that includes polarizing devices. The vector wave imagery lends an additional degree of freedom that can be utilized for obtaining results that are unobtainable in scalar wave imagery. This calls for a systematic study of diffraction properties of different apertures using polarization-sensitive devices. In the present paper, we have studied the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of slits masked by different kinds of polarizing devices which introduce a phase difference between the two orthogonal components of the incident beam.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The capability of various metals used in optical ﬁbre-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing is studied theoretically. Four metals, gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu) and aluminium (Al) are considered for the present study. The performance of the optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor with four different metals is obtained numerically and compared in detail. The performance of optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor has been analysed in terms of sensitivity, signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and quality parameter. It is found that the performance of optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor with Au metal is better than that of the other three metals. The sensitivity of the optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor with 50 nm thick and 10 mm long Au metal ﬁlm of exposed sensing region is 2.373 $\mu$m/RIU with good linearity, SNR is 0.724 and quality parameter is 48.281 RIU$^{−1}$. The thickness of the metal ﬁlm and the length of the exposed sensing region of the optical ﬁbre-based SPR sensor for each metal are also optimized.</p>

					<p>The present note deals with the effects of radiative heat transfer and free convection in MHD for a ﬂow of an electrically conducting, incompressible, dusty viscous ﬂuid past an impulsively started vertical non-conducting plate, under the inﬂuence of transversely applied magnetic ﬁeld. The heat due to viscous dissipation and induced magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be negligible. The governing linear partial differential equations are solved by ﬁnite difference technique. The effects of various parameters (like radiation parameter $N$, Prandtl number Pr, porosity parameter $K$) entering into the MHD Stokes problem for ﬂow of dusty conducting ﬂuid have been examined on the temperature ﬁeld and velocity proﬁle for both the dusty ﬂuid and dust particles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The modulation instability of an intense circularly polarized laser beam propagating in an unmagnetized, cold electron–positron–ion plasma is investigated. Adopting a generalized Karpman method, a three-dimensional nonlinear equation is shown to govern the laser ﬁeld. Then the conditions for modulation instability and the temporal growth rate are obtained analytically. In order to compare with the usual electron–ion plasmas, the effect of positron concentration is considered. It is found that the increase in positron-to-electron density ratio shifts the instability region towards higher vertical wave numbers but does not cause displacement along the parallel wave number direction, and the growth rate increases as the positron-to-electron density ratio increases.</p>

					<p>The lifetimes of quantum excitations are directly related to the electron and phonon energy linewidths of a particular scattering event. Using the versatile double time thermodynamic Green’s function approach based on many-body theory, an ab-initio formulation of relaxation times of various contributing processes has been investigated with newer understanding in terms of the linewidths of electrons and phonons. The energy linewidth is found to be an extremely sensitive quantity in the transport phenomena of crystalline solids as a collection of large number of scattering processes, namely, boundary scattering, impurity scattering, multiphonon scattering, interference scattering, electron–phonon processes and resonance scattering. The lattice thermal conductivities of three samples of GaAs have been analysed on the basis of modiﬁed Callaway model and a fairly good agreement between theory and experimental observations has been reported.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using the ﬁrst-principles calculations, electronic properties for the F-terminated AlN nanoribbons with both zigzag and armchair edges are studied. The results show that both the zigzag and armchair AlN nanoribbons are semiconducting and nonmagnetic, and the indirect band gap of the zigzag AlN nanoribbons and the direct band gap of the armchair ones decrease monotonically with increasing ribbon width. In contrast, the F-terminated AlN nanoribbons have narrower band gaps than those of the H-terminated ones when the ribbons have the same bandwidth. The densityof-states (DOS) and local density-of-states (LDOS) analyses show that the top of the valence band for the F-terminated ribbons is mainly contributed by N atoms, while at the side of the conduction band, the total DOS is mainly contributed by Al atoms. The charge density contour analyses show that Al–F bond is ionic because the electronegativity of F atom is much stronger for F atom than for Al atom, while N–F bond is covalent because of the combined action of the stronger electronegativity and the smaller covalent radius.</p>

The Pt$^{3+}$ impurity is found to experience an outward displacement by about 0.18 Å away from the centre of the oxygen octahedron along the $C_3$-axis. The calculated g factors based on the above axial displacement show good agreement with the observed values. Importantly, the pending problem of $+3$ valence state of the doped Pt in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is theoretically clariﬁed, and the possibility of Pt$^+$ ($5d^9$) is thus excluded in this work.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>On systematically investigating the electromagnetic response of periodic split-ring resonator (SRR) metamaterials as a function of the size-to-wavelength ($a/\lambda$) ratio, we ﬁnd that the stop bands due to the geometric resonances of the SRR weaken with increasing ($a/\lambda$) ratio, and are eventually replaced by stop bands due to Bragg scattering. Our study traces the behaviour of SRR-based metamaterials as the resonance frequency increases and the wavelength of the radiation ﬁnally becomes comparable to the size of the unit cell of the metamaterial. In the intermediate stages, the dispersion of the SRR metamaterial can still be described as due to a localized magnetic resonances while Bragg scattering ﬁnally becomes the dominant phenomenon as $a/\lambda \sim 1/2$.</p>

					<p>Fission fragments and other charged particles leave tracks of permanent damage in most of the insulating solids. Damage track detectors are useful for personal dosimeters and for ﬂux/dose determination of high-energy particles from accelerators or cosmic rays. A detector that has its principal response at nucleon energy above 50 MeV is provided by the ﬁssion of Bi-209. Neutrons produce the largest percentage of hadron dose in most high-energy radiation ﬁelds. In these ﬁelds, the neutron spectrum is typically formed by low-energy neutrons (evaporation spectrum) and high-energy neutrons (knock-on spectrum). We used Bi-ﬁssion detectors to measure neutron peak ﬂuence and compared the result with the calculated value of neutron peak ﬂuence. For the exposure to 100 MeV we have used the iThemba Facility in South Africa.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study we have investigated the energy–momentum distributions for homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-IV in B class Universe. For this purpose, we have used energy–momentum complexes of Einstein, Bergmann–Thomson, Landau–Lifshitz (LL), Papapetrou, Tolman and Møller in general relativity (GR) as also Einstein, Bergmann–Thomson, Landau–Lifshitz and Møller in teleparallel gravity (TG). From the obtained results we have found that Einstein and Bergmann–Thomson distributions are exactly giving the same results in GR and TG but the Landau–Lifshitz, Papapetrou Tolman and Møller energy–momentum distributions do not provide the same results with Einstein and Bergmann–Thomson in GR and TG. Furthermore, Einstein, Bergmann–Thomson and LL results are the same in different gravitation theories and we get that both GR and TG are equivalent theories for these prescriptions. From the obtained solutions, we could say that these are equivalent theories. Also, Møller energy–momentum distributions do not give the same results in GR and TG. However, we have found that all energy prescriptions are negative and our results agree with Nester et al.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We deﬁne a nonlinear model for fractional relaxation phenomena. We use $\epsilon$-expansion method to analyse this model. By studying the fundamental solutions of this model we ﬁnd that when $t \to 0$ the model exhibits a fast decay rate and when $t \to \infty$ the model exhibits a power-law decay. By analysing the frequency response we ﬁnd a logarithmic enhancement for the relative ratio of susceptibility.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The proposed high current injector for the superconducting Linac at the InterUniversity Accelerator Centre will have several accelerating structures, including a superconducting module which will contain low beta niobium resonators. A prototype resonator for the low beta module has been designed. The resonator has been carefully modelled to optimize the electromagnetic parameters. In order to validate them, a room-temperature copper model has been built and tested. In this paper we present details of the electromagnetic design of the low beta resonator, brieﬂy discuss the mechanical and engineering design, and present results from the measurements on the room-temperature copper model.</p>

				<title>Light squeezing in optical parametric ampliﬁcation beyond the slowly-varying amplitude approximation</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0595-0612</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optical parametric ampliﬁcation (OPA) described usually by the coupled-wave equations with the ﬁrst-order derivatives of the signal and idler waves, is solved under the slowly-varying amplitude approximation (SVA). In this article, by keeping the second-order derivatives in the coupled-wave equations, we obtained an analytical solution for the output signal and idler waves up to the ﬁrst order of $(\kappa/k)^1$; the ratio of coupling constant to the wave number. Furthermore, here the signal and the idler waves are distinguished only by their polarizations with the same frequency. Light squeezing is observed in normally ordered variances of the two quadrature operators of the output combined mode when plotted against $\kappa L$, where $\kappa$ is the coupling constant and $L$ the interaction length. The variances have different signs for a range of values of $\kappa L$ and their variations are in opposite directions. We also show that this property is strongly dependent on the relative refractive index of the medium ($n$). It is worth mentioning that the relative index dependency is not an explicit feature in squeezing of OPA under SVA approximation. Furthermore, the squeezing vanishes when $n  \to  1$ and $\kappa /k \to 0$.</p>

				<page>0613-0623</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A sequential three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell simulation code PICPSI-3D with a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed and used to study the interaction of plasma with ultrahigh intensity laser radiation. A case study of laser–plasma-based electron acceleration has been carried out to assess the performance of this code. Simulations have been performed for a Gaussian laser beam of peak intensity $5 \times 10^{19}$ W/cm$^2$ propagating through an underdense plasma of uniform density $1 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{−3}$, and for a Gaussian laser beam of peak intensity $1.5 \times 10^{19}$ W/cm$^2$ propagating through an underdense plasma of uniform density $3.5 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{−3}$. The electron energy spectrum has been evaluated at different time-steps during the propagation of the laser beam. When the plasma density is $1 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{−3}$, simulations show that the electron energy spectrum forms a monoenergetic peak at $\sim 14$ MeV, with an energy spread of $\pm 7$ MeV. On the other hand, when the plasma density is $3.5 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{−3}$, simulations show that the electron energy spectrum forms a monoenergetic peak at $\sim 23$ MeV, with an energy spread of $\pm 7.5$ MeV.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0625-0634</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, ZnO thin ﬁlms have been prepared by spray pyrolysis deposition method on the glass substrates. The effect of deposition parameters, such as deposition rate, substrate temperature and solution volume has been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, UV–Vis–NIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrical measurements. The XRD patterns indicate polycrystalline wurtzite structure with preferred direction along (0 0 2) planes. Thin ﬁlms have transparency around 90&#37; in the visible range. The optical band gap was determined at 3.27 eV which did not change signiﬁcantly. Evolution of electrical results containing the carriers' density, sheet resistance and resistivity are in agreement with structural results. All the results suggest the best deposition parameters are: deposition rate, $R = 3$ ml/min, substrate temperature, $T_s = 450^\circ$C and thickness of the thin ﬁlms $t = 110–130$ nm.</p>

				<title>Thermal conductivity of large-grain niobium and its effect on trapped vortices in the temperature range 1.8–5 K</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0635-0649</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Experimental investigation of the thermal conductivity of large grain and its dependence on the trapped vortices in parallel magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the temperature gradient $\nabla T$ was carried out on four large-grain niobium samples from four different ingots. The zero-ﬁeld thermal conductivity measurements are in good agreement with the measurements based on the theory of Bardeen–Rickayzen–Tewordt (BRT). The change in thermal conductivity with trapped vortices is analysed with the ﬁeld dependence of the conductivity results of Vinen et al for low inductions and low-temperature situation. Finally, the dependence of thermal conductivity on the applied magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the upper critical ﬁeld $H_{c2}$ is ﬁtted with the theory of pure type-II superconductor of Houghton and Maki. Initial remnant magnetization in the sample shows a departure from the Houghton–Maki curve whereas the sample with zero trapped ﬂux qualitatively agrees with the theory. A qualitative discussion is presented explaining the reason for such deviation from the theory. It has also been observed that if the sample with the trapped vortices is cycled through $T_c$, the subsequent measurement of the thermal conductivity coincides with the zero trapped ﬂux results.</p>

				<page>0651-0665</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A model of a cloud formed by massive strings is used as a source of LRS Bianchi type-II with time-decaying vacuum energy density $\Lambda$. To construct string cosmological models, we have used the energy–momentum tensor for such strings as formulated by Letelier (1983). The high nonlinear ﬁeld equations have been solved for two types of strings: (i) massive string and (ii) Nambu string. The expansion $\theta$ in the model is assumed to be proportional to the shear $\sigma$. This condition leads to $A = \beta B^m$, where $A$ and $B$ are the metric coefﬁcients, $m$ is a constant and $\beta$ is an integrating constant. Our models are in accelerating phase which is consistent with the recent observations of supernovae type-Ia. The physical and geometrical behaviour of these models are also discussed.</p>

The models satisfy all major physical features expected in a realistic star.

					<p>In the context of $f (R)$ theories of gravity, we address the problem of ﬁnding a rotating charged black hole solution in the case of constant curvature. A new metric is obtained by solving the ﬁeld equations and we show that its behaviour is typical of a rotating charged source. In addition, we analyse the thermodynamics of the new black hole. The results ensure that the thermodynamical properties in $f (R)$ gravities are qualitatively similar to those of standard General Relativity.</p>

					<p>The nucleation rate of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) droplet is computed at ﬁnite quark chemical potential. In the course of computing the nucleation rate, the ﬁnite size effects of the QGP droplet are taken into account. We consider the phenomenological ﬂow parameter of quarks and gluons, which is dependent on quark chemical potential and we calculate the nucleation rate of the QGP droplet with this parameter. While calculating the nucleation rate, we ﬁnd that for low values of quark phenomenological parameter $\gamma q$, nucleation rate is negligible and when $\gamma_q$ increases, nucleation rate increases signiﬁcantly.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The nucleon momentum distributions (NMD) and elastic electron scattering form factors of the ground state for 1p-shell nuclei with $Z = N$ (such as ${}^6$Li, ${}^{10}$B, ${}^{12}$C and ${}^{14}$N nuclei) have been calculated in the framework of the coherent density ﬂuctuation model (CDFM) and expressed in terms of the weight function $|f(x)|^2$. The weight function has been expressed in terms of nucleon density distribution (NDD) of the nuclei and determined from the theory and the experiment. The feature of the long-tail behaviour at high-momentum region of the NMDs has been obtained by both the theoretical and experimental weight functions. The experimental form factors $F(q)$ of all the considered nuclei are very well reproduced by the present calculations for all values of momentum transfer $q$. It is found that the contributions of the quadrupole form factors $F_{C2}(q)$ in ${}^{10}$B and ${}^{14}$N nuclei, which are described by the undeformed p-shell model, are essential for obtaining a remarkable agreement between the theoretical and experimental form factors.</p>

For this purpose, by solving the Schrödinger equation in the interaction picture, the evolving state of the system is found by which the inﬂuence of the counter-rotating terms on the dynamical behaviour of atomic population inversion and the probability distribution of the cavity-ﬁeld as quantum properties is explored. The results in the atom–ﬁeld system beyond the rotating wave approximation with the gravity show that the quantum properties are not completely suppressed under certain conditions.</p>

					<p>Relativistic effects on the linear and nonlinear properties of electron plasma waves are investigated using the one-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model for a twocomponent electron–ion dense quantum plasma. Using standard perturbation technique, a nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) containing both relativistic and quantum effects has been derived. This equation has been used to discuss the modulational instability of the wave. Through numerical calculations it is shown that relativistic effects signiﬁcantly change the linear dispersion character of the wave. Unlike quantum effects, relativistic effects are shown to reduce the instability growth rate of electron plasma waves.</p>

Minerals {\bf 19}, 392 (1993)]. Our calculations were based on B3LYP Hamiltonian [A N Lazarev and A P Mirgorodsky, Phys. Chem. Minerals {\bf 18}, 231 (1991)] in $6−311+$G(2d) basis set for H$_{16}Si$_7$O$_6$ cluster and included a unit cell of the lattice. The advantage of our method is the increase in the speed of calculations and the better adaption of simulation results with the experimental data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Design of self-correction coils in a superferric dipole magnet is carried out. By adopting the self-correction coil (SCC) scheme, we can do online correction of unwanted ﬁelds inside the magnet aperture during the whole operating cycle irrespective of their origin. The self-correction coils are short-circuited superconducting coils of required symmetry placed in the useful aperture of the AC dipole magnet. Design and operation mechanism of self-correction coils in a superferric dipole magnet are discussed in this paper.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we consider a model of interacting phantom and Yang–Mills (YM) ﬁelds by assuming dilaton-type coupling. Using the speciﬁc solution for YM equation previously found by the author, we obtain simple exact solutions for the accelerated expansion of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmological model. Besides, we derive induced potentials of phantom ﬁeld corresponding to some given regimes of expansion. The effective equations of state (EoS) have been reconstructed for all types of models considered here.</p>

				<title>Effect of conduction band nonparabolicity on the optical properties in a single quantum well under hydrostatic pressure and electric ﬁeld</title>
				<feature>Brief Report</feature>
				<page>0827-0833</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of conduction band nonparabolicity on the linear and nonlinear optical properties such as absorption coefﬁcients, and changes in the refractive index are calculated in the Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As/GaAs heterostructure-based symmetric rectangular quantum well under applied hydrostatic pressure and electric ﬁeld. The electron envelope functions and energies are calculated in the effective mass equation including the conduction band nonparabolicity. The linear and nonlinear optical properties have been calculated in the density matrix formalism with two-level approximation. The conduction band nonparabolicity shifts the positions of the optical properties and decreases their strength compared to those without this correction. Both the optical properties are enhanced with the applied hydrostatic pressure. While the absorption coefﬁcients are bleached under the combined effect of high pressure and electric ﬁeld, the bleaching effect is reduced when nonparabolicity is included.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Prehistory – Starting from ’t Hooft’s (1971) we have a short look at Taylor’s and Slavnov’s works (1971–72) and at the lectures given by Rouet and Stora in Lausanne (1973) which determine the transition from pre-history to history.</p>
					<p>History – We give a brief account of the main analyses and results of the BRS collaboration concerning the renormalized gauge theories, in particular the method of the regularization-independent, algebraic renormalization, the algebraic proof of {\bf S}-matrix unitarity and that of gauge choice independence of the renormalized physics. We conclude this report with a suggestion to the crucial question: what could remain of BRS invariance beyond perturbation theory.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0865-0874</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the transport of a tracer particle through the Bose–Einstein condensate of a Bose gas. The particle interacts with the atoms in the Bose gas through two-body interactions. In the limiting regime where the particle is very heavy and the Bose gas is very dense, but very weakly interacting (‘mean-ﬁeld limit’), the dynamics of this system corresponds to classical Hamiltonian dynamics. We show that, in this limit, the particle is decelerated by emission of gapless modes into the condensate (Cerenkov radiation). For an ideal gas, the particle eventually comes to rest. In an interacting Bose gas, the particle is decelerated until its speed equals the propagation speed of the Goldstone modes of the condensate. This is a model of ‘Hamiltonian friction’. It is also of interest in connection with the phenomenon of ‘decoherence’ in quantum mechanics. This note is based on work we have carried out in collaboration with D Egli, I M Sigal and A Soffer.</p>

				<title>Charting the invisible in phase space (Abstract only)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0891-0891</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One challenge in particle physics is that not all the momenta relevant to many processes are observable. Some particles are nearly invisible (neutrinos and hypothetical neutralinos), others escape undetected down the beam pipes of colliders. One faces the task of extracting the maximum information (e.g. on the mass of the unobserved particles) from a set of more unknowns than constraining energy–momentum conservation equations. We study the simplest realistic case of current interest: single-$W$ production at a hadron collider, followed by its leptonic decay. We derive and discuss the statistically-optimal ‘singularity variable’ relevant to the measurement of the $W$ mass. In spite of its simplicity, this process is fairly non-trivial and constitutes a good ‘training’ example for the scrutiny of phenomena involving invisible objects. Our graphical analysis of the phase space is akin to that of a Dalitz plot, extended to such processes.</p>

The scattering mechanisms included are polar optical phonon, ionized impurity, acoustic phonon and intervalley phonon. It is found that the maximum peak velocity only occurs when the electric ﬁeld is increased to a value above a certain critical ﬁeld. This critical ﬁeld is strongly dependent on InN parameters.

				<title>The relationship between the doping levels and some physical properties of SnO$_{2}$:F thin ﬁlms spray-deposited on optical glass</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0137-0150</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relationship between the ﬂuorine doping level and the electrical, structural and optical properties of the SnO$_{2}$:F ﬁlms are investigated using the Hall effect measurement set-up in van der Pauw conﬁguration, the XRD patterns, UV–vis spectrophotometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The X-ray diffraction patterns taken at room temperature show that the ﬁlms are polycrystalline. The preferred directions of crystal growth in the diffractogram of SnO$_{2}$:F (FTO) ﬁlms correspond to the reﬂections from the (1 1 0), (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (3 0 1) planes. Thin ﬁlm thickness and the grain size vary from 280 to 1545 nm and from 17.45 to 33.22 nm, respectively. AFM study reveals the surface of FTO to be made of nanocrystalline particles. The electrical study reveals that the ﬁlms are degenerate and exhibit n-type electrical conductivity. The FTO ﬁlms have a minimum resistivity of $5.29 × 10^{−4} \Omega$·cm, carrier density of $0.09 × 10^{20}$ cm$^{−3}$ and mobility of 377.02 cm$^{2}$/V·s. The sprayed FTO ﬁlm has the minimum sheet resistance of 5.69 $\Omega$ /cm$^{2}$ and the highest ﬁgure-of-merit of $204 × 10^{−4} \Omega^{−1}$ at 700 nm. The resistivity attained for the doped ﬁlm in this study is lower than the values reported for 20 wt.$\%$ ﬂuorine-doped tin oxide ﬁlms prepared from the aqueous solution of SnCl$_{2}$·2H$_{2}$O precursor. The highest visible transmittance (700 nm) of the deposited ﬁlms is 91.8$\%$ for 25 wt.$\%$ ﬂuorine-doped tin oxide ﬁlms. The obtained results reveal that the structures and properties of the ﬁlms are greatly affected by doping levels. These ﬁlms are useful as conducting layers in electrochromic and photovoltaic devices.</p>

					<p>In this paper, a new gate-recessed AlGaN/GaN-based high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) on SiC substrate is proposed and its DC as well as microwave characteristics are discussed for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers using technology computer aided design (TCAD). THe two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) transport properties are discussed by solving Schödinger and Poison equations self-consistently resulting in various subbands having electron eigenvalues. From DC characteristics, the saturation drain currents are measured to be 600 mA/mm and  550 mA/mm for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively. Apart from DC, small-signal AC analysis has been done using two-port network for various microwwave parameters. The extrinsic transconductance parameters are measured to be 131.7 mS/mm at a gate voltage of $V_{gs} = -0.35$ V and 114.6 mS/mm at a gate voltage of $V_{gs} = -0.4$ V for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively. The current gain cut-off frequencies $(f_{t})$ are measured t be 27.1 GHz and 23.97 GHz in unit-gain-point method at a gate voltage of -0.4 V for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively. Similarly, the power gain cut-off frequencied $(f_{max})$ are measured to be 41 GHz and 38.5 GHz in unit-gain-point method at a gate voltage of -0.1 V for Si$_{3}$N$$_{4} and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively. Furthermore, the maximum frequency of oscillation or unit power gain (MUG = 1) cut-off frequencies for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers are measured to be 32 GHz and 28 GHz respectively from MUG curves and the unit current gain, $|h_{21}| = 1$ cut-off frequencies are measured to be 140 GHz and 75 GHz for Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$ passivation layers respectively from the $abs |h_{21}|$ curves. HEMT with Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ passivation layer giver better results than HEMT with SiO$_{2}$ passivation layer.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A communication system involves the transmission of information from source to destination and after receiving all the information all the information or a complete signal an acknowledgement is then sent to the source by the destination itself to let the source know that is (destination) has received the signal. In this paper we examine about how to reduce the time of acknowledgement to make the communication faster. In this paper we present a method of sending an acknowledgement signal, in which the last quantum (sample) of the signal is used to compute the time of acknowledgement. The formula for calculating the time of acknowledgement in the case of a continuous time signal and a discrete time signal is also derived in the paper. This technique is applicable for analog communication, digital communication and space communication.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>For the standard quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model, we point out the occurrence of simultaneous (parallel), mutually irreducible and autonomous decoherence processes. Besides the standard Brownian particle, we show that there is at least another system undergoing the dynamics described by the QBM model. We do this by selecting the two mutually irreducible, global structures (decompositions into subsystems) of the composite system of the QBM model. The generalization of this observation is a new, challenging task in the foundations of the decoherence theory. We do not place our findings in any interpretational context.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A class of general relativistic solutions in isotropic spherical polar coordinates which describe compact stars in hydrostatic equilibrium are discussed. The stellar models obtained here are characterized by four parameters, namely, $\lambda$, $k$, $A$ and $R$ of geometrical significance related to the inhomogeneity of the matter content of the star. The stellar models obtained using the solutions are physically viable for a wide range of values of the parameters. The physical features of the compact objects taken up here are studied numerically for a number of admissible values of the parameters. Observational stellar mass data are used to construct suitable models of the compact stars.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0233-0241</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we derive the Jarzynski equality (JE) for an isolated quantum system in three different cases: (i) the full evolution is unitary with no intermediate measurements, (ii) with intermediate measurements of arbitrary observables being performed, and (iii) with intermediate measurements whose outcomes are used to modify the external protocol (feedback). We assume that the measurements will involve errors that are purely classical in nature. Our treatment is based on path probability in state space for each realization. This is in contrast with the formal approach based on projection operator and density matrices. We find that the JE remains unaffected in the second case, but gets modified in the third case where the mutual information between the measured values with the actual eigenvalues must be incorporated into the relation.</p>

					<p>Production cross-sections of the therapeutic $^105$Rh radionuclide from proton-induced reactions on natural palladium target were measured using stacked-foil activation technique combined with high resolution $\gamma$-ray spectrometry at the MC50 cyclotron of the Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences.

Results are compared with the theoretical values obtained using the model codes TALYS and ALICE-IPPE. Thick target integral yields for the investigated $^105$Rh radionuclide were deduced from the threshold energy to 40 MeV. Measured data of the $^105$Rh radionuclide are important because of its potential applications in nuclear medicine and/or therapeutic purposes. Optimal production circumstances for the therapeutic $^105$Rh radionuclide using a cyclotron are discussed elaborately.</p>

					<p>The $^232$Th$(n, \gamma)$ reaction cross-section at average neutron energies of 13.5, 15.5 and 17.28 MeV from the $^7$Li$(p, n)$ reaction has been determined for the first time using activation and off-line $\gamma$-ray spectrometric technique. The $^232$Th$(n, 2n)$ cross-section at 17.28 MeV neutron energy has also been determined using the same technique. The experimentally determined $^232$Th$(n, \gamma)$ and $^232$Th$(n, 2n)$ reaction cross-sections from the present work were compared with the evaluated data of ENDF/BVII and JENDL-4.0 and were found to be in good agreement. The present data, along with literature data in a wide range of neutron energies, were interpreted in terms of competition between $^232$Th$(n, \gamma)$, $(n, f)$, $(n, nf)$ and $(n, xn)$ reaction channels. The $^232$Th$(n, \gamma)$ and $^232$Th$(n, 2n)$ reaction cross-sections were also calculated theoretically using the TALYS 1.2 computer code and were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data from the present work but were slightly higher than the literature data at lower neutron energies.</p>

				<title>Design of a 10 MeV, 352.2 MHz drift tube Linac</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0263-0274</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A conventional 10 MeV drift tube Linac is designed as a part of the $H^-$ front end accelerator system for the future Indian Spallation Neutron Source. The front end Linac consists of a 50 keV H$^-$ ion source, low energy beam transport (LEBT), a 3 MeV radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ), and a 10 MeV drift tube Linac (DTL), which will be operated at 1.25$\%$ duty factor. Cell geometry of the DTL is optimized to house quadrupole magnets and to get maximum effective shunt impedance. Transmission efficiency and various other output parameters depend on the input design parameters. Beam dynamic studies are done to maximize the transmission efficiency with minimum emittance growth. Errors in the alignment of the quadrupoles inside the drift tubes or the DTL tank alignment with respect to transport line will degrade the beam quality and may reduce the transmission efficiency. Error study is performed to assess the acceptable tolerances on various parameters. This paper describes the 2D and 3D electromagnetic and beam dynamics simulations of the 352.2 MHz, 10 MeV drift tube Linac. Details of the DTL design are reported in this paper.</p>

It can be implemented on : (A) mechanically free, electrically and magnetically open surface and (B) mechanically free, electrically and magnetically closed surface. These theoretical investigations are useful for researches in the firlds of acousto-optics, photonics and opto-acousto-electronics. Some sample calculations are carried out for BaTiO$_3$ - CoFe$_2$O$_4$ and PZT-5H-Terfenol-D composites of class $6 mm$.

				<page>0287-0297</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A time-dependent analytical thermal model of the temperature and the corresponding induced thermal stresses in continuous wave double-end-pumped laser rod are derived from the ﬁrst principle using the integral transform method. The aim of the paper is to study the effect of increasing the pumping powers while the laser crystals are still in the safe zone (i.e. far away from failure stress) and to suitably choose a crystal that achieves this task. The result of this work is compared with a well-veriﬁed ﬁnite element solution and a good agreement has been found. Some conclusions are obtained: Tm:YAP crystal, which has high thermal conductivity, low expansion coefﬁcient, low absorption coefﬁcient, low thermal factor and low product of $\gamma E/(1−\nu)$, is the best choice to reduce induced stress although it is responded and brought to thermal equilibrium faster than the other types of crystal usually used in the end-pumped solid-state laser.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0299-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The application of calibration-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (CF-LIBS) for quantitative analysis of materials, illustrated by CF-LIBS applied to a brass sample of known composition, is presented in this paper. The LIBS plasma is produced by a 355 nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a pulse duration of 6 ns focussed onto a brass sample in air at atmospheric pressure. The time-resolved atomic and ionic emission lines of Cu and Zn from the LIBS spectra recorded by an Echelle spectrograph coupled with a gated intensified charge coupled detector are used for the plasma characterization and the quantitative analysis of the sample. The time delay where the plasma is optically thin and is also in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), necessary for the elemental analysis of samples from the LIBS spectra, is deduced. An algorithm relating the experimentally measured spectral intensity values with the basic physics of the plasma is developed. Using the algorithm, the Zn and Cu concentratioins in the brass sample are determined. The analytical result obtained from the CF-LIBS technique agree well with the certified valued of the elements in the sample, with an accuracy error $&#60; 1 \%$</p>

					<p>The qubit (or a system of two quantum dots) has become a standard paradigm for studying quantum information processes. Our focus is decoherence due to interaction of the qubit with its environment, leading to noise. We consider quantum noise generated by a dissipative quantum bath. A detailed comparative study with the results for a classical noise source such as generated by a telegraph process, enebles us to set limits on the pplicability of this process $\nu is à \nu is$ its quantum counterpart, as well as lend handle on the parameters that can be tuned for analysing decoherence. Both Ohmic and non-Ohmic dissipations are treated and appropriate limits are analysed for facilitating comparison with the telegraph process.</p>

In all these cases we show that the coefﬁcients of the Lamé polynomials are such that the Lamé polynomials can be re-expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of the relevant Jacobi elliptic function.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>High-spin states of $^216$Ra $(Z = 88,N = 128)$ have been investigated through $^209$Bi($^10$B, 3n) reaction at an incident beam energy of 55 MeV and $^209$Bi($^11$B, 4n) reaction at incident beam energies ranging from 65 to 78 MeV. Based on $\gamma \gamma$ coincidence data, the level scheme for $^216$Ra has been considerably extended up to $\sim 33\hbar$ spin and 7.2 MeV excitation energy in the present experiment with placement of 28 new $\gamma$-transitions over what has been reported earlier. Tentative spin-parity assignments are done for the newly proposed levels on the basis of the DCO ratios corresponding to strong gates. Empirical shell model calculations were carried out to provide an understanding of the underlying nuclear structure.</p>

					<p>In the present work, the isospin admixtures in the nuclear ground states of the parent nuclei and isospin structure of the isobar analog resonance (IAR) states have been investigated by studying the $0^{+} \rightarrow 0^{+}$ superallowed Fermi $\beta$ decays using Pyatov’s restoration method.

				<abstract>
					<p>The factors influencing the trajectory of long-range $\alpha$-particle in the cold ternary fission of $^252$Cf are discussed. The trajectory of the $\alpha$-particle is studied by considering the influence of the force on the $\alpha$-particle due to Coulomb and proximity potentials and is found to have sensitive dependence on the initial position and initial energy of the $\alpha$-particle. The sensitivity to initial conditions signifies the presence of deterministic chaos which is characterized by Lyapunov exponent (LE). The LE is calculated using Wolf’s algorithm and found positive which implies that the objectives of trajectory calculations are restricted.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Considering interactions and scattering of positrons with argon (Ar) and krypton (Kr) atoms, we have calculated total cross-sections $(Q_{T} = Q_{el} + Q_{inel})$ using complex spherical potentials for these systems. In positron–atom scattering it is difficult to bifurcate the ionization and cumulative excitation contained in the total inelastic cross-section. An approximate method called CSP-ic (complex scattering potential-ionization contribution) similar to electron–atom scattering has been applied to bifurcate ionization and cumulative excitation cross-sections at energies from the threshold to 2000 eV. Adequate comparisons of the present results are made, with available data.</p>

				<page>0443-0456</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electric field enhancement inside a nanotube irradiated by intense ultrashort laser pulse ($\ll 1$ ps) is calculated. The hollowness of the nanotubes determines the field enhancement and the electron density at which such structures exhibit resonance. The electric field in a nanotube plasma is shown to be resonantly enhanced at multiple densities during the two phases of interaction: the ionization phase and the hydrodynamic expansion phase. It is further shown that by a proper choice of hollowness of the nanotubes, a continued occurrence of the resonance over a longer time can be achieved. These properties make nanotubes efficient absorbers of intense ultrashort laser pulses.</p>

				<title>Swelling/deswelling of polyacrylamide gels in aqueous NaCl solution: Light scattering and macroscopic swelling study</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0457-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Swelling kinetics of water-swollen polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels (WSG) was investigated in various concentrations of aqueous NaCl by macroscopic swelling measurements. For lower concentration of NaCl, WSG showed exponential swelling whereas at higher concentration of NaCl it underwent deswelling at short times and exponential swelling at long times. From these studies, collective diffusion coefficient, $D$, of the polymer network and polymer–solvent interaction parameter, $\chi$ , were calculated and found to decrease with increase in [NaCl]. Collective diffusion coefficients measured from dynamic light scattering (DLS) and that obtained from macroscopic swelling measurements are found to agree well. Measured ensemble-averaged dynamic structure factor $f (q, t)$ for WSG and salt-swollen gels (SSG) showed an initial decay followed by a plateau at long times and it can be described by harmonically bound Brownian particle (HBBP) model. Enhanced scattering intensity at low scattering angles using static light scattering (SLS) measurements revealed the presence of inhomogeneities in PAAm gels. The reasons for increased scattering intensity of SSG over WSG gel and the linear decrease of $D$ with increase in NaCl concentration are explained.</p>

				<title>Probing ultrafast carrier dynamics, nonlinear absorption and refraction in core–shell silicon nanowires</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0471-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the relaxation dynamics of photogenerated carriers in silicon nanowires consisting of a crystalline core and a surrounding amorphous shell, using femtosecond time resolved differential reflectivity and transmission spectroscopy at 3.15 eV and 1.57 eV photon energies. The complex behaviour of the differential transmission and reflectivity transients is the mixed contributions from the crystalline core and the amorphous silicon on the nanowire surface and the substrate where competing effects of state-filling and photoinduced absorption govern the carrier dynamics. Faster relaxation rates are observed on increasing the photogenerated carrier density. Independent experimental results on crystalline silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) help us in separating the contributions from the carrier dynamics in crystalline core and the amorphous regions in the nanowire samples. Further, single-beam z-scan nonlinear transmission experiments at 1.57 eV in both open- and close-aperture configurations yield two-photon absorption coefficient $\beta$ ($\sim$3 cm/GW) and nonlinear refraction coefficient $\gamma$ ($−2.5 × 10^{−4}$ cm$^2$ /GW).</p>

					<p>In this paper we study the Indian highway network as a complex network where the junction points are considered as nodes, and the links are formed by an existing connection. We explore the topological properties and community structure of the network. We observe that the Indian highway network displays small-world properties and is assortative in nature. We also identify the most important road-junctions (or cities) in the highway network based on the betweenness centrality of the node. This could help in identifying the potential congestion points in the network. Our study is of practical importance and could provide a novel approach to reduce congestion and improve the performance of the highway network.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0493-0499</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Random geographical networks are realistic models for wireless sensor networks which are used in many applications. Achieving average consensus is very important in sensor networks and the faster the consensus is, the durable the sensors’ life, and thus, the better the performance of the network. In this paper we compared the performance of a number of linear consensus algorithms with application to distributed averaging in random geographical networks. Interestingly, the simplest algorithm – where only the degree of receiving nodes is needed for the averaging – had the best performance in terms of the consensus time. Furthermore, we proved that the network has guaranteed convergence with this simple algorithm.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We examine the role of space-time geometry in the non-adiabatic collapse of a star dissipating energy in the form of radial heat flow, studying its evolution under different initial conditions. The collapse of a star filled with a homogeneous perfect fluid is compared with that of a star filled with inhomogeneous imperfect fluid under anisotropic pressure. Both the configurations are spherically symmetric. However, in the latter case, the physical space $t$ = constant of the configurations endowed with spheroidal or pseudospheroidal geometry is assumed to be inhomogeneous. It is observed that as long as the collapse is shear-free, its evolution depends only on the mass and size of the star at the onset of collapse.</p>

					<p>The theoretical aspects of the physics of Higgs bosons are reviewed focussing on the elements that are relevant for the production and detection at present hadron colliders. After briefly summarizing the basics of electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model, the Higgs production at the LHC and at the Tevatron is discussed, with some focus on the main production mechanism, the gluon–gluon fusion process, and the main Higgs decay modes and the experimental detection channels are discussed. Then the case of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model is briefly surveyed. In the last section, the prospects for determining the fundamental properties of the Higgs particles are reviewed, once they have been experimentally observed.</p>

However, the top quark is still interesting due to unique features which originate from the extremely heavy mass, and providing various test grounds on the Standard Model as well as searches for a new physics. Though the measurements of the top quark had been performed only at Tevatron so far, LHC is now ready for measurements with more top quarks than Tevatron.

				<page>0719-0735</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>On November 8, 2010 the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN collided the ﬁrst stable beams of heavy ions (Pb on Pb) at the centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV/nucleon. The LHC worked exceedingly well during its one month of operation with heavy ions, delivering about 10 $\mu$b$^−1$ of data, with peak luminosity reaching to $L_{O} = 2 × 10^25$ cm$^−2$ s$^−1$ towards the end of the run. Three experiments, ALICE, ATLAS and CMS, recorded their ﬁrst heavy-ion data, which were analysed in a record time. The results of the multiplicity, ﬂow, ﬂuctuations and Bose–Einstein correlations indicate that the ﬁreball formed in nuclear collisions at the LHC is hotter, lives longer, and expands to a larger size at freeze-out as compared to lower energies. We give an overview of these as well as new results on quarkonia and heavy ﬂavour suppression, and jet energy loss.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The good agreement between lattice predictions and data for the shape of the distribution of event-by-event fluctuations of the baryon number is discussed. Such comparisons can give fine probes of thermalization, and can be used to provide a direct determination of the cross-over temperature $T_{c}$ QCD. The logic of these comparisons and the systematics involved are discussed. The same methods can be used to further explore the phase diagram.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Low-energy solar neutrino detection plays a fundamental role in understanding both solar astrophysics and particle physics. After introducing the open questions on both ﬁelds, we review here the major results of the last two years and expectations for the near future from Borexino, Super-Kamiokande, SNO and KamLAND experiments as well as from upcoming (SNO$+$) and planned (LENA) experiments. Scintillator neutrino detectors are also powerful antineutrino detectors which can detect neutrinos emitted by the Earth crust and mantle. First measurements of geoneutrinos have occurred which can bring fundamental contribution in understanding the geophysics of the planet.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The $t\bar{t} + 1-{\text{jet}} + X$ differential cross-section in proton-proton collissions at 7 TeV centre of mass energy is investigated with respect to its sensitivity to the top quark mass. The analysis includes higher order QCD corrections at NLO. The impact of the renormalization scale $(\mu_{\text{R}})$, the factorization $(\mu_{\text{F}})$ scale and of the choice of different proton's PDF (parton distribution function) has been evaluated. In this study it is concluded that differential jet rates offer a promising option for alternative mass measurements of the top quark, with theoretical uncertainties below 1 GeV.</p>

					<p>The compact muon solenoid (CMS) is one of the four experiments which is getting and analysing the results of the collision of protons at LHC. The CMS trigger system is divided into two stages, the level-1 trigger and high-level triggers, to handle the large stream of data produced in collision. The information transmitted from the three muon subsystems (DT, CSC and RPC) are collected by the Global Muon Trigger (GMT) Board and merged. A method for evaluating the RPC system trigger efﬁciency with data from $pp$ collision was developed using the features of GMT. The results of the study with the real data of 2011 are shown and discussed here along with the comparison of Monte Carlo results</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A search for the Standard Model boson decaying to two $Z$ bosons with a subsequent decay to a final state with two leptons and two quark jets, $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow l^{+}l^{-} q\bar{q}$, is presented. Data corresponding to an ntegrated luminosity of 1.6 fb$^{-1}$ of LHC proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV were collected and analysed by the CMS experiment. The selection to discriminate between signal and background events is based on kinematic and topological quantities, which include the angular spin correlations of the decay products. The events are classified according to the probability of the jets to originate from quarks of light or heavy flavour or from gluons. No evidence for a Higgs boson is found and upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross-section are set in the range of masses between 226 and 600 GeV/c$^2$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present the measurements of the differential cross-sections for inclusive electron and muon production in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, using $\sim$ 1.4 pb$^{−1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.

In addition, the electron and muon cross-sections are measured in the range $7 &#60; p_{\text{T}} &#60; 26$ GeV and within $|\eta| &#60; 2.0$, excluding $1.37 &#60; |\eta| &#60; 1.52$.

				<abstract>
					<p>Results are presented on a search for charged massive long-lived particles (CMLLPs), based on 5.2 fb$^−1$ of integrated luminosity collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar{p}$ collider. This search selects events in which one or more particles are reconstructed as muons but their speed and ionization energy loss (d$E$/d$x$) are different from muons produced in beam–beam collisions. CMLLPs have been predicted by several theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. In this search we exclude pair-produced long-lived gaugino-like charginos with masses below 251 GeV and higgsino-like charginos with masses below 230 GeV at $95\%$ CL, as well as long-lived stop quarks with masses below 265 GeV. We place cross-section limits on long-lived staus as 0.04 to 0.006 pb for stau masses in the range 100 to 300 GeV.</p>

				<title>Flavoured co-annihilation</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0849-0852</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) or CMSSM, one of the main co-annihilating partners of the neutralino is the lightest stau, $\tilde{\tau}_{1}$. In the presence of flavour violation in the right-handed sector, the co-annihilating partner would be a flavour mixed state. The flavour effect is two-fold: (a) It changes the mass of $\tlide{\tau}_{1}$, thus modifying the parameter space of the co-annihilation and (b) flavour violating scatterings could now contibute to the cross-sections in the early Universe. In fact, it is shown that for large enough $\delta \sim 0.2$, these processes would constitute the dominant channels in co-annihilation regions. The amount of flavour mixing permissible is constrained by flavour violating $\tau \rightarrow \mu$ or $\tau \rightarrow e$ processes. For $\Delta_{\text{RR}}$ mass insertions, the constraints from flavour violation are not strong enough in some regions of the parameter space dur to partial cancellations in the amplitudes. In mSUGRA, the regions with cancelations within LFV amplitudes do not overlap with the regions of co-annihilations. In non-universal HIggs model (NUHM), however, these regions do overlap leading to significant flavoured co-annihilations. At the LHC and other colliders, these regions can constitute for interesting signals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The study of formation of heavy quarkonia in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides important insight into the properties of the produced high-density QCD medium. Lattice QCD studies show sequential suppression of quarkonia states with increasing temperature; which affirms that a full spectroscopy can provide us a thermometer for the matter produced under extreme conditions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and one of the most direct probes of deconfinement. Muons from the decay of charmonium resonances are detected in ALICE experiment in $p + p$ and Pb $+$ Pb collisions with a muon spectrometer, covering the forward rapidity region $(2.5 &#60; y &#60; 4)$. The analysis of the inclusive $J/\psi$ production in the first Pb $+$ Pb data collected in the fall of 2010 at a centre of mass energy of $\sqrt{^{s}NN} = 2.76$ TeV is discussed. Preliminary results on the nuclear modification factor $(R_{AA})$ and the central to peripheral nuclear modification factor $(R_{CP})$ are presented.</p>

In this work, extending the NMSSM field content by two gauge singlets, with lepton number $+1$ and $−1$, we generate neutrino masses via the inverse see-saw mechanism at one hand and on the other hand a very light pseudoscalar becomes experimentally viable by having dominant invisible decay channels which help it to evade the existing bounds.</p>

					<p>A study of bound states of the fourth-generation quarks in the range of 500–700 GeV is presented, where the binding energies are expected to be mainly of Yukawa origin, with QCD subdominant. Near degeneracy of their masses exhibits a new `isospin'. The production of a colour- octet, isosinglet vector meson via $q\bar{q} \rightarrow \omega g$ is the most interesting. Its leading decay modes are $\pi_{8}^{\pm} W^{\mp}, \pi_{8}^{0} Z^{0}$ , and constituent quark decay, with $q\bar{q}$ and $t\bar{t'}$ and $b\bar{b'}̄ subdominant. The colour octet, isovector pseudoscalar $\pi_{8}$ meson decays via constituent quark decay, or to $W g$. This work calls for more detailed study of fourth-generation phenomena at LHC.</p>

The effects of new vector– axial vector (VA), scalar–pseudoscalar (SP) and tensor (T) interactions on the differential branching ratios, forward–backward asymmetries ($A_{\text{FB}}$ ’s), and direct CP asymmetries of $\bar{B}_{s}^{0} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, \bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow X_{s} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, \bar{B}_{s}^{0} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-} \gamma, \bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow \bar{K} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$, and $\bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow \bar{K}^{*} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ are examined. In $\bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow \bar{K}^{*} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$, we also explore the longitudinal polarization fraction $f_{\text{L}}$ and the angular asymmetries $A_{\text{T}}^{2}$ and $A_{\text{LT}}$, the direct CP asymmetries in them, as well as the triple-product CP asymmetries $A_{\text{T}}^{\text{(im)}}$ and $A_{\text{{LT}}^{\text{(im)}}$. While the new VA operators can significantly enhance most of the observables beyond the Standard Model predictions, the SP and T operators can do this only for $A_{\text{FB}}$ in $\bar{B}_{d}^{0} \rightarrow \bar{K} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$.</p>

				<title>Limits on anomalous trilinear gauge couplings at the CMS with 7TeV Large Hadron Collider data</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>0899-0902</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Diboson production in proton–proton collisions presents an opportunity to study the self-interaction between gauge bosons via anomalous trilinear gauge couplings (aTGC). The values of these couplings are fully fixed in the SM by the gauge structure. Thus, any deviation of the observed strength of the TGC from the SM prediction would indicate new physics. This paper presents the limits on anomalous $WW\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma$ and $Z\gamma \gamma$ trilinear gauge couplings in proton–proton collisions at the centre of mass energy of 7 TeV with the CMS detector.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements of differential cross-sections of $W$ boson production in association with jets, and jets containing $b$ hadrons are presented. The measurements are based on 35 pb$^−1$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, using the electron and muon decay channels of the $W$ boson. The data are found to be compatible with next-to-leading order predictions. In addition, a study of the invariant mass distribution of jet pairs produced in association with a $W$ boson is presented, based on an integrated luminosity of 1.02 fb$^−1$. The measured dijet mass shows no significant excess over the Standard Model expectation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The production of $Z$ bosons in association with at least one $b$-jet and $Z$ decaying into muons or electrons is studied. This analysis is done by using proton–proton collisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV and with data recorded by the CMS detector in 2010, representing an integrated luminosity of 36 pb$^{−1}$. A final state of two wellidentified muons or electrons and at least one $b$-tagged jet are required in order to perform this study. The event yields and shapes of kinematic variables are compared with Monte Carlo predictions from MADGRAPH. The ratio $\sigma (Z + b)/\sigma (Z + j)$ is found to be $0.054 \pm 0.016 (0.046 \pm 0.014)$ in the data for the $Z \rightarrow ee (Z \rightarrow \mu\mu)$ selection, compared to $0.043 \pm 0.005 (0.047 \pm 0.005)$ estimated from NLO theory predictions.</p>

					<p>Lepton mass hierarchies and lepton flavour violation are revisited in the framework of Randall–Sundrum models. Models with Dirac-type as well as Majorana-type neutrinos are considered. The five-dimensional $c$-parameters are fit to the charged lepton and neutrino masses and mixings using $\chi^{2}$ minimization. Leptonic flavour violation is shown to be large in these cases. Schemes of minimal flavour violation are considered for the cases of an effective LLHH operator and Dirac neutrinos and are shown to significantly reduce the limits from lepton flavour violation.</p>

					<p>The measurement of the inclusive cross-section for $Z\gamma$ production at LHC with 7 TeV proton–proton collision is presented. The electron and muon decay modes are used to reconstruct the $Z$ boson. The total cross-section is measured for photon transverse energy greater than 10 GeV and with photon and charged lepton separation in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal angle plane greater than 0.7. This study is extended by a measurement of $Z(\nu \bar{\nu})\gamma$ cross-section. A search is performed for extra dimensions in the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, Dvali framework using the final state of a graviton and photon. The limits are extended with MD $> 1.25–1.31$ TeV for $n = 2-6$. The measurement is found to be in agreement with the Standard Model prediction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A search for excited leptons, carried out with the CMS detector in $pp$ collision at the LHC with $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, is presented. The search has been performed for an associated production of a lepton and an oppositely charged excited lepton $pp \rightarrow ll^{*}$, followed by the decay $l^{*} \rightarrow l\gamma$ , resulting in $ll\gamma$ final state, where $l = e,\mu$. No excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed in the data. Interpreting the findings in the context of $l^{∗}$ production through four-fermion contact interactions and $l^{∗}$ decay via electroweak processes, upper limits are reported for $l^{∗}$ production at this collision energy and the exclusion region in the $\Lambda - M(l^{*})$ parameter space is extended beyond the previously established limits.</p>

					<p>The Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) experiment studies neutrino oscillations in a $\sim 600$ MeV muon neutrino beam sent at 295 km from the Japan Proton Accelerator Complex (J-PARC) to the Super Kamiokande (SK) detector in Kamioka. The primary goals of T2K are to search for the appearance of electron neutrinos at SK resulting from $\theta_{13} > 0$ and to precisely measure $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m_{32}^{2}$ via $\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance. We report on T2K results obtained from neutrino data taken in 2010 and 2011.</p>

					<p>The new results available this year from a number of neutrino experiments bring into stronger focus the details in the `Standard Model' of neutrino oscillations described by the PMNS mixing matrix. However, the parameters are still not known to very high precision. The next few years look bright for accelerator neutrino experiments, with much action occurring in the near future. We still have to wait a little longer, however, to be sure, but making educated guesses is needed to make plans for the future.</p>

					<p>The status of neutrino oscillations from global data are summarized. An update on the three-flavour picture and recent developments are discussed with regard to the measurement of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$. Global data currently provide an indication at $3\sigma$ that $\theta_{13}$ is non-zero. Furthermore, the status of sterile neutrino oscillation interpretations of the LSND anomaly in the light of MiniBooNE results and a recent re-evaluation of the neutrino fluxes from nuclear reactors are discussed. Despite several hints for sterile neutrinos at the eV scale, there is severe tension in the global data and no consistent description of all data is possible.</p>

					<p>This paper presents options for high-energy colliders at the energy frontier for the years to come. The immediate plans include the exploitation of the LHC at its design luminosity and energy as well as upgrades to the LHC (luminosity and energy) and to its injectors. This may be complemented by a linear electron–positron collider, based on the technology being developed by the Compact Linear Collider and by the International Linear Collider, by a high-energy electron– proton machine, the LHeC, and/or by a muon collider. This contribution describes the various future directions, all of which have a unique value to add to experimental particle physics, and concludes by outlining the key messages for the way forward.</p>

				<feature>Dark matter</feature>
				<page>1045-1057</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Matter, as we know it, makes up less than $5\%$ of the Universe. Various astrophysical observations have confirmed that one quarter of the Universe and most of the matter content in the Universe is made up of dark matter. The nature of dark matter is yet to be discovered and is one of the biggest questions in physics. Particle physics combined with astrophysical measurements of the abundance gives rise to a dark matter candidate called weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). The low density of WIMPs in the galaxies and the extremely weak nature of the interaction with ordinary matter make detection of the WIMP an extraordinarily challenging task, with abundant fakes from various radioactive and cosmogenic backgrounds with much stronger electromagnetic interaction. The extremely weak nature of the WIMP interaction dictates detectors that have extremely low naturally occurring radioactive background, a large active volume (mass) of sensitive detector material to maximize statistics, a highly efficient detector-based rejection mechanism for the dominant electromagnetic background and sophisticated analysis techniques to reject any residual background. This paper reviews currently available major technologies being pursued by various collaborations, with special emphasis on the cryogenic Ge detector technology used by the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search Collaboration (CDMS).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Many relativists have been long convinced that black hole evaporation leads to information loss or remnants. String theorists have however not been too worried about the issue, largely due to a belief that the Hawking argument for information loss is flawed in its details. A recently derived inequality shows that the Hawking argument for black holes with horizon can in fact be made rigorous. What happens instead is that in string theory, black hole microstates have no horizons. Thus the evolution of radiation quanta with $E \sim kT$ is modified by order unity at the horizon, and we resolve the information paradox.</p>

					<p>The large mass of the top quark, close to the electroweak symmetry-breaking scale, makes it a good candidate for probing physics beyond the Standard Model, including possible anomalous couplings. D0 has made measurements of single top quark production using 5.4 fb$^−1$ of integrated luminosity. The data are examined to study the Lorentz structure of the $W tb$ coupling. It is found that the data prefer the left-handed vector coupling and set upper limits on the anomalous couplings.</p>

				<title>Measurement of single top production in $pp$ collisions at 7 TeV with the CMS detector</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>1223-1226</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The measurement of $t$-channel single top cross-section in proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, using data collected with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment during the year 2010 is presented. Both the electronneutrino and muon-neutrino decay channels of $W$ boson from top decay are considered. Two complementary multivariate analysis methods to separate signal and background and to extract the cross-section for the single top produced in $t$-channel are explored. The result is compared with the most precise Standard Model theory predictions.</p>

					<p>The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is recording data from proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV since the spring of 2010. The integrated luminosity has grown nearly exponentially since then and continues to rise fast. The ATLAS Collaboration has set up a framework to automatically process the rapidly growing dataset and produce performance and physics plots for the most interesting analyses. The system is designed to give fast feedback. The histograms are produced within hours of data reconstruction (2–3 days after data taking). Hints of potentially interesting physics signals obtained this way are followed up by physics groups.</p>

					<p>The main injector particle production (MIPP) experiment at Fermilab uses particle beams of charged pions, kaons, proton and antiproton with beam momenta of 5–90 GeV/c to measure particle production cross-sections of various nuclei including liquid hydrogen, MINOS target and thin targets of beryllium, carbon, bismuth and uranium. The physics motivation to perform such cross-section measurements is described here. Recent results on the analysis of NuMI target and forward neutron cross-sections are presented here. Preliminary cross-section measurements for 58 GeV/c proton on liquid hydrogen target are also presented.

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of an anomalous $\gamma W W$ coupling in the $e^{-} \gamma \rightarrow \nu_{e} W^{-}$ process through the angular and energy spectrum of the secondary leptons is investigated. Within the narrowwidth-approximation (NWA), a semianalytical study of the secondary lepton energy angle double distribution is considered. Different observables constructed using this distribution are expected to be very effective to probe the anomalous coupling at a typical International Linear Collider machine. Further, suitable combinations of these observables could be used to disentangle the effect of contributions from different terms in the effective Lagrangian.</p>

				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>1251-1254</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>From inclusive measurements, it is known that about $7\%$ of all $B$ mesons decay into final states with baryons. In these decays, some striking features become visible compared to mesonic decays. The largest branching fractions come with quite moderate multiplicities of 3–4 hadrons. We note that two-body decays to baryons are suppressed relative to three- and four-body decays. In most of these analyses, the invariant baryon–antibaryon mass shows an enhancement near the threshold. We propose a phenomenological interpretation of this quite common feature of hadronization to baryons.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results of a model-independent analysis, which systematically scans the data taken by CMS for deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions. Due to the minimal theoretical bias, this approach is sensitive to a variety of models for new physics. Events with at least one electron or muon are classified according to their content of reconstructed objects (muons, electrons, photons, jets and missing transverse energy). A broad scan of three kinematic distributions in those classes is performed by identifying deviations from SM expectations, accounting for systematic uncertainties. In this particular search, no significant discrepancies have been observed in data taken by CMS in 2010 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 pb$^{−1}$.</p>

					<p>The top polarization at the International Linear Collider (ILC) with transverse beam polarization is utilized in the $e^{+} e^{-} \rightarrow t\bar{t}$ process to probe interactions of the scalar and tensor type beyond the Standard Model and to disentangle their individual contributions. Confidence level limits of $90\%$ are presented on the interactions with realistic integrated luminosity and are found to improve by an order of magnitude compared to the case when the spin of the top quark is not measured. Sensitivities of the order of a few times $10^{−3}$ TeV$^{−2}$ for real and imaginary parts of both scalar and tensor couplings at $\sqrt{s} = 500$ and 800 GeV with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{−1}$ and completely polarized beams are shown to be possible.</p>

					<p>The new physics (NP) is parametrized with four model-independent quantities: the magnitudes and phases of the dispersive part $M_{12}$ and the absorptive part $\Gamma_{12}$ of the NP contribution to the effective Hamiltonian. We constrain these parameters using the four observables $\Delta M_{\text{s}}$, $\Delta \Gamma_{\text{s}}$, the mixing phase $\beta_{\text{s}}^{J/\psi \phi}$ and $A_{\text{sl}}^{b}$. This formalism is extended to include charge-parity-time reversal (CPT) violation, and it is shown that CPT violation by itself, or even in the presence of CPTconserving NP without an absorptive part, helps only marginally in the simultaneous resolution of these anomalies.</p>

				<title>Triggering on hadronic tau decays: ATLAS meets the challenge</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>1309-1312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hadronic tau decays play a crucial role in taking Standard Model ({\bf SM}) measurements as well as in the search for physics beyond the {\bf SM}. However, hadronic tau decays are difficult to identify and trigger on due to their resemblance to {\bf QCD} jets. Given the large production crosssection of {\bf QCD} processes, designing and operating a trigger system to efficiently select hadronic tau decays, while maintaining the rate within the bandwidth limits, is a difficult challenge. This contribution will summarize the status and performance of the {\bf ATLAS} tau trigger system during the 2010–2011 data taking period. Different methods that have been explored to obtain the trigger efficiency curves from data will be shown. Finally, the status of the measurements, which include hadronic tau decays in the final state, will be summarized. In light of the vast statistics collected in 2011, future prospects for triggering on hadronic tau decays in this exciting new period of increased instantaneous luminosity will be presented.</p>

					<p>A search for the Standard Model ({\bf SM}) Higgs boson in the decay channel $H \rightarrow ZZ^{(∗)} \rightarrow 4l$ with each $Z$ boson decaying to an electron or muon pair is presented using $pp$ collisions from the {\bf LHC} at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of $1.66 \pm 0.07$ fb$^{−1}$ recorded by the {\bf CMS} detector in 2010 and 2011. The search covers Higgs boson mass $(m_{\text{H}})$ hypotheses of $110 &#60; m_{\text{H}} &#60; 600$ GeV/c$^{2}$. Twenty-one events are observed, while $21.2 \pm 0.8$ events are expected from Standard Model ({\bf SM}) background processes. The events are not clustered in mass excluding interpretation as the {\bf SM} Higgs boson and its $(4l)$ mass distribution is consistent with the expectation of {\bf SM} continuum production of $ZZ^{(∗)}$ pairs. Upper limits at $95\%$ {\bf CL} on the cross-section $\times$ branching ratio for a {\bf SM} Higgs boson with SM like decays exclude cross-sections from about once to twice the expected {\bf SM} cross-section for masses in the range of $150 &#60; m_{\text{H}}&#60; 420$ GeV/c$^{2}$.</p>

A much improved precision with respect to the previous {\bf ZEUS} publication, which used only 16.7 pb$^{−1}$ of electron–proton collisions and 65.1 pb$^{−1}$ of positron–proton collisions, is achieved, owing to the large data sample and improved kinematic reconstruction methods. The measurement is well-described by different theory predictions.</p>

				<title>Tau reconstruction, energy calibration and identification at ATLAS</title>
				<feature>Poster Presentations</feature>
				<page>1337-1340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tau leptons play a central role in the {\bf LHC} physics programme, in particular as an important signature in many Higgs boson and supersymmetry searches. They are further used in Standard Model electroweak measurements, as well as detector-related studies like the determination of the missing transverse energy scale. Copious backgrounds from {\bf QCD} processes call for both efficient identification of hadronically decaying tau leptons, as well as large suppression of fake candidates. A solid understanding of the combined performance of the calorimeter and tracking detectors is also required. We present the current status of the tau reconstruction, energy calibration and identification with the {\bf ATLAS} detector at the {\bf LHC}. Identification efficiencies are measured in $W \rightarrow \tau \nu$ events in data and compared with predictions from Monte Carlo simulations, whereas the misidentification probabilities of {\bf QCD} jets and electrons are determined from various jet-enriched data samples and from $Z \rightarrow ee$ events, respectively. The tau energy scale calibration is described and systematic uncertainties on both energy scale and identification efficiencies discussed.</p>

				<title>Quantitative assessment of target dependence of pion fluctuation in hadronic interactions – estimation through erraticity</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1395-1405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Event-to-event fluctuation pattern of pions produced by proton and pion beams is studied in terms of the newly defined erraticity measures $\chi (p, q)$, $\chi_{q}^{'} and $\mu_{q}^{'}$ proposed by Cao and Hwa. The analysis reveals the erratic behaviour of the produced pions signifying the chaotic multiparticle production in high-energy hadron–nucleus interactions ($\pi^{-}$ –AgBr interactions at 350 GeV/c and $p$–AgBr interactions at 400 GeV/c). However, the chaoticity does not depend on whether the projectile is proton or pion. The results are compared with the results of the {\bf VENUS}-generated data for the above interactions which suggests that {\bf VENUS} event generator is unable to reproduce the event-to-event fluctuations of spatial patterns of final states. A comparative study of $p$–AgBr interactions and $p– p$ collisions at 400 GeV/c from {\bf NA27}, with the help of a quantitative parameter for the assessment of pion fluctuation, indicates conclusively that particle production process is more chaotic for hadron–nucleus interactions than for hadron–hadron interactions.</p>

					<p>Using a unified description on multiplicity distributions of final-state particles, the transverse momentum distributions of identified particles produced in proton–proton $(pp)$, proton– and deuteron–nucleus $[p(d)A]$, and nucleus–nucleus $(AA)$ collisions at high energies are studied in this paper. We assume that the transverse momentum distributions of identified particles measured in final state are contributed by a few energy sources which can be regarded as partons or quarks in the interacting system. The particle is contributed by each source with gluons which have transverse momentum distributions in an exponential form. The modelling results are compared and found to be in agreement with the experimental data at high energies.</p>

				<title>Generation of tunable 16 $\mu$m radiation from CO$_{2}$ by cascade lasing</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1425-1441</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we propose a scheme to generate tunable 16 $\mu$m radiation from CO$_{2}$ molecules by cascade lasing. The stimulating 9.5 $\mu$m radiation is generated internally by the fast rotating mirror {\bf Q}-switching technique. The optical scheme proposed by us uses an intracavity prism to separate the 9.5 $\mu$m and the 16 $\mu$m beams. This facilitates independent tuning of the two beams if required. In the present configuration, only the 16 $\mu$m cavity is dispersive. The 9.5 $\mu$m beam grows spontaneously in a stable semiconfocal resonator. We have developed a theoretical model to simulate the proposed scheme. The model predicts the energy and power of 16 $\mu$m radiation. The calculated values are much higher than the previously obtained experimental values. The results point out the feasibility of developing a laser system based on the theoretical design parameters presented in this paper. Such laser systems can find application in uranium isotope separation studies.</p>

				<title>Influence of pseudorandom bit format on the direct modulation performance of semiconductor lasers</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1443-1456</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper investigates the direct gigabit modulation characteristics of semiconductor lasers using the return to zero ({\bf RZ}) and non-return to zero ({\bf NRZ}) formats. The modulation characteristics include the frequency chirp, eye diagram, and turn-on jitter ({\bf TOJ}). The differences in the relative contributions of the intrinsic noise of the laser and the pseudorandom bit-pattern effect to the modulation characteristics are presented. We introduce an approximate estimation to the transient properties that control the digital modulation performance, namely, the modulation bit rate and the minimum (setting) bit rate required to yield a modulated laser signal free from the bit pattern effect. The results showed that the frequency chirp increases with the increase of the modulation current under both {\bf RZ} and {\bf NRZ} formats, and decreases remarkably with the increase of the bias current. The chirp is higher under the {\bf RZ} modulation format than under the {\bf NRZ} format. When the modulation bit rate is higher than the setting bit rate of the relaxation oscillation, the laser exhibits enhanced {\bf TOJ} and the eye diagram is partially closed. {\bf TOJ} decreases with the increase of the bias and/or modulation current for both formats of modulation.</p>

					<p>The paper investigates the effects of heat transfer in {\bf MHD} flow of viscoelastic stratified fluid in porous medium on a parallel plate channel inclined at an angle $\theta$. A laminar convection flow for incompressible conducting fluid is considered. It is assumed that the plates are kept at different temperatures which decay with time. The partial differential equations governing the flow are solved by perturbation technique. Expressions for the velocity of fluid and particle phases, temperature field, Nusselt number, skin friction and flow flux are obtained within the channel. The effects of various parameters like stratification factor, magnetic field parameter, Prandtl number on temperature field, heat transfer, skin friction, flow flux, velocity for both the fluid and particle phases are displayed through graphs and discussed numerically.</p>

				<page>1471-1483</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main aim of the study of thin target foil–laser interaction experiments is to understand the physics of hydrodynamics of the foil acceleration, which is highly relevant to inertial confinement fusion ({\bf ICF}). This paper discusses a simple, inexpensive multiframe optical shadow-graphy diagnostics developed for dynamic imaging of high velocity laser-accelerated target foils of different thicknesses. The diagnostic has a spatial and temporal resolution of 12 $\mu$m and 500 ps respectively in the measurements. The target velocity is in the range of $10^{6} - 10^{7}$ cm/s. Hydrodynamic efficiency of such targets was measured by energy balance experiments together with the measurement of kinetic energy of the laser-driven targets. Effect of target foil thickness on the hydrodynamics of aluminum foils was studied for determining the optimum conditions for obtaining a directed kinetic energy transfer of the accelerated foil. The diagnostics has also been successfully used to study ablatively accelerated targets of other novel materials.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>1485-1493</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Hamiltonian of a quantum rod with an ellipsoidal boundary is given after a coordinate transformation that changes the ellipsoidal boundary into a spherical one. The properties of the quantum rods constituting the bridge between two-dimensional quantum wells, zero-dimensional quantum dots and one-dimensional quantum wires are explored theoretically using linear combination operator method. The first internal excited state energy, the excitation energy and the transition frequency between the first internal excited and the ground states of the strong-coupled impurity-bound polaron in the rod with Coulomb-bound potential, the transverse effective confinement length, the ellipsoid aspect ratio and the electron–phonon coupling strength are studied. It is found that the first internal excited state energy, the excitation energy and the transition frequency are increasing functions of the Coulomb-bound potential and the electron–phonon coupling strength, whereas they are decreasing functions of the ellipsoid aspect ratio and the transverse effective confinement length. These results can be attributed to the interesting quantum size confining effects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Roulin $\mathit{et}$ $\mathit{al}$ (1988), in one of their experimental papers, have presented a study of field-dependent entropy of high-purity YBa$_{2}$ Cu$_{3}$ O$_{7−\delta}$ (YBCO) as a function of oxygen deficiency. In order to explain their experimental results, we have used phenomenological GL-theory of anisotropic HTSCs in the London limit in line with of our earlier paper (Pattanaik $\mathit{et}$ $\mathit{al}$, Physica {\bf B405}, 3234 (2010)). Moreover, to account for the applicability of the theory at high field, we have incorporated the effect of vortex overlapping in the London theory done by Nanda (1995). Here, we have presented the variation of change in entropy ($\Delta$S) with magnetic field for different oxygen deficiencies $\delta = 0$, 0.04, and 0.06. On comparison, we found that our results are in good agreement with the experimental data of Roulin $\mathit{et}$ $\mathit{al}$ (1988). The variation of penetration depth ($\lambda$) and anisotropic ratio of effective masses ($\gamma$) with concentration is also presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The dyes (C450, C480 and C540) and their dye mixtures (C450:C540 and C480:C540) were doped in polymer matrices (solid). Their photophysical studies were recorded. These results were analysed by comparing them with the data of the dyes and the dye mixtures in monomer compositions (liquid). The absorption and fluorescence spectral profiles of the dyes in the polymer matrix were found to be identical to those in the monomer compositions. The effect of different donors on the energy transfer technique using C540 as acceptor, in polymer matrix and monomer compositions, was studied in detail. The results obtained for the energy transfer technique in two binary dye mixtures containing different donors but same acceptor, in solid and liquid media, were intercompared. The gain of the acceptor without donor and with different donors was determined experimentally. The gain coefficient in the polymer matrix (solid) was less than that in the monomer medium (liquid). Also, the gain of the acceptor C540 was found to be more when C450 was used as the donor compared to that when C480 was used as the donor. Using nitrogen laser, the photobleaching effect in the two binary dye-doped polymer rods (with different donors but same acceptor) was studied. It was observed that photobleaching of the acceptor C540 in the presence of C450 as donor is slower than that in the presence of C480 as donor.</p>

					<p>We report a simple, non-intrusive fibre-optic refractometer sensor for measuring the refractive index of liquid and optically transparent solid medium. Sensing principle of the proposed sensor is based on monitoring the back-reflected light signal through the second input port of a $2 \times 1$ single-mode fibre coupler when light signal from the output port is focussed at the interface of air and a liquid or solid medium and back-reflected exactly along the same path. Depending on the refractive index of the medium, the amount of back-reflected intensity would vary and in the present work we exploit this principle to measure the refractive index of an optically transparent medium. Variation of refractive index as small as 0.001 {\bf RIU} can be measured with our proposed sensor.</p>

Within the framework of Fano’s theory, continuum bound anisotropic dressed state formalism of atom–molecule quantum dynamics is presented. This formalism is applicable in photo- and magneto-associative strong-coupling regimes. The significance of Fano effect in ultracold atom–molecule transitions is discussed. Quantum effects at low-energy atom–molecule interface are important for exploring coherent phenomena in hitherto unexplored parameter regimes.</p>

				<page>0061-0068</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we have obtained the solution of the unpolarized coupled Dokshitzer–Gribove–Lipatov–Alterelli–Parisi ({\bf DGLAP}) evolution equation in leading order at the small-$x$ limit. Here, we have used a Taylor series expansion, separation of functions and then the method of characteristics to solve the evolution equations. We have also calculated $t$-evolution of singlet and gluon distribution functions and the results are compared with {\bf E665} and {\bf NNPDF} data for singlet structure function and {\bf GRV1998} and {\bf MRST2004} gluon parametrizations. It is shown that our results are in good agreement with the parametrizations especially at small-x and high-$Q^{2}$ region. From global parametrizations and our results, we have seen that the singlet and gluon distribution functions increase when $Q^{2}$ increases for fixed values of $x$.</p>

				<title>Candidate of the member of three-phonon multiplet observed in the $\beta^{+}$ $+$EC decay of $^{76}$Br</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0069-0080</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The decay scheme of $^{76}$Br is established by the $^{76}$Br($T1/2 = 16.2$ h) $\bate^{+}$/EC study. The 1791.31 keV level, which was identified initially by Müller $\mathit{et al}$ with $^{76}$Se($p, p'$) reaction more than three decades ago, is reconfirmed. However, the spin and parity have not been assigned by Müller $\mathit{et al}$. Now we consider it reasonable to assign the 1791.31 keV level as a new candidate of the three-phonon multiplet in $^{76}$Se. In addition, in order to study the deformation of $^{76}$Se which lies in transitional region between strongly deformed and spherical nuclei, we calculate the total Routhian surfaces ({\bf TRS}) of positive-parity states by cranking shell model formalism.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The energy costs in the cold ternary fission of $^{252}$Cf for various light charged particle emission are calculated by includingWong's correction for Coulomb potential. Energy cost is found to be higher in cold fission than in normal fission. It is found that energy cost always increases with decrease in experimental yield in all the light charged particle emissions. The higher ground state deformation of the fragments, the odd–even effect and the enhanced yield in the octupole region observed in cold fission are found to be consistent with the concept of energy cost.</p>

				<title>Thermal-hydraulic analysis of LBE spallation target for accelerator-driven systems</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0089-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In an accelerator-driven subcritical system ({\bf ADS}), a high-performance spallation neutron source is used to feed the subcritical reactor. Neutron generation depends on the proton beam intensity. If the beam intensity is increased by a given factor, the number of generated neutrons will increase. The mechanism yielding a high rate of neutron production per energy is the spallation process, and this mechanism produces very high-energy deposition in the spallation target material. Producing a high rate of neutrons is accompanied by creation of problems of decay heat cooling and radiological protection. As a first step in designing a full-scale industrial {\bf ADS}, a small-scale experimental {\bf ADS}, which is similar to the European experimental {\bf ADS (XADS)} is analysed. The analysis presented in this paper is based on lead–bismuth eutectic ({\bf LBE}) cooled XADS-type experimental reactors, designed during the European experimental ({\bf PDS-XADS}) project. Computational fluid dynamics analysis has been carried out for the spallation target. Steady-state behaviour and shear stress transport turbulence model with the automatic wall treatment were applied in the present analysis.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0105-0120</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The small reactor design for the remote and less developed areas of the user countries should have simple features in view of the lack of infra-structure and resources. Many researchers consider long core life with no on-site refuelling activity as a primary feature for the small reactor design. Long core life can be achieved by enhancing internal conversion rate of fertile to fissile materials. For that purpose, thorium cycle can be adopted because a high fissile production rate of $^{233}$U converted from $^{232}$Th can be expected in the thermal energy region. A simple nuclear reactor core arranged 19 assemblies in hexagonal structure, using thorium-based fuel and heavy water as coolant and moderator was simulated using {\bf MCNPX2.6} code, aiming an optimized critical assembly. Optimized reflector thickness and gap between assemblies were determined to achieve minimum neutron leakage and void reactivity. The result was a more compact core, where assemblies were designed having 19-fuel pins in 1.25 pitch-to-diameter ratio. Optimum reflector thickness of 15 cm resulted in minimal neutron leakage in view of economic limitations. A 0.5 cm gap between assembles achieved more safety and $2.2\%$ enrichment requirements. The present feasibility study suggests a thermal core of acceptable neutronic parameters to achieve a simple and safe core.</p>

				<title>Antenna coupling study for ICWC plasma characterization in TEXTOR</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0121-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ion cyclotron wall conditioning ({\bf ICWC}) discharges, in pulsed-mode operation, were carried out in the limiter tokamak {\bf TEXTOR} to explore safe operational regimes for the experimental parameters for possible {\bf ICWC}-discharge cleaning in International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ({\bf ITER}) at half field. Antenna coupling properties obtained during the ion cyclotron range of frequencies ({\bf ICRF}) wall conditioning experiments performed in helium–hydrogen mixture in {\bf TEXTOR} were analysed in relation to the obtained {\bf ICWC}-plasma characterization results. Satisfactory antenna coupling in the mode conversion scenario along with reproducible generation of {\bf ICRF} plasmas for wall conditioning, were achieved by coupling radio frequency ({\bf RF}) power from one or two {\bf ICRF} antennas. The plasma breakdown results obtained in the {\bf TEXTOR} tokamak have been compared with the predictions of a zero-dimensional {\bf RF} plasma production model. The present study of {\bf ICWC} emphasizes the beneficial effect of application of an additional (along with toroidal magnetic field) stationary vertical ($B_{V} \ll B_{T}$) or oscillating poloidal magnetic field ($B_{P} \ll B_{T}$) on antenna coupling and relevant plasma parameters.</p>

				<title>Influence of argon plasma treatment on polyethersulphone surface</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0133-0141</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Polyethersulphone ({\bf PES}) was modified to improve the hydrophilicity of its surface, which in turn helps in improving its adhesive property. The modified {\bf PES} surface was characterized by contact angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({\bf XPS}), atomic force microscopy ({\bf AFM}) and Vicker’s microhardness measurement. The contact angles of the modified {\bf PES} reduces from $49^{\circ}$ to $10^{\circ}$ for water. The surface free energy ({\bf SFE}) calculated from measured contact angles increases from 66.3 to 79.5 mJ/m$^{2}$ with the increase in plasma treatment time. The increase in {\bf SFE} after plasma treatment is attributed to the functionalization of the polymer surface with hydrophilic groups. The {\bf XPS} analysis shows that the ratio of {\bf O/C} increases from 0.177 to 0.277 for modified {\bf PES} polymer. {\bf AFM} shows that the average surface roughness increases from 6.9 nm to 23.7 nm due to the increase in plasma treatment time. The microhardness of the film also increases with plasma treatment.</p>

				<title>A model for the occurrence and analysis of ionic thermocurrent spectrum involving different orders of kinetics</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0143-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ionic thermocurrent ({\bf ITC}) spectrum is much similar to a thermoluminescence ({\bf TL}) glow curve involving monomolecular kinetics. It has already been reported that different orders of kinetics are involved in {\bf TL} processes, which depend specifically on the extent of recombination and simultaneous retrapping. It is found that the involvement of different orders of kinetics in {\bf ITC} spectrum depends on the experimental conditions of polarization and rate of rapid cooling. Consequently, order of kinetics involved in the {\bf ITC} spectrum does not represent any specific feature of the system under investigation. An equation is developed which explains the occurrence of {\bf ITC} spectrum involving any order of kinetics. Dielectric relaxation parameters, order of kinetics and approximate number of dipoles per unit volume are evaluated conveniently and easily following the proposed model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of the present work is to make a comparative study of the {\bf EXAFS} spectra recorded at the BL-8 dispersive {\bf EXAFS} beamline at 2 GeV Indus-2 synchrotron source at {\bf RRCAT}, Indore (India) with those recorded at other synchrotron {\bf EXAFS} beamlines, viz., {\bf X-19A} at {\bf NSLS}, {\bf BNL (USA)}, {\bf EXAFS} wiggler beamline 4-1 at the {\bf SSRL} ({\bf USA}) and beamline 11.1 at {\bf ELETTRA} (Italy). For this purpose, {\bf EXAFS} spectra at Cu K-edge in copper metal have been recorded at these four beamlines. Further, {\bf EXAFS} spectra at Cu K-edge in a copper complex have also been recorded at BL-8 beamline and beamline 11.1 at {\bf ELETTRA} (Italy). The obtained experimental $\mu(E)$ data have been background-subtracted and then normalized. The normalized data have been then converted to $\chi(k)$ data, which have been Fourier-transformed and then fitted with the theoretical model, thereby yielding different structural parameters. It has been shown that the results obtained from the {\bf EXAFS} spectra recorded at the {\bf BL-8} beamline are comparable with those obtained from other synchrotron {\bf EXAFS} beamlines and also with the crystallographic results reported by earlier workers. The reliability, usefulness and data quality of the {\bf BL-8} beamline have been discussed.</p>

					<p>Community detection is of considerable importance for understanding both the structure and function of complex networks. In this paper, we introduced the general procedure of the community detection algorithms using global and local structural information, where the edge betweenness and the local similarity measures respectively based on local random walk dynamics and local cyclic structures were used. The algorithms were tested on artificial and real-world networks. The results clearly show that all the algorithms have excellent performance in the tests and the local similarity measure based on local random walk dynamics is superior to that based on local cyclic structures.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0207-0222</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Based on trajectory-dependent path probability formalism in state space, we derive generalized entropy production fluctuation relations for a quantum system in the presence of measurement and feedback. We have obtained these results for three different cases: (i) the system is evolving in isolation from its surroundings; (ii) the system being weakly coupled to a heat bath; and (iii) system in contact with reservoir using quantum Crooks fluctuation theorem. In Case (iii), we build on the treatment carried out by {\bf H T Quan} and {\bf H Dong} [arXiv/cond-mat:0812.4955], where a quantum trajectory has been defined as a sequence of alternating work and heat steps. The obtained entropy production fluctuation theorems ({\bf FT}s) retain the same form as in the classical case. The inequality of second law of thermodynamics gets modified in the presence of information. These {\bf FT}s are robust against intermediate measurements of any observable performed with respect to von Neumann projective measurements as well as weak or positive operator-valued measurements.</p>

				<title>Complete switched modified function projective synchronization of a five-term chaotic system with uncertain parameters and disturbances</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0223-0235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A five-term three-dimensional ({\bf 3D}) autonomous chaotic system with an exponential nonlinear term is reported in this paper. Basic dynamical behaviours of the chaotic system are further investigated. Then a new synchronization phenomenon, complete switched modified function projective synchronization ({\bf CSMFPS}), for this novel five-term chaotic system with uncertain parameters and disturbances is investigated. This paper extends previous work, where {\bf CSMFPS} of chaotic systems means that all the state variables of the drive system synchronize with different state variables of the response system. As the synchronization scheme has many combined forms, it is a promising type of synchronization and can provide greater security in secure communication. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, a robust adaptive controller is contrived to acquire {\bf CSMFPS}, parameter identification and suppress disturbances simultaneously. Finally, the Lorenz system and the new five-term chaotic system are taken as examples and the corresponding numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control scheme.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0263-0275</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presents the measurement, analysis and correction of closed orbit distortion ({\bf COD}) in Indus-2 at 550 MeV injection energy and 2 GeV synchrotron radiation user run energy. The measured {\bf COD} was analysed and fitted to understand major sources of errors in terms of the effective quadrupole misalignments. The rms {\bf COD} was corrected down to less than 0.6 mm in both horizontal and vertical planes. A golden orbit was set for the operating synchrotron radiation beamlines. With {\bf COD} correction, the injection efficiency at 550 MeV was improved by $\sim 50\%$ and the beam lifetime at 2 GeV was increased by $\sim8$ h. In this paper, the method of global {\bf COD} correction based on singular value decomposition ({\bf SVD}) of the orbit response matrix is described. Results for the {\bf COD} correction in both horizontal and vertical planes at 550 MeV injection energy and at 2 GeV synchrotron radiation user run energy are discussed.</p>

					<p>Transport of high current ($\sim$kA range with particle energy $\sim 1$ MeV) planar electron beams is a topic of increasing interest for applications in high-power (1–10 GW) and high-frequency (10–20 GHz) microwave devices such as backward wave oscillator ({\bf BWO}), klystrons, gyro-{\bf BWO}s, etc. In this paper, we give a simulated result for transport of electron beams with velocity  $V_{b} = 5.23 \times 10^{8}$ cm s$^{−1}$ , relativistic factor $\gamma = 1.16$, and beam voltage = $\sim$80 kV in notched wiggler magnet array. The calculation includes self-consistent effects of beam-generated fields. Our results show that the notched wiggler configuration with $\sim$6.97 kG magnetic field strength can provide vertical and horizontal confinements for a sheet electron beam with 0.3 cm thickness and 2 cm width. The feasibility calculation addresses to a system expected to drive for 13–20 GHz {\bf BWO} with rippled waveguide parameters as width $w = 3.0$ cm, thickness $t = 1.0$ cm, corrugation depth $h = 0.225$ cm, and spatial periodicity $d = 1.67$ cm.</p>

				<page>0295-0306</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Arbitrary amplitude dust-acoustic ({\bf DA}) solitary waves in an unmagnetized and collisionless quantum dusty plasma comprising cold dust particles, kappa ($\kappa$)-distributed ions and degenerate electrons are investigated. The influence of suprathermality and quantum effects on the linear dispersion relation of {\bf DA} waves is investigated. Then, the effect of $\kappa$-distributed ions and degenerate electrons on the existence domain of solitons is discussed in the space of ($M, f$). The comparison of the existence domain for higher and lower values of $\kappa$ shows that suprathermality results in propagation of solitons with lower values of Mach number, and the quantum effects, lead to a higher values of Mach number. The existence domain of solitons for nondegenerate $\kappa$-distributed electrons is considered for comparison with effect of degenerate electrons. Also, we found that the Sagdeev potential well becomes deeper and wider as $\varepsilon_{F-i}$ decreases, as for lower $\kappa$ values, the influence of quantum effects on the Sagdeev pseudopotential profile is smaller.</p>

					<p>{\textit{Ab initio}} detailed calculations of the elastic properties of AgCl$_{x} Br$_{1−x}$ alloys were recently made using density-functional perturbation theory and by employing the virtual crystal approximation or by means of the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method. Here, we suggest a simple theoretical model that enables estimation of isothermal compressibility of these alloys in terms of the elastic data of end-members alone. The calculated values are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental ones. The present model makes use of an early suggestion that interconnects Gibbs energy for the formation and/or migration of defects in solids with bulk properties.</p>

				<title>Effect of Al doping on microstructure and optical band gap of ZnO thin film synthesized by successive ion layer adsorption and reaction</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0315-0326</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thin films of pure and aluminum-doped zinc oxide ({\bf AZO}) were deposited on glass substrates from ammonium zincate bath following a chemical dipping technique called successive ion layer adsorption and reaction ({\bf SILAR}). Characterization techniques such as {\bf X-ray} diffraction ({\bf XRD}), scanning electron microscopy ({\bf SEM}) and energy-dispersive X-rays ({\bf EDX}) were used to investigate the effect of Al doping on the microstructure of {\bf AZO} films. Particle size analysis using {\bf X-ray} line broadening shows marginally increasing trend with increasing Al impurity. The average particle size for pure {\bf ZnO} is 22.75 nm. It increases to 24.26 nm for $1\%$ {\bf AZO} film and 25.13 nm for $2\%$ {\bf AZO} film. Incorporation of Al was confirmed from elemental analysis using {\bf EDX. SEM} micrograph shows that pure {\bf ZnO} particles are spherical shaped. However, {\bf AZO} films show particles with off-spherical shape with compact interconnected grains. The value of band gap for pure {\bf ZnO} is 3.229 eV and it increases to 3.29 eV for $1\%$ {\bf AZO} indicating a blue-shift for $1\%$ {\bf AZO} film. However, for $2\%$ {\bf AZO} film, a decrease in band gap compared to pure {\bf ZnO} is observed indicating a red-shift of fundamental absorption edge. Electrical resistance shows an initial decrease with increasing Al content. With further enhancement of Al incorporation, the resistance increases.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0327-0336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coherent spin-dependent electron transport is investigated in three conditions: (1) a C$_{60}$ molecule is connected to two ferromagnetic ({\bf FM}) electrodes symmetrically, (2) a C$_{59}$N molecule is connected to two {\bf FM} electrodes symmetrically and (3) a C$_{59}$N molecule is connected to two {\bf FM} electrodes asymmetrically. This work is based on a single-band tight-binding model Hamiltonian and the Green’s function approach with the Landauer–Buttiker formalism. Electrodes used in this study are semi-infinite {\bf FM} electrodes with finite cross-section. Obvious rectification effect is observed in the C$_{59}$ N molecule which is connected to the {\bf FM} electrodes asymmetrically. This effect is more in the P alignment of {\bf FM} electrodes than in {\bf AP} alignment of {\bf FM} electrodes. This study indicates that the rectification behaviour is due to the asymmetry in molecule and junctions. Also in this investigation tunnel magnetoresistance ({\bf TMR}) is calculated for these molecules. Asymmetry is observed in {\bf TMR} of C$_{59}$N which is coupled to the electrodes asymmetrically due to asymmetric junctions, but {\bf TMR} of C$_{60}$ is symmetric.</p>

This work aims at studying the structure and function of {\textit{Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)}} metabolic network by complex network methods. We first generated a metabolite graph from the recently reconstructed high-quality {\textit{S. aureus}} metabolic network model. Then, based on `bow tie' structure character, we explain and discuss the global structure of {\textit{S. aureus}} metabolic network. The functional significance, global structural properties, modularity and centrality analysis of giant strong component in {\textit{S. aureus}} metabolic networks are studied.</p>

				<title>The Standard Model with one universal extra dimension</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0369-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effects of universal extra dimensions on Standard Model observables first arise at the one-loop level. The quantization of this class of theories is therefore essential in order to perform predictions. A comprehensive study of the $SU_{C}(3) \times SU_{L}(2) \times U_{Y}(1)$ Standard Model defined in a space-time manifold with one universal extra dimension, compactified on the oribifold $S^{1}/Z_{2}$, is presented. The fact that the four-dimensional Kaluza–Klein theory is subjected to two types of gauge transformations is stressed and its quantization under the basis of the {\bf BRST} symmetry discussed. $A SU_{C}(3) \times SU_{L}(2) \times U_{Y}(1)$-covariant gauge-fixing procedure for the Kaluza–Klein excitations is introduced. The connection between gauge and mass eigenstate fields is established in an exact way. An exhaustive list of the explicit expressions for all physical couplings induced by the Yang–Mills, Currents, Higgs, and Yukawa sectors is presented. The one-loop renormalizability of the standard Green’s functions, which implies that the Standard Model observables do not depend on a cut-off scale, is stressed.</p>

To show this, the least set of assumptions about the formalism and the interpretation of non-relativistic quantum theory is considered.

This result may be useful in the investigation of the possible clustering of dark energy. All the examples dealt with have apparent horizons formed before the formation of singularity. The singularities formed are shell focussing in nature. The density of the scalar field distribution is seen to diverge at singularity. The Ricci scalar also diverges at the singularity. The interior spherically symmetric metric is matched with exterior Vaidya metric at the hypersurface and the appropriate junction conditions are obtained.</p>

					<p>There is a strong need for the optimized management of the thermal problem in {\bf Nd:YAG} laser rod and for a powerful, fast, and accurate modelling tool capable of treating the heat source distribution very close to what it actually is. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm called bacterial foraging optimization algorithm ({\bf BFOA}) is proposed for simulation of the radial heat distribution. {\bf A BFOA} discloses a simulation method which delivers the exact temperature distribution in a circularly cylindrical structure with a circularly symmetrical, longitudinally, and transversally non-uniform heat source distribution and circularly symmetrical cooling means. The output power is obtained and compared with previously published experimental measurements for different pump power and a good agreement has been found.</p>

				<page>0507-0517</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, atmospheric pressure glow discharges ({\bf APGD}) in argon generated in parallel plate dielectric barrier discharge system is investigated by means of electrical and optical measurements. Using a high voltage (0–20 kV) power supply operating at 10–30 kHz, homogeneous and steady {\bf APGD} has been observed between the electrodes with gap spacing from 0.5 mm to 2 mm and with a dielectric barrier of thickness 2 mm while argon gas is fed at a controlled flow rate of 11/min. The electron temperature and electron density of the plasma are determined by means of optical emission spectroscopy. Our results show that the electron density of the discharge obtained is of the order of 10$^{16}$ cm$^{−3}$ while the electron temperature is estimated to be 0.65 eV. The important result is that electron density determined from the line intensity ratio method and stark broadening method are in very good agreement. The Lissajous figure is used to estimate the energy deposited to the glow discharge. It is found that the energy deposited to the discharge is in the range of 20 to 25 $\\mu$J with a discharge voltage of 1.85 kV. The energy deposited to the discharge is observed to be higher at smaller gas spacing. The glow discharge plasma is tested to be effective in reducing the hydrophobicity of polyethylene film significantly.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we study the head-on collision between two dust-ion-acoustic ({\bf DIA}) solitons in quantum electron-dust-ion plasma. Using the extended Poincaré–Lighthill–Kuo ({\bf PLK}) method, we obtain the Korteweg–de Vries ({\bf KdV}) equations, the phase shifts and the trajectories after the head-on collision of the two {\bf DIA} solitons. We investigate the effect of quantum diffraction parameters for electrons and ions $(H_{e}, H_{i})$, the Fermi temperature ratio $(\sigma)$ and the dust charged number density $(n_{\text{d0}})$ on the phase shifts. Different values of $\mu = z_{\text{d0}}(n_{\text{d0}}/n_{\text{i0}})$ and $\mu_{\text{d}} = z_{\text{d0}}(m_{\text{i}}/m_{\text{d}})$ are taken to discuss the effects on phase shifts, where $z_{\text{d0}}$ denotes the dust charge number, $n_{\text{j0}}$represents the equilibrium number density and $m_{j}$ is the mass of the jth species ($j = e, i , d$ for electrons, ions and dust particles, respectively).

				<title>On the sharp front-type solution of the Nagumo equation with nonlinear diffusion and convection</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0533-0538</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper is concerned with the Nagumo equation with nonlinear degenerate diffusion and convection which arises in several problems of population dynamics, chemical reactions and others. A sharp front-type solution with a minimum speed to this model equation is analysed using different methods. One of the methods is to solve the travelling wave equations and compute an exact solution which describes the sharp travelling wavefront. The second method is to solve numerically an initial-moving boundary-value problem for the partial differential equation and obtain an approximation for this sharp front-type solution.</p>

				<title>Real gauge singlet scalar extension of the Standard Model: A possible candidate for cold dark matter</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0539-0557</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The simplest extension of Standard Model ({\bf SM}) is considered in which a real {\bf SM} gauge singlet scalar with an additional discrete symmetry $Z_{2}$ is introduced to {\bf SM}. This additional scalar can be a viable candidate of cold dark matter ({\bf CDM}) since the stability of $S$ is achieved by the application of $Z_{2}$ symmetry on $S$. Considering $S$ as a possible candidate of {\bf CDM}, Boltzmann’s equation is solved to find the freeze-out temperature and relic density of $S$ for Higgs mass 120 GeV in the scalar mass range 5 GeV to 1 TeV. As {\bf HHSS} coupling $\delta_{2}$ appearing in Lagrangian depends upon the value of scalar mass $m_{S}$ and Higgs mass $m_{h}$, the $m_{S} − \delta_{2}$ parameter space has been constrained by using the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ({\bf WMAP}) limit on the relic density of {\bf DM} in the Universe and the results of recent ongoing {\bf DM} direct search experiments, namely {\bf CDMS-II, CoGeNT, DAMA, EDELWEISS-II, XENON-10 and XENON-100.} From such analyses, two distinct mass regions are found (a lower and higher mass domain) for such a {\bf DM} candidate that satisfy both the {\bf WMAP} limit and the experimental results considered here. The possible differential direct detection rates and annual variation of total detection rates have been estimated for this scalar {\bf DM} candidate $S$ for two detector materials, namely {\bf Ge} and {\bf Xe}. Finally, the $\gamma$-ray flux has been calculated from the galactic centre due to annihilation of two 130 GeV scalar {\bf DM} into two monoenergetic $\gamma$-rays.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we derive Lie point, generalized, master and time-dependent symmetries of a dispersionless equation, which is an extension of a classical long wave system. This equation also admits an infinite-dimensional Lie algebraic structure of Virasoro-type, as in the dispersive integrable systems. We discuss the construction of a sequence of negative ranking symmetries through the property of uniformity in rank. More interestingly, we obtain the conserved quantities directly from the casimir of Poisson pencil.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>It is proved that the maximum eigenvalue sequence of the principal submatrices of coupling matrix is decreasing. The method of calculating the number of pinning nodes is given based on this theory. The findings reveal the relationship between the decreasing speed of maximum eigenvalue sequence of the principal submatrices for coupling matrix and the synchronizability on complex networks via pinning control. We discuss the synchronizability on some networks, such as scale-free networks and small-world networks. Numerical simulations show that different pinning strategies have different pinning synchronizability on the same complex network, and the synchronizability with pinning control is consistent with one without pinning control in various complex networks.</p>

Nuclear photographic emulsion technique has been employed to collect the experimental data. The presence of such substructures, their average behaviour, their size, and their position of occurrence have been examined. The experimental results have also been compared with the results simulated by Monte-Carlo method. The analysis strongly indicates the presence of ring- and jet-like structures in the experimental distributions of particles beyond statistical noise.

				<title>Collision and recombination driven instabilities in variable charged dusty plasmas</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0643-0664</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dust-acoustic instability driven by recombination of electrons and ions on the surface of charged and variably-charged dust grains as well as by collisions in dusty plasmas with significant pressure of background neutrals have been theoretically investigated. The recombination driven instability is shown to be dominant in the long wavelength regime even in the presence of dust-neutral and ion-neutral collisions, while in the shorter wavelength regime, the dust-neutral collision is found to play a major role. In an earlier research work, the dust-neutral collision was neglected in comparison to the effect due to the recombination for estimating the dust-acoustic instability; later the other report shows that the recombination effect is negligible in the presence of dust-neutral collisions. In line of this present situation our investigation revealed that the recombination is more important than dust-neutral collisions in laboratory plasma and fusion plasma, while the dust-neutral collision frequency is dominant in the interstellar plasmas. The effects of ion and dust densities and ion streaming on the recombination and collision driven mode in parameter regimes relevant for many experimental studies on dusty plasmas have also been calculated.</p>

The well-known reductive perturbation method is employed to derive the {\bf MG} equation. The basic features of nonplanar {\bf DA} Gardner solitons ({\bf GSs}) are discussed. It is seen that the properties of nonplanar {\bf DAGSs} (positive and negative) significantly differ as the value of spectral index $\kappa$ changes.</p>

In this case the effect of strong static magnetic field is considered. The problem of strong magnetic field is solved in {\bf 1D} nonuniform plane plasma waveguide. The equation describing the spatial part of the electric potential is obtained. Also, the growth rates and conditions of the parametric instability for periodic and aperiodic cases are obtained. It is found that the spatial nonuniformity of the plasma exerts a stabilizing effect on the {\bf API}. It is shown that the growth rates of periodic and aperiodic {\bf API} in nonuniform plasma are less compared to that of uniform plasma.</p>

				<title>Arc plasma devices: Evolving mechanical design from numerical simulation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0685-0699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wide ranges of technological applications involve arc plasma devices as the primary plasma source for processing work. Recent findings exhibit the existence of appreciable thermal non-equilibrium in these so-called thermal plasma devices. Commercially available magnetohydrodynamic codes are not capable of handling such systems due to unavailability of non-equilibrium thermodynamic and transport property data and self-consistent models. A recipe for obtaining mechanical design of arc plasma devices from numerical simulation incorporating two-temperature thermal non-equilibrium model is presented in this article with reference to the plasma of the mixture of molecular gases like nitrogen and oxygen. Such systems are technologically important as they correspond to the plasma devices operating with air, oxygen plasma torches in cutting industries and plasma devices using nitrogen as shielding gas. Temperature field, associated fluid dynamics and electrical characteristics of a plasma torch are computed in a systematic manner to evaluate the performance of a conceived design using a two-fluid {\bf CFD} model coupled with a two-temperature thermodynamic and transport property code. Important effects of different nozzle designs and plasma gases obtained from the formalism are discussed. Non-equilibrium thermo-dynamic properties are computed using modified two-temperature Saha equations and transport properties are computed using standard Chapman–Enskog approach.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the effect of electromagnetic field in the string Bianchi type-VI$_{0}$ Universe is investigated. Einstein’s field equations have been solved exactly with suitable physical assumptions for two types of strings: (i) massive strings and (ii) Nambu strings. It is found that when the Universe is dominated by massive strings, the existence of electromagnetic field is necessary as it accelerates the expansion of the Universe. But when our Universe is dominated by Nambu strings, the electromagnetic field does not have significant effect on the evolution of the Universe. We have also shown that the early massive string-dominated Universe got converted to Nambu string-dominated Universe later. Our models are derived from an early deceleration phase to an accelerating phase which is consistent with the recent observations of supernovae type-Ia. The physical and geometrical behaviour of these models are also discussed.</p>

So, finding exact travelling wave solutions of such equations are very helpful in the theories and numerical studies. In this paper, the Kudryashov method is used to seek exact travelling wave solutions of such physical models. Further, three-dimensional plots of some of the solutions are also given to visualize the dynamics of the equations.

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0785-0796</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper the time evolution of von Neumann entropy, as a measure of entanglement between V-type three-level atoms and the union of a two-mode field, is studied. The atom–field interaction is assumed to occur in a Kerr-type medium with an intensity-dependent coupling. Introducing a Casmir operator whose eigenvalues, $N$, give total excitations in the system and commutes with the governing Hamiltonian, it is concluded that the latter is block-diagonal with ever growing dimensions. As we shall show, however, each block consists of two $2 \times 2$ blocks while all the others, $(N −1)$ in number, are $3 \times 3$. We then proceed to analytically calculate the time-evolution operator which is also block-diagonal, each block with the same properties as that of the Hamiltonian. Our calculations show that, as expected, the atom–field entanglement oscillates which, depending upon the initial state, exhibits the phenomenon of collapse revivals. It is further shown that collapse revivals occur whenever both $2 \times 2$ blocks are involved in the time evolution of the system. Properties of such behaviour in the entanglement are also discussed in detail.</p>

				<title>Confinement, average forces, and the Ehrenfest theorem for a one-dimensional particle</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0797-0810</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The topics of confinement, average forces, and the Ehrenfest theorem are examined for a particle in one spatial dimension. Two specific cases are considered: (i) A free particle moving on the entire real line, which is then permanently confined to a line segment or `a box' (this situation is achieved by taking the limit $V_{0} \rightarrow \infty$ in a finite well potential). This case is called `a particle-in-an-infinite-square-well-potential'. (ii) A free particle that has always been moving inside a box (in this case, an external potential is not necessary to confine the particle, only boundary conditions). This case is called `a particle-in-a-box'. After developing some basic results for the problem of a particle in a finite square well potential, the limiting procedure that allows us to obtain the average force of the infinite square well potential from the finite well potential problem is re-examined in detail. A general expression is derived for the mean value of the external classical force operator for a particle-in-an-infinite-square-well-potential, $\hat{F}$. After calculating similar general expressions for the mean value of the position ($\hat{X}$) and momentum ($\hat{P}$) operators, the Ehrenfest theorem for a particle-in-an-infinite-square-well-potential (i.e., $d\langle \hat{X} \rangle /dt = \langle \hat{P} \rangle /M$ and $d\langle \hat{P} \rangle /dt = \langle \hat{F} \rangle$) is proven. The formal time derivatives of the mean value of the position ($\hat{x}$) and momentum ($\hat{p}$) operators for a particle-in-a-box are re-introduced. It is verified that these derivatives present terms that are evaluated at the ends of the box. Specifically, for the wave functions satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition, the results, $d\langle \hat{x} \rangle /dt = \langle \hat{p} \rangle /M$ and $d\langle \hat{p} \rangle /dt = b.t. + \langle \hat{f} \rangle$, are obtained where b.t. denotes a boundary term and $\hat{f}$ is the external classical force operator for the particle-in-a-box. Thus, it appears that the expected Ehrenfest theorem is not entirely verified. However, by considering a normalized complex general state that is a combination of energy eigen-states to the Hamiltonian describing a particle-in-a-box with $\nu(x) = 0(\Rightarrow \hat{f} = 0)$, the result that the b.t. is equal to the mean value of the external classical force operator for the particle-in-an-infinite-square-well-potential is obtained, i.e., $d\langle \hat{p} \rangle /dt$ is equal to $\langle \hat{F} \rangle$. Moreover, the b.t. is written as the mean value of a quantity that is called boundary quantum force, $f_{B}$. Thus, the Ehrenfest theorem for a particle-in-a-box can be completed with the formula $d\langle \hat{p} \rangle /dt = \langle f_{B} \rangle$.</p>

Using space-time algebra, the most generalized form of gravitoelectromagnetic Klein–Gordon equation has been obtained. Finally, the analogy in formulation between massive gravitational theory and electromagnetism has been discussed.</p>

				<title>Comparison of backstepping and modified active control in projective synchronization of chaos in an extended Bonhöffer–van der Pol oscillator</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0825-0835</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, projective synchronization of double–scroll attractor of an extended Bonöffer–van der Pol oscillator ({\bf BVPO}) is considered via the backstepping and active control techniques. In each synchronization scheme, a single control function is designed to achieve projective synchronization between two Bonhöffer–van der Pol oscillator evolving from different initial conditions. To obtain a single control function via the active control, the coefficient of the error dynamics is chosen such that the number of control functions is reduced from three to one, thereby, reducing control function complexity in design. The results show that the transient error dynamics convergence and synchronization time are achieved faster via the backstepping than that of the active control technique. However, the control function obtained via the active control is simpler with a more stable synchronization time and hence, it is more suitable for practical implementation. Numerical simulations are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the analytical results.</p>

				<title>Investigation of the zenith angle dependence of cosmic-ray muons at sea level</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0837-0846</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Angular distribution of cosmic-ray muons at sea level has been investigated using the Geant4 simulation package. The model used in the simulations was tested by comparing the simulation results with the measurements made using the Berkeley Lab cosmic ray detector. Primary particles’ energy and fluxes were obtained from the experimental measurements. Simulations were run at each zenith angle starting from $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ up to $\theta = 70^{\circ}$ with $5^{\circ}$ increment. The angular distribution of muons at sea level has been estimated to be in the form $I(\theta) = I(0^{\circ}) \cos^{n}(\theta)$, where $I(0^{\circ})$ is the muon intensity at $0^{\circ}$ and $n$ is a function of the muon momentum. The exponent $n = 1.95 \pm 0.08$ for muons with energies above 1 GeV is in good agreement, within error, with the values reported in the literature.</p>

					<p>In this paper, the beam lifetime measurement and its theoretical analysis are presented using measured vacuum pressure and applied radio frequency ({\bf RF}) cavity voltage in Indus-2 electron storage ring at 2 GeV beam energy. Experimental studies of the effect of {\bf RF} cavity voltage and bunched beam filling pattern on beam lifetime are also presented. An equation of stable beam current decay is evolved and this equation closely follows the observed beam current decay pattern. It shows that the beam is stable and the beam current decay is due to the beam–residual gas interaction (vacuum lifetime) and electron–electron interaction within a bunch (Touschek lifetime). The estimated vacuum, Touschek and total beam lifetimes from analytical formulations are also compared with the measured beam lifetime.</p>

					<p>The term `thermal flux' implies a Maxwellian distribution of velocity and energy corresponding to the most probable velocity of 2200 ms$^{−1}$ at 293.4 K. In order to measure the thermal neutron flux density, the foil activation method was used. Thermal neutron flux determination in paraffin phantom by counting the emitted rays of indium foils with two different detectors (Geiger–Muller counter and {\bf NaI(Tl)}) was the aim of this project. The relative differences of the outcome of the experiments were between $2.5\%$ and $5\%$. The final results were compared with {\bf MCNP4C} outputs and the best agreement was generated using {\bf NaI(Tl)} by a minimum discrepancy of about $0.6\%$ for the foil placed 8.5 cm from the neutron source.</p>

In particular, the numerical Moiré ({\bf NM}) method was used to visualize the deformations and defects. The lattice structure of the microcrack was carefully observed at the nanoscale. {\bf HRTEM} images of the microcrack demonstrated that the lattice structure of most of the microcrack regions is regular with good periodicity. In addition, the microcrack cleavage expands alternately along different crystal planes, where the principal cleavage plane is the (111) crystal plane. The {\bf NM} maps showed no sharp plastic deformation around the microcrack, but discrete edge dislocations can be found only near the crack tip.</p>

It is known that ants communicate with each other by dropping a chemical, called pheromone, on the substrate. Apart from the studies in the literature, it was considered in the model that (i) ant colony consists of two kinds of ants, goodand poor-smelling ants, (ii) ants might make U-turn for some special reasons.

				<abstract>
					<p>The positive-parity bands in $^{224−234}$Th are studied using the projected shell model ({\bf PSM}) approach. The energy levels, deformation systematics, $B(E2)$ transition probabilities and nuclear $g$-factors are calculated and compared with the experimental data. The calculation reproduces the observed positive-parity yrast bands and $B(E2)$ transition probabilities. Measurement of $B(E2)$ transition probabilities for higher spins and $g$-factors would be a stringent test for our predictions. The results of theoretical calculations indicate that the deformation systematics in $^{224−234}$Th isotopes depend on the occupation of low $k$ components of high j orbits in the valence space and the deformation producing tendency of the neutron–proton interaction operating between spin orbit partner ({\bf SOP}) orbits, the $[(2g_{9/2}_{\pi}) - (2g_{7/2})_{\nu}]$ and $[(1i_{13/2})_{\pi} - (1i_{11/2})_{\nu}]$ {\bf SOP} orbits in the present context. In addition, the deformation systematics also depend on the polarization of $(1h_{11/2})_{\pi}$ orbit. The low-lying states of yrast spectra are found to arise from 0-quasiparticle ({\bf qp}) intrinsic states whereas the high-spin states turn out to possess composite structure.</p>

					<p>It is proposed to build a drift tube Linac ({\bf DTL}) at Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore, India, that will form a part of the future Spallation Neutron Source. This {\bf DTL} will accelerate 30 mA H-ion beam from 3 {\bf MeV} to 10 {\bf MeV}. The {\bf DTL} is designed to operate at 352.2 {\bf MHz} with a maximum duty cycle of $3\%$. The {\bf DTL} tank will consist of three sections, each about 1.2 m in length having 60 cells. The {\bf DTL} has a ramped accelerating field, which is ramped in the first section of {\bf DTL} from 1.8 to 2.2 MV/m and remains constant over the rest of the length of {\bf DTL}. The field in {\bf DTL} will be stabilized using post-couplers. The three-dimensional ({\bf 3D}) design of the {\bf DTL} is done using {\bf CST} microwave studio ({\bf CST MWS}) incorporating the various nonaxisymmetric components such as tuners, post-couplers and vacuum ports. The frequency shifts due to these components have been evaluated. This paper presents the details of the studies and analysis of 3D simulations of post-couplers, tuners and vacuum ports.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0995-1010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have theoretically investigated the high harmonic generation ({\bf HHG}) spectra of H$_{2}^{+}$ and HD$^{+}$ using a time-dependent wave packet approach for the nuclear motion with pulsed lasers of peak intensities $(I_{0})$ of $3.5 \times 10^{14}$ and $4.5 \times 10^{14}$ W/cm$^{2}$, wavelengths ($\lambda_{L}$) of 800 and 1064 nm, and pulse durations $(T)$ of 40 and 50 fs, for initial vibrational levels $\nu_{0} = 0$ and 1. We have argued that for these conditions the harmonic generation due to the transitions in the electronic continuum by tunnelling or multiphoton ionization will not be important. Thus, the characteristic features of {\bf HHG} spectra in our model arise only due to the nuclear motions on the two lowest field-coupled electronic states between which both interelectronic and intraelectronic (due to intrinsic dipole moments, for HD$^{+}$) radiative transitions can take place. For HD$^{+}$, the effect of nonadiabatic ({\bf NA}) interaction between the two lowest Born–Oppenheimer ({\bf BO}) electronic states has been taken into account and comparison has been made with the {\bf HHG} spectra of HD$^{+}$ obtained in the {\bf BO} approximation. Even harmonics and a second plateau in the {\bf HHG} spectra of HD$^{+}$ with the {\bf NA} interaction and hyper-Raman lines in the spectra of both H$_{2}^{+}$ and HD$^{+}$ for $\nu_{0} = 1$ have been observed for higher value of $I_{0}$ or $\lambda_{L}$. Our calculations indicate reasonable efficiencies of harmonic generation even without involving the electronic continuum.</p>

					<p>Irreversible normal zones leading to quench is an important aspect of high-temperature superconductors ({\bf HTS}) in all practical applications. As a consequence of quench, transport current gets diverted to the matrix stabilizer material of the high-$T_{c}$ composite and causes Joule heating till the original conditions are restored. The nature of growth of the resistive zone in the superconductor greatly influences the temperature evolution of the quenched zone. In this investigation, a complete mathematical analysis of the temperature profile evolution following a quench in a {\bf HTS} has been carried out. Such prediction in temperature profile would aid the design of {\bf HTS} tape-based practical applications in limiting the thermal stress-induced damages in off-normal scenarios.</p>

It has been found that, owing to the departure from the Maxwellian electron distribution to a vortex-like one, the dynamics of small but finite amplitude dust-acoustic ({\bf DA}) waves is governed by a nonlinear equation of modified Korteweg–de Vries ({\bf mKdV}) type (instead of {\bf KdV}). The reductive perturbation method was employed to study the basic features (amplitude, width, speed, etc.) of {\bf DA} solitary waves which are significantly modified by the presence of trapped electrons.

				<title>Vibrational properties of vacancy in bcc transition metals using embedded atom method potentials</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>1041-1054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The embedded atom method ({\bf EAM}) potentials, with the universal form of the embedding function along with the Morse form of pair potential, have been employed to determine the potential parameters for three bcc transition metals: Fe, Mo, and W, by fitting to Cauchy pressure $(C_{12} − C_{44})/2$, shear constants $G_{v} = (C_{11} − C_{12} + 3C_{44})/5$ and $C_{44}$, cohesive energy and the vacancy formation energy. The obtained potential parameters are used to calculate the phonon dispersion spectra of these metals. Large discrepancies are found between the calculated results of phonon dispersion using the {\bf EAM} and the experimental phonon dispersion results. Therefore, to overcome this inadequacy of the {\bf EAM} model, we employ the modified embedded atom method ({\bf MEAM}) in which a modified term along with the pair potential and embedding function is added in the total energy. The phonon dispersions calculated using potential parameters obtained from the {\bf MEAM} show good agreement with experimental results compared to those obtained from the {\bf EAM}. Using the calculated phonons, we evaluate the local density of states of the neighbours of vacancy using the Green’s function method. The local frequency spectrum of first neighbours of vacancy in {\bf Mo} shows an increase at higher frequencies and a shift towards the lower frequencies whereas in {\bf Fe} and {\bf W}, the frequency spectrum shows a small decrease towards higher frequency and small shift towards lower frequency. For the second neighbours of vacancy in all the three metals, the local frequency spectrum is not much different from that of the host atom. The local density of states of the neighbours of the vacancy has been used to calculate the mean square displacements and the formation entropy of vacancy. The calculated mean square displacements of the first neighbours of vacancy are found to be higher than that of the host atom, whereas it is lower for the second neighbours. The calculated results of the formation entropy of the vacancy compared well with other available results.</p>

Negative value of the chemical shift indicates that {\bf H} of {\bf H$_{2}$O} is closer to metal ions (Y$^{3+}$ or Eu$^{3+}$), which is a source of luminescence quencher. {\bf H} coupling and decoupling $^{31}${\bf P MAS NMR} spectra at 300 and 250 {\bf K} show the same chemical shift (−0.4 ppm) indicating that there is no direct bond between {\bf P} and {\bf H}. It is concluded that the confined water is not frozen even at 215 {\bf K} because of the less number of H-bonding.</p>

				<page>1065-1081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The bond constraint theory ({\bf BCT}) dealing with the rigidity caused by bond constraints and the long-range potential fluctuations ({\bf LRPF}) arising from the defects and heterogeneities in the disordered semiconductors are important for understanding the atomic and electronic properties of amorphous semiconductors. Here, they are applied to the already commercialized Ge$_{X}$Sb$_{Y}$ Te$_{1−X−Y}$ ({\bf GST}) chalcogenide glasses used in the rewritable phase change memory ({\bf PCM}) devices. The main concern at present is to improve their ability to withstand a large number of phase change cycles, by choosing the right composition. The two considerations ({\bf BCT} and {\bf LRPF}) are briefly described and tested on the most commonly used Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$ and the nearby compositions. While these considerations provide significant insight into their atomic and electronic structures, the ansatz linking them with the durability of the {\bf PCM} devices need to be justified by more work.</p>

				<title>Novel experimentally observed phenomena in soft matter</title>
				<feature>Invited Review</feature>
				<page>0003-0034</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Soft materials such as colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions and liquid crystals are constituted by mesoscopic entities held together by weak forces. Their mechanical moduli are several orders of magnitude lower than those of atomic solids. The application of small to moderate stresses to these materials results in the disruption of their microstructures. The resulting flow is non-Newtonian and is characterized by features such as shear rate-dependent viscosities and nonzero normal stresses. This article begins with an introduction to some unusual flow properties displayed by soft matter. Experiments that report a spectrum of novel phenomena exhibited by these materials, such as turbulent drag reduction, elastic turbulence, the formation of shear bands and the existence of rheological chaos, flow-induced birefringence and the unusual rheology of soft glassy materials, are reviewed. The focus then shifts to observations of the liquid-like response of granular media that have been subjected to external forces. The article concludes with examples of the patterns that emerge when certain soft materials are vibrated, or when they are displaced with Newtonian fluids of lower viscosities.</p>

				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0035-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This review reports on plasma response to transient high voltage pulses in a low pressure unmagnetized plasma. Mainly, the experiments are reviewed, when a disc electrode (metallic and dielectric) is biased pulsed negative or positive. The main aim is to review the electron loss in plasmas and particle balance during the negative pulse electrode biasing, when the applied pulse width is less than the ion plasma period. Though the applied pulse width is less than the ion plasma period, ion rarefaction waves are excited. The solitary electron holes are reviewed for positive pulsed bias to the electrode. Also the excitation of waves (solitary electron and ion holes) is reviewed for a metallic electrode covered by a dielectric material. The wave excitation during and after the pulse withdrawal, excitation and propagation characteristics of various electrostatic plasma waves are reviewed here.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The use of soft rotor formula ({\bf SRF}) for the level energies of $K = 2 \gamma$ -band for the shape transitional even $Z$ even $N$ nuclei in the medium mass region is illustrated. With proper treatment, we obtained positive values of the moment of inertia and softness parameter, as opposed to negative values reported in literature. The moments of inertia of the $\gamma$-band are almost equal to the ground state band values. The systematic dependence of the softness parameter on energy ratio $R_{4/2}$ is studied. The effect of the odd–even spin staggering on these parameters is studied in detail. In deformed nuclei, the same parameters for odd and even spin members yield fair energy values.</p>

				<title>A benchmark study on uncertainty of ALICE ASH 1.0, TALYS 1.0 and MCNPX 2.6 codes to estimate production yield of accelerator-based radioisotopes</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0087-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radioisotopes find very important applications in various sectors of economic significance and their production is an important activity of many national programmes. Some deterministic codes such as {\bf ALICE ASH} 1.0 and {\bf TALYS 1.0} are extensively used to calculate the yield of a radioisotope via numerical integral over the calculated cross-sections. {\bf MCNPX} 2.6 stochastic code is more interesting among the other Monte Carlo-based computational codes for accessibility of different intranuclear cascade physical models to calculate the yield using experiment-based cross-sections. A benchmark study has been proposed to determine the codes' uncertainty in such calculations. $^{109}$Cd, $^{86}$Y and $^{85}$Sr production yields by proton irradiation of silver, rubidium chloride and strontium carbonate targets are studied. $^{109}$Cd, $^{86}$Y and $^{85}$Sr cross-sections are calculated using {\bf ALICE ASH 1.0} and {\bf TALYS 1.0} codes. The evaluated yields are compared with the experimental yields. The targets are modelled using {\bf MCNPX 2.6} code. The production yields are calculated using the available physical models of the code. The study shows acceptable relative discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results. Minimum relative discrepancy between experimental and theoretical yields is achievable using {\bf ISABEL} intranuclear model in most of the targets simulated by {\bf MCNPX 2.6.} The stochastic code utilization can be suggested for calculating $^{109}$Cd, $^{86}$Y and $^{85}$Sr production yields. It results in more valid data than {\bf TALYS 1.0} and {\bf ALICE ASH 1.0} in noticeably less average relative discrepancies.</p>

				<title>Systematic study of multiparticle production in nucleus–nucleus interactions at 14.6 A GeV</title>

				<page>0103-0115</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An experimental analysis of 855 events induced by 14.6 A GeV $^{28}$Si in nuclear emulsion is presented. Mean multiplicities of charged secondary particles produced in the nuclear interactions are studied and compared with the results from the other experiments for the same projectile at 3.7 A GeV as well as data for proton at similar energy (14 GeV). An analysis of pseudorapidity densities of target fragments (black and grey particles) is also performed. The behaviour of the {\bf KNO} scaling law of the multiplicity distribution for shower particles has been examined. In order to accumulate knowledge about the intermittent behaviour of shower particles, the scaled factorial moments ({\bf SFM}s) are computed in $\eta$-space and $\phi$-space for a set of data in the $^{28}$Si–AgBr events. Furthermore, validity of limiting fragmentation of shower particles produced in central collision events induced by $^{28}$Si-emulsion interactions has been tested. A crude estimation for the energy density of the nuclear matter formed in the central collision events at our energy has been examined.</p>

				<title>Investigation of invisible oscillation on the photodetachment cross-section of H$_{2}^{-}$ near a hard surface</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0117-0126</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Induced effects in the photodetached electron spectra from a diatomic negative ion (H$_{2}^{-}$) near a hard surface are investigated. A $z$-polarized laser is used to knock off electrons from H$_{2}^{-}$ in the vicinity of a hard surface. Theoretical imaging method is used to derive a generalized modulation function for the total photodetachment cross-section, which describes invisible oscillation. It is found that the hard surface strongly affects the detached electron flux as well as total photodetachment cross-section. There exists strong dependence on the distance of H$_{2}^{-}$ from the hard surface and also on the separation of atomic centres of H$_{2}^{-}$. Unlike the detached electron flux, no visible oscillations are noted in the photodetachment cross-section.</p>

				<title>Vibrational resonance in the Morse oscillator</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0127-0141</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The occurrence of vibrational resonance is investigated in both classical and quantum mechanical Morse oscillators driven by a biharmonic force. The biharmonic force consists of two forces of widely different frequencies $\omega$ and $\Omega$ with $\Omega \gg \omega$. In the damped and biharmonically driven classical Morse oscillator, by applying a theoretical approach, an analytical expression is obtained for the response amplitude at the low-frequency $\omega$. Conditions are identified on the parameters for the occurrence of resonance. The system shows only one resonance and moreover at resonance the response amplitude is $1/d\omega$ where $d$ is the coefficient of linear damping. When the amplitude of the high-frequency force is varied after resonance the response amplitude does not decay to zero but approaches a nonzero limiting value. It is observed that vibrational resonance occurs when the sinusoidal force is replaced by a square-wave force. The occurrence of resonance and antiresonance of transition probability of quantum mechanical Morse oscillator is also reported in the presence of the biharmonic external field.</p>

				<title>A simplistic pedagogical formulation of a thermal speed distribution using a relativistic framework</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0143-0156</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A novel pedagogical technique is presented that can be used in the undergraduate ({\bf UG}) class to formulate a relativistically extended kinetic theory of gases and thermal speed distribution, while assuming the basic thermal symmetry arguments of the famous Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution as presented at the {\bf UG} level. The adopted framework can be used by students to understand the physics of a thermally governed system at high temperature and speeds, without having to indulge in high level tensor-based mathematics, as has been done by the previous works on the subject. Our approach, a logical extension of that proposed by Maxwell, will first recapitulate what is taught and known in the {\bf UG} class and then present a methodology inspired from the Maxwell–Boltzmann framework that will help students to understand and derive the physics of relativistic thermal systems. The methodology uses simple tools well known to undergraduates and involves a component of computational techniques that can be used to involve students in this exercise. We have tried to place the current work in a larger perspective with regard to the earlier works done and emphasize on its simplicity and accessibility to students. Towards the end, interesting implications of the relativistically extended distribution are presented and compared with the Maxwell–Boltzmann results at various temperatures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electron cyclotron resonance ({\bf ECR}) plasma was produced at 2.45 GHz using 200 – 750 W microwave power. The plasma was produced from argon gas at a pressure of $2 \times 10^{−4}$ mbar. Three water-cooled solenoid coils were used to satisfy the {\bf ECR} resonant conditions inside the plasma chamber. The basic parameters of plasma, such as electron density, electron temperature, floating potential, and plasma potential, were evaluated using the current–voltage curve using a Langmuir probe. The effect of microwave power coupling to the plasma was studied by varying the microwave power. It was observed that the optimum coupling to the plasma was obtained for $\sim$ 600 W microwave power with an average electron density of $\sim 6 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{−3}$ and average electron temperature of $\sim$ 9 eV.</p>

					<p>The Coxeter–Weyl groups $W(A_{4})$, $W(B_{4})$ and $W(D_{4})$ have proven very useful for two-qubit systems in quantum information theory. A simple technique is employed to construct the unitary matrix representations of the groups, based on quaternionic transformation of the usual reflection matrices. The von Neumann entropy of each reduced density matrix is calculated. It is shown that these unitary matrix representations are naturally related to various universal quantum gates and they lead to entangled states. Canonical decomposition of generators in terms of fundamental gate representations is given to construct the quantum circuits.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Matter-wave bright solitons in bichromatic lattice potentials are considered and their dynamics for different lattice environments are studied. Bichromatic potentials are created from superpositions of (i) two linear optical lattices and (ii) a linear and a nonlinear optical lattice. Effective potentials are found for the solitons in both bichromatic lattices and a comparative study is done on the dynamics of solitons with respect to the effective potentials. The effects of dispersion on solitons in bichromatic lattices are studied and it is found that the dispersive spreading can be minimized by appropriate combinations of lattice and interaction parameters. Stability of nondispersive matter-wave solitons is checked from phase portrait analysis.</p>

					<p>Static spherically symmetric space-time is studied to describe dense compact star with quark matter within the framework of {\bf MIT} Bag Model. The system of Einstein’s field equations for anisotropic matter is expressed as a new system of differential equations using transformations and it is solved for a particular general form of gravitational potential with parameters. For a particular parameter, as an example, it is shown that the model satisfies all major physical features expected in a realistic star.

					<p>Multiplicity distributions of shower particles and target fragments in $^{7}$Li–Em (emulsion) collisions at 3 A GeV/c are experimentally studied. In the framework of the multisource thermal model, the multicomponent Erlang distribution is used to describe the experimental multiplicity distributions of shower particles, grey fragments, black fragments, and heavily ionized fragments. The correlations between these multiplicities are experimentally reported. With the increase of impacting centrality (or the target fragment multiplicity), a saturation phenomenon for shower particle multiplicity is observed in the experiment.</p>

Spectral chirp of the dye laser as they evolve in the cavity due to transient phase dynamics of the amplifier gain medium is studied. Effect of grating efficiency, focal spot size, pump power and other cavity parameters on the temporal behaviour of narrow band dye laser such as build-up time, pulse shape and pulse width is studied using the four level dye laser rate equation and photon evolution equation. These results are compared with experimental observations of {\bf GIG} single-mode dye laser cavity.

				<page>0309-0317</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The quantum capacitance, an important parameter in the design of nanoscale devices, is derived for armchair-edge single-layer graphene nanoribbon with semiconducting property. The quantum capacitance oscillations are found and these capacitance oscillations originate from the lateral quantum confinement in graphene nanoribbon. Detailed studies of the capacitance oscillations demonstrate that the local channel electrostatic potential at the capacitance peak, the height and the number of the capacitance peak strongly depend on the width, especially a few nanometres, of the armchair-edge graphene nanoribbon. It implies that the capacitance oscillations observed in the experiments can be utilized to measure the width of graphene nanoribbon. The results also show that the capacitance oscillations are not seen when the width is larger than 30 nm.</p>

					<p>Well-dispersed undoped and Mg-doped {\bf ZnO} nanoparticles with different doping concentrations at various annealing temperatures are synthesized using basic chemical solution method without any capping agent. To understand the effect of {\bf Mg} doping and heat treatment on the structure and optical response of the prepared nanoparticles, the samples are characterized using {\bf X-ray} diffraction ({\bf XRD}), energy-dispersive X-ray ({\bf EDX}), {\bf UV–V}is optical absorption, photoluminescence ({\bf PL}), scanning electron microscopy ({\bf SEM}) and transmission electron microscopy ({\bf TEM}) measurements. The {\bf UV–V}is absorbance and {\bf PL} emission show a blue shift with increasing {\bf Mg} doping concentration with respect to bulk value. {\bf UV–V}is spectroscopy is also used to calculate the band-gap energy of nanoparticles. {\bf X-ray} diffraction results clearly show that the {\bf Mg}-doped nanoparticles have hexagonal phase similar to {\bf ZnO} nanoparticles. {\bf TEM} image as well as {\bf XRD} study confirm the estimated average size of the samples to be between 6 and 12 nm. Furthermore, it is seen that there was an increase in the grain size of the particles when the annealing temperature is increased.</p>

					<p>Nanostructured {\bf ZnO:Mn} thin films have been prepared by sol–gel dip coating method. The content of {\bf Mn} in the sol was varied from 0 to 12 wt$\%$. The effect of {\bf Mn} concentration on the optical, structural, and morphological properties of {\bf ZnO} thin films were studied by using Fourier transform infrared {\bf (FTIR), UV}–visible and photoluminescence ({\bf PL}) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction ({\bf XRD}) and scanning electron microscopy ({\bf SEM}). {\bf XRD} results showed that the films have hexagonal wurtzite structure at lower content of {\bf Mn}. The diffraction peaks corresponding to {\bf ZnO} disappeared and two diffraction peaks of {\bf MnO$_{2}$} and {\bf Mn$_{3}$O$_{4}$} appeared at the highest value of doping concentration (viz., 12 wt$\%$). {\bf SEM} results revealed that the surface smoothness of the films improved at higher content of {\bf Mn}. The optical band gap of the films decreased from 3.89 to 3.15 eV when the Mn concentration increased from 0 to 12 wt$\%$. The PL spectra of the films showed the characteristic peaks linked to band-to-band, green and yellow emissions. Besides, the PL intensity of the samples decreased with increase in Mn concentration.</p>

				<title>Solar diurnal anisotropy measured using muons in GRAPES-3 experiment in 2006</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0343-0357</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The GRAPES-3 experiment at Ooty contains a large-area (560 m$^{2}$) tracking muon detector. This detector consists of 16 modules, each 35 m$^{2}$ in area, that are grouped into four supermodules of 140 m$^{2}$ each. The threshold energy of muons is $\sec(\theta)$ GeV along a direction with zenith angle $\theta$ and the angular resolution of the muon detector is $6^{\circ}$. Typically, it records $\sim 4 \times 10^{9}$ muons every day. The muon detector has been operating uninterruptedly since 2001, thus providing a high statistics record of the cosmic ray flux as a function of time over one decade. However, prior to using these data, the muon rate has to be corrected for two important atmospheric effects, namely, variations in atmospheric pressure and temperature. Because of the near equatorial location of Ooty ($11.4^{\circ}$N), the seasonal variations in the atmospheric temperature are relatively small and shall be ignored here. Due to proximity to the equator, the pressure changes at Ooty display a dominant 12 h periodic behaviour in addition to other seasonal changes. Here, we discuss various aspects of a novel method for accurate pressure measurement and subsequent corrections applied to the GRAPES-3 muon data to correct these pressure-induced variations. The pressure-corrected muon data are used to measure the profile of the solar diurnal anisotropy during 2006. The data, when divided into four segments, display significant variation both in the amplitude ($\sim 45\%$) and phase ($\sim42$ m) of the solar diurnal anisotropy during 2006, which was a period of relatively low solar activity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>It is shown that Painlevé integrability of $(2+1)$-dimensional Boiti–Leon–Pempinelli equation is easy to be verified using the standard Weiss–Tabor–Carnevale ({\bf WTC}) approach after introducing the Kruskal’s simplification. Furthermore, by employing a singular manifold method based on Painlevé truncation, variable separation solutions are obtained explicitly in terms of two arbitrary functions. The two arbitrary functions provide us a way to study some interesting localized structures. The choice of rational functions leads to the rogue wave structure of Boiti–Leon–Pempinelli equation. In addition, for the other choices, it is observed that two solitons may evolve into breather after interaction. Also, the interaction between two kink compactons is investigated.</p>

				<title>Spin–momenta entanglement in moving frames: Properties of von Neumann entropy</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0385-0393</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fact that spin–momentum of massive particles become entangled (disentangled) as seen by moving observers, is used to investigate the properties of von Neumann entropy, as a measure of spin–momentum entanglement. To do so, we partition the total Hilbert space into momentum and spin subspaces so that the entanglement occurs between total spin states and total momenta of two spin-$\dfrac{1}{2}$  particles. Assuming that the occurrence of spin–momentum states is determined by Gaussian probability distributions, we show that the degree of entanglement ascends for small rapidities, reaches a maximum and diminishes at high rapidity. We further report how the characteristics of this behaviour vary as the widths of distributions change. In particular, a separable state, resulting from equal distribution widths, indeed becomes entangled in moving frames.</p>

					<p>This paper presents a new scheme for constructing bidirectional nonlinear coupled chaotic systems which synchronize projectively. Conditions necessary for projective synchronization ({\bf PS}) of two bidirectionally coupled chaotic systems are derived using Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed {\bf PS} scheme is discussed by taking as examples the so-called unified chaotic model, the Lorenz–Stenflo system and the nonautonomous chaotic Van der Pol oscillator.

					<p>Hypothetical superheavy fourth-generation fermions with a very small coupling with the rest of the Standard Model can give rise to long enough lived bound states. The production and the detection of these bound states would be experimentally feasible at the {\bf LHC}. Extending, in the present study, the analysis of other authors, a semirelativistic wave equation is solved using an accurate numerical method to determine the binding energies of these possible superheavy fermion-bound states. The interaction given by the Yukawa potential of the Higgs boson exchange is considered; the corresponding relativistic corrections are calculated by means of a model based on the covariance properties of the Hamiltonian. We study the effects given by the Coulomb force. Moreover, we calculate the contributions given by the Coulombic and confining terms of the strong interaction in the case of superheavy quark bound states. The results of the model are critically analysed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper the classical evolution of a particle is studied which bounces back and forth in a 1D vibrating cavity such that the reflection from the wall does not change the speed of the particle. A peculiar behaviour of the particle motion can be seen where the time evolution of the motion shows superposition of linear and oscillatory behaviour. In particular, the parameter range is found in which the particle oscillates between the walls in steady state as if the wall was static and it is showed that for these parameter ranges the particle settles to this steady state for all initial conditions. It is proposed that this phenomenon can be used to bunch charged particles in short pulses where the synchronization proposed in our model should work against the space charge effect in the charged particle bunch.</p>

				<title>Performance assessment of nanoscale Schottky MOSFET as resonant tunnelling device: Non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0511-0520</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive study is performed on the electrical characteristics of Schottky barrier {\bf MOSFET (SBMOSFET)} in nanoscale regime, by employing the non-equilibrium Green’s function {\bf (NEGF)} approach. Quantum confinement results in the enhancement of effective Schottky barrier height {\bf (SBH)}. High enough Schottky barriers at the source/drain and the channel form a double barrier profile along the channel that results in the formation of resonance states. We have, for the first time, proposed a resonant tunnelling device based on {\bf SBMOSFET} in which multiple resonance states are modulated by the gate voltage. Role of essential factors such as temperature, {\bf SBH}, bias voltage and structural parameters on the feasibility of this device for silicon-based resonant tunnelling applications are extensively studied. Resonant tunnelling appears at low temperatures and low drain voltages and as a result negative differential resistance {\bf (NDR)} is apparent in the transfer characteristic. Scaling down the gate length to 6 nm increases the peak-to-valley ratio {\bf (PVR)} of the drain current. As the effective {\bf SBH} reduces, the curvature of the double barrier profile is gradually diminished. Therefore, multiple resonant states are contributed to the current and consequently resonant tunnelling is smoothed out.</p>

				<page>0521-0533</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Adirovitch set of equations has been modified to explain the mechanisms involved in thermoluminescence ({\bf TL}) glow curve. A simple model is proposed which explains the occurrence of {\bf TL} glow curve involving any extent of retrapping or any order of kinetics. It has been observed that the extents of recombination and simultaneous rewrapping decide the order of kinetics involved. {\bf TL} decay parameters, order of kinetics and initial concentration of trapped electrons per unit volume are evaluated easily and conveniently. It has been observed that retrapping increases with increasing order of kinetics.</p>

				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0535-0545</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper reports the pulsed laser-based photoacoustic ({\bf PA}) spectroscopy of {\bf NO$_{2}$} in a resonant {\bf PA} cavity with special filters made of stainless steel. The {\bf PA} cell along with special types of sound filters are designed and fabricated to excite only the second-order longitudinal mode inside the cavity. The second harmonic, i.e. $\lambda = 532$ nm pulse width, of 7 ns obtained from $Q$-switched {\bf Nd:YAG} laser at 10 Hz repetition rate has been used to study the saturation behaviour of the {\bf PA} signal and absorption coefficient with respect to the input laser energy. Generally, the $Q$-factor of longitudinal modes in the acoustic cavities is quite low. However, by modifying the design of the cell and the filter, we can achieve high value of $Q = 30$. The combination of special filter along with the experimental data acquisition technique helped us to achieve the minimum detection concentration of {\bf NO$_{2}$} of the order of 9 ppbV which is much better than the previous value of the same {\bf PA} cell without filter [Yehya and Chaudhary, {\textit{Appl. Phys. B}} {\bf 106}, 953 (2012)].</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes two new techniques which give improved exponential finite difference solutions of Burgers’ equation. These techniques are called implicit exponential finite difference method and fully implicit exponential finite difference method for solving Burgers’ equation. As the Burgers’ equation is nonlinear, the scheme leads to a system of nonlinear equations. At each time-step, Newton’s method is used to solve this nonlinear system. The results are compared with exact values and it is clearly shown that results obtained using both the methods are precise and reliable.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Einstein–Maxwell equations describing static charged spheres with uniform density and variable electric field intensity are studied. The special case of constant electric field is also studied. The evolution of the model is governed by a hypergeometric differential equation which has a general solution in terms of special functions. Several classes of exact solutions are identified which may be considered as charged generalizations of the incompressible Schwarzschild interior model. An analysis of the physical features is undertaken for the uniform case. It is demonstrated that uniform density spheres with constant electric field intensity are not realizable with isotropic pressures. This highlights the necessity of studying the criteria for physical admissability of gravitating spheres in general relativity which are solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell equations.</p>

					<p>The sd-interacting boson approximation (sd-{\bf IBA}) and the df-interacting boson approximation (df-{\bf IBA}) can be related to each other and the states of the interacting boson approximation model can be identified with the fully symmetric states in the sdf interacting boson approximation model.

We showed that the interacting boson approximation may account for many of these $K^{\pi} = 0^{+}$ states.

				<abstract>
					<p>With an aim to understand the effects of breakup and transfer channels on elastic scattering and fusion cross-sections in the $^{7}{\text{Li}} + ^{27}{\text{Al}}$ reaction, simultaneous measurement of elastic scattering angular distributions and fusion cross-sections have been carried out at various energies ($E_{\text{lab}} = 8.0–16.0$ MeV) around the Coulomb barrier. Optical model ({\bf OM}) analysis of the elastic scattering data does not show any threshold anomaly or breakup threshold anomaly behaviour in the energy dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the {\bf OM} potential. Fusion cross-section at each bombarding energy is extracted from the measured $\alpha$-particle evaporation energy spectra at backward angles by comparing with the statistical model prediction. Results on fusion cross-sections from the present measurements along with data from the literature have been compared with the coupled-channels predictions. Detailed coupled-channels calculations have been carried out to study the effect of coupling of breakup, inelastic and transfer, channels on elastic scattering and fusion. The effect of $1n$-stripping transfer coupling was found to be significant compared to that of the projectile breakup couplings in the present system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The transient analytical solutions of temperature distribution, stress, strain and optical path difference in convectional cooled end-pumped laser rod are derived. The results are compared with other works and good agreements are found. The effects of increasing the edge cooling and face cooling are studied. It is found that an increase in the edge cooling has significant effect on reducing the maximum temperature that can be reached in the laser rod but it has no effect on the value of optical path difference. It is also found that increasing this type of cooling significantly reduces the time required to reach the thermal equilibrium with a slight increase in the max. tensile hoop stress that can be reached as the cooling increases. On the other hand, increase in face cooling reduces the response time, optical path difference and the maximum temperature that can be reached in the laser rod but a significant increase in the max. tensile hoop stress is observed. A matching between the advantages of these two type of cooling may be useful for a designer.</p>

					<p>Interaction of nonplanar ion-acoustic solitary waves is an important source of information for studying the nature and characteristics of ion-acoustic solitary waves ({\bf IASW}s). The head-on collision between two cylindrical/spherical {\bf IASW}s in un-magnetized plasmas comprising of nonthermal distributed electrons and warm ions is investigated using the extended version of Poincaré–Lighthill–Kuo ({\bf PLK}) perturbation method. How the interactions are taking place in cylindrical and spherical geometries are shown numerically. Analytical phase shifts are derived for nonplanar geometry. The effects of the ion to electron temperature parameter and the nonthermal electrons parameter on the phase shift are studied. It is shown that the properties of the interaction of {\bf IASW}s in different geometries are very different.</p>

Laplace transform technique is adopted for finding solutions for velocity, temperature and concentration with unit Prandtl and Schmidt numbers. Solutions of unsteady state for larger times are compared with the solutions of steady state. Velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are analysed for various sets of physical parameters. Skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are shown graphically. It has been found that the thermal as well as mass stratification affects the flow appreciably.</p>

				<page>0667-0676</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Critical current ($I_{c}$) characteristics of {\bf 2G YBCO} superconducting tape under the influence of twisting moment was experimentally investigated at varying current ramp rates in the self-field. Under a uniform twist, the degradation in the current-carrying capacity of {\bf YBCO} tape up to $30\%$ was observed at 77 K. The degradation is largely attributed to the shear stress and torsional shear strain resulting from the twisting. The superconductor to resistive transition index, $n$, is also found to behave in an identical manner with increase in the twisting. Finite element analysis ({\bf FEA}) of the tape in the experimental configuration with twisting moment being applied on to it has been carried out in {\bf COMSOL}. The torsional strain calculated analytically as per the experimental configuration matches closely with that of {\bf FEA} results, which shows that the critical current degradation is a function of strain.</p>

					<p>We report an investigation of the oscillation death ({\bf OD}) of a parametrically excited coupled van der Pol–Mathieu ({\bf vdPM}) system. The system can be considered as a pair of harmonically forced van der Pol oscillators under a double-well potential. The two oscillators are coupled with a cubic nonlinearity. We have shown that the system arrives at an {\bf OD} regime when coupling strength crosses a threshold value at which the system undergoes saddle-node bifurcation and two limit cycles coalesce onto a fixed point of the system. We have further shown that this nonautonomous system possesses a centre manifold corresponding to the {\bf OD} regime.</p>

				<title>Observational constraints on modified Chaplygin gas in Horava–Lifshitz gravity with dark radiation</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Cosmological models with modified Chaplygin gas ({\bf MCG}) in the framework of Horava–Lifshitz ({\bf HL}) theory of gravity, both with and without detailed balance, are obtained. The equation of state ({\bf EOS}) for a {\bf MCG} contains three unknown parameters namely, $A, \alpha, B$. The allowed values of some of these parameters of the {\bf EOS} are determined using the recent astrophysical and cosmological observational data. Using observational data from $H(z)-z$, baryon acoustic oscillation ({\bf BAO}) peak parameter and cosmic microwave background ({\bf CMB}) shift parameter we study cosmologies in detailed-balance and beyond detailed-balance scenario. In this paper we take up the beyond detailed-balance scenario in totality and contribution of dark radiation in detailedbalance scenario on the parameters of the {\bf EOS}. We explore the effect of dark radiation on the whole range of the effective neutrino parameter ($\Delta N_{\nu}$) to constrain matter contributing parameter $B$ in both the detailed-balance and the beyond detailed-balance scenarios. It has been observed that greater the dark radiation less the matter contribution in the {\bf MCG} in both the scenario considered here. In order to check the validity of beyond detailed-balance scenario we plot supernovae magnitudes ($\mu$) with red-shift of Union2 data and then the variation of state parameter with redshift is studied. It is noted that beyond detailed-balance scenario is suitable for cosmological model in {\bf HL} gravity with {\bf MCG}.</p>

Numerical simulations on time-delayed Lorenz and hyperchaotic Chen systems are also carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Note that under the scheme the chaotic system is controlled only at discrete time instants, and so it reduces the control cost in real applications.</p>

Moreover, this equation is classified into three categories: extended Caudrey–Dodd–Gibbon–Sawada–Kotera ({\bf CDGSK}) equation, extended Lax equation and extended Kaup–Kuperschmidt ({\bf KK}) equation. The corresponding singularity manifold equations and auto-Bäcklund transformations of these three equations are also obtained.

					<p>The average of the moments for event shapes in $e^{+} e^{-} \rightarrow$ hadrons within the context of next-to-leading order ({\bf NLO}) perturbative {\bf QCD} prediction in dispersive model is studied. Moments used in this article are $\langle 1 - T \rangle, \langle \rho \rangle, \langle B_{T} \rangle$ and $\langle B_{W} \rangle$. We extract $\alpha_{s}$, the coupling constant in perturbative theory and α0 in the non-perturbative theory using the dispersive model. By fitting the experimental data, the values of $\alpha_{s} (M_{Z^{\circ}}) = 0.1171 \pm 0.00229$ and  $\alpha_{0} (\mu_{I} = 2{\text{GeV}}) = 0.5068 \pm 0.0440$ are found. Our results are consistent with the above model. Our results are also consistent with those obtained from other experiments at different energies. All these features are explained in this paper.</p>

Also, by using the above observables, the strong coupling constant ($\alpha_{s}$) is determined and how much its value is affected by the {\bf NNLO} correction is demonstrated. By combining the results for all variables at different centre-of-mass energies $\alpha_{s} (M_{Z^{\circ}}) = 0.1248 \pm 0.0009 ({\text{exp.}})_{-0.0144}^{+0.0283} ({\text{theo.}})$ is obtained.</p>

				<title>The asymptotic D-state to S-state ratio of triton</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0799-0806</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At low energies, an effective field theory ({\bf EFT}) with only contact interactions as well as three-body forces allow a detailed analysis of renormalization in a non-perturbative context and uncovers novel asymptotic behaviour. Triton as a three-body system, based on the {\bf EFT} have been previously shown to provide representative binding energies, charge radii, {\bf S}-wave scattering amplitude and asymptotic normalization constants for the {\bf $^{3}$H} bound state system. Herein, {\bf EFT} predictions of the asymptotic {\bf D}-state to {\bf S}-state ratio of triton are calculated to more fully evaluate the adequacy of the {\bf EFT} model. Manifestly model-independent calculations can be carried out to high orders, leading to high precision.</p>

				<title>Fission characteristics of $^{216}$Ra formed in heavy-ion induced reactions</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0807-0817</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A Kramers-modified statistical model is used to calculate the cross-section of the evaporation residue, fission cross-section, average pre-fission multiplicities of protons and $\alpha$-particles for $^{216}$Ra formed in $^{19}{\text{F}} + ^{197}{\text{Au}}$ reactions and results are compared with the experimental data. To calculate these quantities, the effects of temperature and spin $K$ about the symmetry axis have been considered in the calculations of the potential energy surfaces and the fission widths. It is shown that the results of the calculations using values of the temperature coefficient of the effective potential $k = 0.008 \pm 0.003$ MeV$^{−2}$ and scaling factor of the fission-barrier height $r_{s} = 1.004 \pm 0.002$ are in good agreement with the experimental data.</p>

				<title>Fundamental modes of new dispersive SH-waves in piezoelectromagnetic plate</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0819-0827</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fundamental modes of new dispersive shear-horizontal ({\bf SH}) acoustic waves propagating in the (6 mm) piezoelectromagnetic plate are studied. These {\bf SH}-waves can propagate when the following boundary conditions are exploited for both the upper and lower surfaces of the plate: (1) when the surfaces are mechanically free, electrically and magnetically closed and (2) when the surfaces are mechanically free, electrically and magnetically open. The {\bf SH}-waves depend on the electromagnetic wave speed $V_{\text{EM}} = 1/\sqrt{(\varepsilon \mu)}$ and can only exist when the electromagnetic constant $\alpha \neq 0$. The calculations (first evidence) were performed for the {\bf PZT-5H–Terfenol-D} which is a composite with a large value of $\alpha$. The limit cases of large values of $\alpha (\alpha^{2} = 0.5\varepsilon \mu, \alpha^{2} = 0.9\varepsilon \mu)$, and $\alpha^{2} = 0.99\varepsilon \mu$) are studied because they satisfy the limitation condition of $\alpha^{2} &#60; \varepsilon \mu$.</p>

				<title>Development of online quasimonochromatic X-ray backlighter for high energy density physics studies</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0829-0838</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Monochromatic X-ray backlighting has been employed with great success in various laser plasma experiments including inertial confinement fusion ({\bf ICF}) research. However, implementation of a monochromatic backlighting system typically requires extremely high quality spherically bent crystals which are difficult to manufacture and are also expensive. In this paper, we present a quasimonochromatic X-ray backlighting system using flat thallium acid pthalate ({\bf TAP}) crystal. The detailed characterization of the system is discussed. The X-ray backlighter spectral range is caliberated using Cu spectrum in the spectral range 7–9 Å (1.38–1.77 keV). Gold plasma produces continuous X-ray spectrum (M band) in this range. The spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions of the system measured are 30 mÅ, 50 $\mu$m and 1.5 ns respectively. The spectral width of the X-ray pulse is 2 Å ($\Delta E$ = 0.39 keV).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The bound states of four bosons in the quantum $\beta$-Fermi–Pasta–Ulam model are investigated and some interesting results are presented using the number conserving approximation combined with the number state method. We find that the relative magnitude of anharmonic coefficient has a significant effect on forming localized energy in the model, and the wave number plays an important role in forming different bound states. The signature of the quantum breather is also set up by the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenvectors in real space.</p>

				<title>Effective thermal conductivity of condensed polymeric nanofluids (nanosolids) controlled by diffusion and interfacial scattering</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0849-0864</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal properties of polymeric nanosolids, obtained by condensing the corresponding nanofluids, are investigated using photothermal techniques. The heat transport properties of two sets of polyvinyl alcohol ({\bf PVA}) based nanosolids, {\bf TiO$_{2}$/PVA} and {\bf Cu/PVA}, prepared by condensing the respective nanofluids, which are prepared by dispersing nanoparticles of {\bf TiO$_{2}$} and metallic copper in liquid {\bf PVA}, are reported. Two photothermal techniques, the photoacoustic and the photopyroelectric techniques, have been employed for measuring thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of these nanosolids. The experimental results indicate that thermal conduction in these polymer composites is controlled by heat diffusion through the embedded particles and interfacial scattering at matrix–particle boundaries. These two mechanisms are combined to arrive at an expression for their effective thermal conductivity. Analysis of the results reveals the possibility to tune the thermal conductivity of such nanosolids over a wide range using the right types of nanoparticles and right concentration.</p>

				<title>Magnetic field effect on state energies and transition frequency of a strong-coupling polaron in an anisotropic quantum dot</title>
				<feature>Research Articles</feature>
				<page>0865-0871</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By employing a variational method of the Pekar-type, which has different variational parameters in the $x–y$ plane and the $z$-direction, we study the ground and the first excited state energies and transition frequency between the ground and the first excited states of a strong-coupling polaron in an anisotropic quantum dot ({\bf AQD}) under an applied magnetic field along the $z$-direction. The effects of the magnetic field and the electron–phonon coupling strength are taken into account. It is found that the ground and the first excited state energies and the transition frequency are increasing functions of the external applied magnetic field. The ground state and the first excited state energies are decreasing functions, whereas transition frequency is an increasing function of the electron–phonon coupling strength. We find two ways of tuning the state energies and the transition frequency: by adjusting (1) the magnetic field and (2) the electron–phonon coupling strength.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Based on the transverse Ising model ({\bf TIM}) and using the mean-field theory, we investigate the phase transition properties of a cylindrical ferroelectric nanowire. Two different kinds of phase diagrams are constructed. We discuss systematically the effects of exchange interactions and the transverse field parameters on the phase diagrams. Moreover, the cross-over features of the parameters from the ferroelectric dominant phase diagram to the paraelectric dominant phase diagram are determined for the ferroelectric nanowire. In addition, the polarizations of the surface shell and the core are illustrated in detail by modifying the {\bf TIM} parameters.</p>

					<p>Pseudopotential plane-wave method ({\bf PP–PW}) based on density functional theory ({\bf DFT}) and density functional perturbation theory ({\bf DFPT}) within the Teter and Pade exchangecorrelation functional form of the local spin density approximation ({\bf LSDA}) is applied to study the effect of pressure on the elastic and piezoelectric properties of the ({\bf B3}) boron–bismuth compound. The phase transition, the independent elastic stiffness constants, the bulk modulus, the direct and converse piezoelectric coefficients, the longitudinal, transverse, and average sound velocities, and finally the Debye temperature under pressure are studied. The results obtained are generally lower than the available theoretical data (experimental data are not available) reported in the literature.</p>
