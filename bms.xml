				<title>Sol–gel processing of carbidic glasses</title>
				<feature>Glasses</feature>
				<page>0001-0004</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Carbon incorporation into the silicate network results in the formation of rigid carbidic glasses with improved physical, mechanical and thermal properties. This generated great interest in the development of these heteroatom structured materials through different processing routes. In the present studies, sol–gel processing has been used to prepare silicon based glasses, especially oxycarbides through organic–inorganic hybrid gels by hydrolysis–condensation reactions in silicon alkoxides, 1,4-butanediol and furfuryl alcohol with an aim to introduce Si–C linkages in the precursors at sol level. The incorporation of these linkages has been studied using IR and NMR spectroscopy. These bonds, so introduced, are maintained throughout the processing, especially during pyrolysis to high temperatures. In FFA–TEOS system, copolymerization with optimized mol ratio of the two results in resinous mass. This precursor on pyrolysis to $1000^\circ $C results in Si–O–C type amorphous solid black mass. XRD studies on the materials heated to $1400^\circ $C exhibit presence of crystalline Si–C and cristobalites in amorphous Si–O–C mass. In organic–inorganic gel system, the pyrolysed mass exhibits phase stability up to much higher temperatures. The carbidic materials so produced have been found to exhibit good resistance against oxidation at $1000^\circ $C.</p>

				<title>Collective modes in Ca$_{70}$Mg$_{30}$ glass</title>
				<feature>Glasses</feature>
				<page>0005-0009</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The self-consistent phonon scheme given by Takeno and Goda, involving multiple scattering and phonon eigen frequencies which are expressed in terms of many-body correlation functions of atoms as well as of interatomic potential in the solids, has been used to generate the collective modes in the Ca$_{70}$Mg$_{30}$ glass. A model potential is proposed to describe the effective interaction in the glass. Three different forms of the local field correction functions viz. Hartree, Taylor and Ichimaru and Utsumi are used to examine relative influence of exchange and correlation effects. The phonon frequencies of the longitudinal and transverse modes are computed employing the theoretical formulation of Hubbard and Beeby. The elastic property of the glassy system is then studied using the long wavelength limits of the phonon modes. The theoretical computations reproduce much better dispersion curves (both for the longitudinal and transverse phonons) compared to earlier reports and are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental results due to neutron scattering.</p>

The magnetic susceptibility data of the complexes 8 and 9 in the 300 K–20 K temperature range obeys the Curie–Weiss law and exhibits Weiss constants – 50 K and – 100 K, respectively. On lowering the temperature, the effective magnetic moment decreases gradually and is indicative of antiferromagnetic phase transition. The complexes have also been characterized by ES mass spectrometry, infrared (IR), electronic, and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra.</p>

				<page>0017-0021</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Dielectric capacities and losses were measured, in the temperature (50–170$^\circ $C) and frequency (01–100 kHz range), for undoped and acrylic acid (AA) doped ethyl cellulose (EC) films (thickness about 20 $\mu$m) with progressive increase in the concentration of dopant in the polymer matrix. The variation of capacity with temperature is attributed to thermal expansion in the lower temperature region to the orientation of dipolar molecules in the neighbourhood of glass transition temperature ($T_g$) and random thermal motion of molecules above $T_g$. The dielectric losses exhibit a broad peak. Doping with AA is found to affect the magnitude and position of the peak. AA is found to have a two-fold action. Firstly, it enhances the chain mobility and secondly, it increases the dielectric loss by forming charge transfer complexes.</p>

				<title>An instrument for online measurement of structural orientation in translucent polymer sheets</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0023-0026</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>In many applications of polymer materials, a high tensile strength is required. There is a definite correlation between the degree of orientation of molecular chains achieved in the orientation process and the tensile strength obtained. In this work, we describe design and fabrication details of a device, ‘Laser based polymer orientation grader’, for online measurement of the degree of orientation to obtain a high consistent tensile strength as output. This instrument has been designed making skilful use of the optical anisotropic property of the oriented polymer strip. The principle is based on the fact that the spatial distribution of laser light passing through the translucent polymer sheet depends on the degree of orientation of long chain molecules in the sheet. The method has potential online application in monitoring and controlling of anisotropy in manufacturing processes.</p>

				<title>Role of diffusional coherency strain theory in the discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy</title>
				<feature>Metallic Materials</feature>
				<page>0039-0045</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Discontinuous precipitation (DP) occurs in many alloy systems under certain conditions. It is called discontinuous precipitation because precipitation occurs on prior matrix grain boundaries followed by grain boundary movement. The DP nodule consists of alternate lamellae of the precipitate and the matrix respectively. The chemical driving force for DP is one of solute supersaturation. Although solute supersaturation is responsible for precipitation, it has to be coupled with another driving force to explain grain boundary migration. This coupling driving force has been identified to be diffusional coherency strain which has been verified to be active in diffusion induced grain boundary migration and liquid film migration. To test diffusional coherency strain theory for discontinuous precipitation Mg–7Al and Mg–7Al–1Pb alloys were studied. While the fraction transformed was high at 6% in Mg–7Al alloy, it was significantly low at 2% in Mg–7Al–1Pb alloy. The velocity of DP nodules decreased by half in alloy with Pb as compared to the alloy without Pb. Theoretical calculations also predict that the misfit parameter $d_{th}$ decreases with the addition of Pb. These observations are an evidence to the fact that diffusional coherency strain is the most active driving force for the movement of the grain boundaries of the DP nodules during discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy.</p>

				<title>Role of work hardening characteristics of matrix alloys in the strengthening of metal matrix composites</title>
				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0047-0049</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The strengthening of particulate reinforced metal–matrix composites is associated with a high dislocation density in the matrix due to the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the reinforcement and the matrix. While this is valid, the role of work hardening characteristics of the matrix alloys in strengthening of these composites is addressed in the present paper. It is found that commercial purity aluminium which has the lowest work hardening rate exhibits the highest strength increment. This effect is due to increased prismatic punching of dislocations. This relationship of decreasing work hardening rate associated with increasing prismatic punching of dislocations in the order 7075, 2014, 7010, 2024, 6061 and commercial purity aluminium leading to increased strength increments is noted.</p>

The films were deposited at the potential of – 0 8 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) onto the silver substrate. The different preparative parameters such as deposition potential, deposition time were studied and optimized. These films were then oxidized electrochemically at room temperature in an alkaline (1 N KOH) solution, and also at 600$^\circ $C temperature in an oxygen atmosphere. The films showed the superconducting behaviour, with $T_c$  values ranging between 85 K and 96 K, respectively.</p>

				<title>Dehydration transformation in Ca-montmorillonite</title>
				<feature>Clay Materials</feature>
				<page>0061-0067</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The present work deals with the dehydration transformation of Ca-montmorillonite in the temperature range 30$^\circ $–500$^\circ $C. Thermal, infrared (IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were used to describe the thermal transformation. The microstructural and layer disorder parameters like crystallite size, r.m.s. strain ($e^{2\ 1/2}$), variation of interlayer spacing (g), and proportion of planes which were affected by the defect (g), have all been calculated from the (001) basal reflection using the method of variance and Fourier line shape analysis. These investigations revealed that sample underwent transformation from hydrated phase to dehydrated phase at 200$^\circ $C, and as a consequence, its basal spacing collapsed from 16 02 Å (30$^\circ $C) to around 10 Å (200$^\circ $C). This transformation occurred through a wide range of temperature, i.e. within the range 120$^\circ $–200$^\circ $C. The crystallite size was maximum at room temperature (30$^\circ $C), however, the size decreased with increasing temperature in the hydrated phase, whereas the size increased with increasing temperature for the dehydrated phase. The g, $g$ and e$^{2\ 1/2}$ of the hydrated and the dehydrated phase increased and decreased, respectively with increase of heating temperature.</p>

                    <p>An alloy containing Pb–12% Sn–12% Sb with small addition of copper and arsenic was spray deposited employing two different atomization gas pressure and nozzle to substrate distances. The temperature of the spray-deposit was measured during deposition at a distance of 2 and 10 mm above the substrate-deposit interface. Thermal profile data indicated small variation in temperature with time during deposition stage whereas during post deposition stage an exponential decrease in temperature was recorded. Second phase particle size along the thickness of the deposit varied from 4 to 8 $\mu$m compared to 70 to 80 $\mu$m size of these particles in the as cast alloy. Maximum porosity occurred in the section of the deposit near the contact surface of the substrate and also in its peripheral regions. X-ray diffraction analysis exhibited the formation of additional Cu$_2$Sb phase in the spray-deposit and CuSn and Cu$_{3.3}$Sb phases in atomized powders compared to that of the as cast alloy. The microstructural evolution during spray deposition of this alloy is discussed.</p>

X-ray diffraction study of these compositions revealed the formation of single phase spinels. Seebeck coefficient was obtained from thermo emf measurement by keeping constant temperature difference of 10 K across the pellet. The values of Seebeck coefficient were found to be negative showing majority charge carriers of $n$-type, suggesting the mechanism of conduction to be predominantly by electron hopping. The substitution of Nd$^{3+}$ ion, which perhaps resides at the B-site, resulting in a decrease in the Seebeck coefficient. This decrease was assigned to the decrease of population of Fe$^{3+}$ ion at the B-site. The activation energies calculated both from mobility plots and from dc resistivity plots were found comparable. The Fermi energy, $E_F$(0), which was estimated by intrapolation of $E_F–T$ curves to $T$ $=$ 0 K, was found less than the activation energy. This difference was attributed to electron hopping energy.</p>

                    <p>The magnetic behaviour of two ferromagnetic oxides and two ferrimagnetic oxides (ferrites) are compared to study the effect of magnetocrystalline anisotropy on thermal-history-dependence of magnetization of these ordered magnetic systems. All four compounds show thermomagnetic irreversibility ($M_{FC}$ &gt; $M_{ZFC}$) below a certain temperature, $T_{irr}$. The highly anisotropic ferromagnetic oxide, SrRuO$_3$ and the hard ferrite, SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ show sharp peaks below $T_c$ in their $M_{ZFC}(T)$ curves, whereas for the soft ferrite Ni$_{0.8}$Zn$_{0.2}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ and the low anisotropic ferromagnetic oxide La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ only a broad maximum is observed in $M_{ZFC}$, when measured in small magnetic fields. The shapes of the $M_{ZFC}(T)$ curves are inversely-related to the magnitude of the coercivities $(H_c)$ of the compounds in relation to the applied field, and the temperature dependence of $H_c$. $M_{FC}$ and $M_{ZFC}$ are related through the coercivity for all four magnetic systems.</p>

				<page>0103-0107</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A new type of flyash filled PP/PMMA blend has been developed. Structural and thermal properties of flyash (FA) filled polypropylene (PP)/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend system have been determined and analysed. Filled polymer blends were developed on a single screw extruder. Strength and thermal properties of FA filled and unfilled PP/PMMA blends were determined. Addition of flyash imparted dimensional and thermal stability, which has been observed in scanning electron micrographs and in TGA plot. Increase of flyash concentration increased the initial degradation temperature of PP/PMMA blend. The increase of thermal stability has been explained based on increased mechanical interlocking of PP/PMMA chains inside the hollow structure of flyash.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The aim of the work was to optimize the processing parameters for fabricating laminated ceramic composites of Al$_2$O$_3$–Y–PSZ. Composites of different layer thicknesses, starting from 2 mm and going down up to 0.3 mm, were made by hot-pressing. The different types of cracks originating in the composite were studied in detail and the reason behind their formation analysed. The observed main reasons for crack formation were: (i) differential shrinkage in between the co-sintering layers due to their different sintering kinetics, (ii) thermal expansion mismatch, and (iii) a tensile component of the residual stress in the layer under residual compressive stress. After this defect analysis, suitable remedial measures were taken to avoid the crack formation. And finally a laminated composite with fifteen layers of 0.3 mm thickness was made successfully.</p>

The effects of various process parameters, e.g. coating material concentration, time of deposition, applied current, pH of the suspension and concentration of the polymeric dispersant on the deposition efficiency have been studied. The process has been studied using a 2$^3$-factorial design technique of three independent variables; i.e. coating material concentration, applied current, and the time taken to achieve the best combination. The regression equation obtained explains the experimental results satisfactorily.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Some novel results of a combined sequential study of growth spirals on the basal surface of the richly polytypic CdI$_2$ crystals by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are presented and discussed. In confirmation of the known structural data, the STM pictures clearly reveal the value of unit cell $a(=\ b)$ dimension to be equal to 0.428 nm a and the value of the interaxial angle $\gamma $ to be equal to 120$^\circ $. Under the high resolution and magnification achieved in the scanning electron microscope, the growth steps of large heights seen in the optical micrographs are found to have a large number of additional steps of smaller heights existing between any two adjacent large height growth steps. When further seen by a scanning tunneling microscope, which provides still higher resolution, several unit substeps are seen to exist between two consecutive additional steps. The height of each substep is found to be equal to the unit cell height of the underlying polytype. The height of the larger additional steps are found to be integral multiple of the unit cell height. The horizontal distance between two consecutive growth steps is found to be an integral multiple of the lattice parameter $a$. The interspacing of the growth steps of same step height is found to vary at different positions on the same crystal face.</p>

				<title>On the development of an apatitic calcium phosphate bone cement</title>

				<page>0135-0140</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Development of an apatitic calcium phosphate bone cement is reported. 100 $\mu$ Particles of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) were mixed in equimolar ratio to form the cement powder. The wetting medium used was distilled water with Na$_2$HPO$_4$ as accelerator to manipulate the setting time. The cement powder, on wetting with the medium, formed a workable putty. The setting times of the putty were measured using a Vicat type apparatus and the compressive strength was determined with a Universal Testing Machine. The nature of the precipitated cement was analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and energy dispersive electron microprobe (EDAX). The results showed the phase to be apatitic with a calcium–to–phosphorous ratio close to that of hydroxyapatite. The microstructure analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed hydroxyapatite nanocrystallite growth over particulate matrix surface. The structure has an apparent porosity of $\sim$ 52%. There were no appreciable dimensional or thermal changes during setting. The cement passed the $in\ vitro$ toxicological screening (cytotoxicity and haemolysis) tests. Optimization of the cement was done by manipulating the accelerator concentration so that the setting time, hardening time and the compressive strength had clinically relevant values.</p>

                    <p>In view of discrepancies in the available information on the hardness of lithium niobate, a systematic study of the hardness has been carried out. Measurements have been made on two pure lithium niobate crystals with different growth origins, and a Fe-doped sample. The problem of load variation of hardness is examined in detail. The true hardness of LiNbO$_3$ is found to be 630 $\pm$ 30 kg/mm$^2$. The Fe-doped crystal has a larger hardness of 750 $\pm$ 50 kg/mm$^2$.</p>

The detector system is especially optimized for angle dispersive X-ray diffraction set up using rotating anode generator as X-ray source. The performance of this detector was tested by successfully carrying out powder X-ray diffraction measurements on various materials such as intermetallics AuIn$_2$, AuGa$_2$, high $Z$ material Pd and low $Z$ scatterer adamantane (C$_{10}$H$_{16}$) at ambient conditions. Its utility for quick detection of phase transitions at high pressures with diamond anvil cell is demonstrated by reproducing the known pressure induced structural transitions in RbI, KI and a new structural phase transition in AuGa$_2$ above 10 GPa. Various softwares have also been developed to analyze data from this detector.</p>

				 <title>A note on the use of ellipsometry for studying the kinetics of formation of self-assembled monolayers</title>
				<feature>Nanomaterials</feature>
				<page>0159-0163</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Ellipsometry is currently one of the most important techniques for characterization of the deposition and growth mode of ultra thin organic films. However, it is well known that for thicknesses normally encountered in organic monolayer films, as would occur for example in self-assembled monolayers, ellipsometry cannot be used to simultaneously determine the thickness and refractive index of the monolayer film. Current practice is to assume a reasonable value for the film refractive index and calculate an effective ‘ellipsometric thickness’. This communication seeks to show that the alternative approach of assuming a thickness for the monolayer (determined by the length of the molecule) and calculating the effective film refractive index lends itself to easier and more meaningful physical interpretation. The Lorentz–Lorenz formula is then used to transform the effective refractive index into a surface coverage and hence to an effective mass coverage. The methodology advanced is applied to the kinetics of formation of a self-assembled monolayer of a well-studied molecule, octadecanethiol on Au.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Noble metal powders (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd and Ru) have been synthesized by the polyol process in both the nanometer and submicron scales ($sans$ Pd, Pt and Ru). They have been characterized by both microscopic (TEM and SEM) as well as spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR and XPS). Infrared spectroscopy was employed to study the colloid particles in the presence of ethylene glycol and PVP and the results show that the interaction between the organic phase and the metal particles vary according to the particle size. The role of the solvent, ethylene glycol, during the reduction process was also investigated and we observe formation of &gt;C$=$O vibration band after the reduction process implying that the solvent reduces the metal ions thereby getting oxidized. XPS measurements carried out on the colloidal sols have shown the presence of the organic phase adsorbed onto the metal particles.</p>

While M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu members appear to be mixed conductors with a variable electronic contribution to the conductivity, especially at high oxygen partial pressures ($pO_2 \geq$ 1 atm), arising from mixed-valency of the transition metals, the M $=$ Zn(II) phase is a pure oxide ion conductor exhibiting a conductivity ($\sigma \sim$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{–2}$ S/cm at 800$^\circ $C) that is slightly lower than that of LSGM. The lower conductivity of the M $=$ Zn(II) derivative could be due to the preference of Zn(II) for a tetrahedral oxygen coordination.</p>

				<title>A study on fatigue crack growth in dual phase martensitic steel in air environment</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0193-0199</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Dual phase (DP) steel was intercritically annealed at different temperatures from fully martensitic state to achieve martensite plus ferrite, microstructures with martensite contents in the range of 32 to 76%. Fatigue crack growth (FCG) and fracture toughness tests were carried out as per ASTM standards E 647 and E 399, respectively to evaluate the potential of DP steels. The crack growth rates $(da/dN)$ at different stress intensity ranges ($\Delta K$) were determined to obtain the threshold value of stress intensity range ($\Delta K_{th}$). Crack path morphology was studied to determine the influence of microstructure on crack growth characteristics. After the examination of crack tortuosity, the compact tension (CT) specimens were pulled in static mode to determine fracture toughness values. FCG rates decreased and threshold values increased with increase in vol.% martensite in the DP steel. This is attributed to the lower carbon content in the martensite formed at higher intercritical annealing (ICA) temperatures, causing retardation of crack growth rate by crack tip blunting and/or deflection. Roughness induced crack closure was also found to contribute to the improved crack growth resistance at higher levels of martensite content. Scanning electron fractography of DP steel in the near threshold region revealed transgranular cleavage fracture with secondary cracking. Results indicate the possibility that the DP steels may be treated to obtain an excellent combination of strength and fatigue properties.</p>

                    <p>Time differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) measurement on $\rm\underline{Al}$Hf reference sample has shown that a fraction 0.88 of probe nuclei are defect free and are occupying the substitutional sites in fcc Al matrix, and the remaining are associated with Hf solute clusters. Measurements on helium implanted sample indicate the binding of helium associated defects by Hf solute clusters. Isochronal annealing measurements indicate the dissociation of the helium implantation induced defects from Hf solute clusters for annealing treatments beyond 650 K. On comparison of the present results with that reported in $\rm\underline{Cu}$Hf subjected to identical helium implantation, it is inferred that the Hf solute clusters in $\rm\underline{Al}$Hf bind less strongly the helium associated defects than in $\rm\underline{Cu}$Hf.</p>

                    <p>The response of Nomex sheets to some penetrants has been analyzed. The process of moisture uptake depends on the relative humidity (RH) of the ambient atmosphere and the initial characteristics of the polymer. In the case of common laboratory solvents, the uptake by the polymer shows an inverse dependence on the molar volume of the former. Although the calendered and the uncalendered Nomex sheets exhibit an overall similarity in their response to various penetrants, quantitative comparison reveals distinct differences.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Biodegradable polymers represent one of the most significant area of research today. Among these polymers, poly ($\beta$-hydroxy butyrate co $\beta'$-hydroxy valerate) i.e. PHBV have received special attention because of their unique combination of properties. They are perfectly biocompatible, biodegradable polymers and can be processed by any conventional technique. In the present study an attempt has been made to develop the biodegradable blends of PHBV by blending them with ethyl cellulose (EC). Ethyl cellulose has been selected to monitor the biodegradation rate of PHBV and also for making the blends cost effective. The blends are thoroughly characterized for their compatibility, by the measurement of viscosity of blends and through FT-IR. Various applications of PHBV/EC blend in agriculture and pharmaceutical industries are being explored.</p>

                    <p>Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a high performance polymer having low coefficient of friction, good abrasion resistance, good chemical resistance etc. It is used in shipbuilding, textile industries and also in biomedical applications. UHMWPE is processed by powder processing technique because of its high melt viscosity at the processing temperature. Powder processing technique involves compaction of polymeric powder under pressure and sintering of the preforms at temperature above its melting point. In this study, we report our results on compaction and sintering behaviour of two grades of UHMWPE with reference to the powder morphology, sintering temperatures and strength development.</p>

The well defined loss peaks have been observed in the temperature region where measured ac conductivity approaches dc conductivity. These loss peaks are associated with the hopping of the charge carriers. The frequency and temperature dependence of ac conductivity have been qualitatively explained by considering the contribution from two mechanisms; one giving a linear dependence of conductivity on frequency and other having distribution of relaxation times giving rise to broad dielectric loss peak.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Lattice vibrational properties of europium chalcogenides have been investigated at high pressure by using a simple lattice dynamical model theory viz. the three-body force rigid ion model (TRIM) which includes long range three-body interaction arising due to charge transfer effects. The dispersion curves for the four Eu-chalcogenides agree reasonably well with the available experimental data. Variation of LO, TO, LA and TA phonons with pressure have also been studied at the symmetry points of the brillouin zone (BZ) for Euchalcogenides for the first time by using a lattice dynamical model theory. We have also calculated the one phonon density of states and compared them with the first order Raman scattering results. The calculation of one phonon density of states for Eu-chalcogenides has also been extended up to the phase transition pressure. We observed a pronounced shift in phonon spectrum as pressure is increased.</p>

                    <p>Compositions in CaO–Al$_2$O$_3$ system have been prepared by gel–to–crystallite conversion method. Reactive powders of 1 : 2, 1 : 1, 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 of CaO and Al$_2$O$_3$ compositions were obtained by calcining the product at 800–1200$^\circ $C. Fine grained powders were used as refractory cement for joining alumina ceramics. An optimum temperature of 1450$^\circ $C for 4 h produced joints of satisfactory strength. The microstructure and X-ray phase analysis of the fractured joint surface clearly indicate reactive wetting of the alumina ceramics. This wetting enhances the joining of alumina substrates and can be attributed to the formation of Ca$_{12}$Al$_{14}$O$_{33}$ liquid phase. The results are explained by using CaO–Al$_2$O$_3$ phase diagram.</p>

				<title>Optimization of time–temperature schedule for nitridation of silicon compact on the basis of silicon and nitrogen reaction kinetics</title>
				<feature>Nitride Ceramics</feature>
				<page>0249-0253</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A time–temperature schedule for formation of silicon–nitride by direct nitridation of silicon compact was optimized by kinetic study of the reaction, 3Si + 2N$_2$ = Si$_3$N$_4$ at four different temperatures (1250$^\circ $C, 1300$^\circ $C, 1350$^\circ $C and 1400$^\circ $C). From kinetic study, three different temperature schedules were selected each of duration 20 h in the temperature range 1250$^\circ $–1450$^\circ $C, for complete nitridation. Theoretically full nitridation (100% i.e. 66·7% weight gain) was not achieved in the product having no unreacted silicon in the matrix, because impurities in Si powder and loss of material during nitridation would result in 5–10% reduction of weight gain.</p>
                    <p>Green compact of density &lt; 66&#37; was fully nitrided by any one of the three schedules. For compact of density &gt; 66&#37;, the nitridation schedule was maneuvered for complete nitridation. Iron promotes nitridation reaction. Higher weight loss during nitridation of iron doped compact is the main cause of lower nitridation gain compared to undoped compact in the same firing schedule. Iron also enhances the amount of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ phase by formation of low melting FeSi$_x$ phase.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Compositions of the type 3PbO–MgO/ZnO–Nb$_2$O$_5$ were synthesized by the ceramic route at 1000$^\circ $C and sintered at 1200$^\circ $C. Powder X-ray diffraction studies of the 1000$^\circ $C heated products show the presence of the cubic pyrochlore and the columbite (Mg/ZnNb$_2$O$_6$) type phase in the ratio of 3 : 1 for all possible combinations of MgO and ZnO. Further heating at 1200$^\circ $C led to a decrease in the cubic pyrochlore phase and an increase in the columbite phase by around 10&#37;. Compacted pellets sintered further showed the appearance of the perovskite phase. Similar compositions synthesized using the KCl–NaCl molten salt method at 900$^\circ $C for 6 h gave a significant amount of the cubic perovskite related phase of the type Pb(Mg/Zn)$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$O$_3$ for all compositions containing MgO. The amount of the perovskite phase was nearly 55&#37; for the Mg rich compositions and decreased with increase in Zn content, the pure Zn composition yielding mainly the cubic pyrochlore phase. On sintering these phases at 1000$^\circ $C the perovskite phase content decreased. The dielectric constant of the composite materials formed by the ceramic route was in the region of 14 to 20 and varied little with frequency. The composites obtained by the molten salt method, however, showed much larger dielectric constants in the region 40–150 at 500 kHz for various compositions. The dielectric loss tangent of these composites were lower by an order (0·005–0·03 at 500 kHz) compared to the ceramic route.</p>

                    <p>Precursor solutions of cobalt/nickel incorporated nano-grain zirconia films were prepared from aquo-organic solutions of zirconium oxychloride octahydrate and corresponding transition metal nitrate. The films were deposited onto silica glass substrate by the dipping technique. Annealing was made at different temperatures from 450$^\circ $C to 1200$^\circ $C $\pm$ 5$^\circ $C in air atmosphere. The range of thickness of the films baked at 450$^\circ $C was 1800–1870 Å. For cobalt system Co$_3$O$_4$ was formed initially at 450$^\circ $C which gradually transformed to alpha cobalt and next to cubic cobalt along with a non-stoichiometric compound (Zr$_{0·71}$Co$_{0·23}$O$_{0·06}$) with increasing annealing temperature. On the other hand, for nickel system nickel metal of nano-size was observed in the nano-grain zirconia film matrix at 450$^\circ $C. By increasing annealing temperature to 1200$^\circ $C, a compound, ZrNi$_4$O, was formed which was found to be stable for $\sim$ 30 days.</p>

                    <p>The specific heats of superconducting HoBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7–\delta}$ (T$_c \cong $ 92 K) have been theoretically investigated in the temperature domain 70 $\leq$ T $\leq$ 110 K. The bosonic (phonons) contribution to the specific heat is estimated from Debye model in the harmonic approximation for high temperature expansion (T &gt; $\theta_D$/2$\pi$) using the moments of the phonon density of states. The fermionic constituent as the electronic specific heat is deduced using a suitable trial function above and below T$_c$. As a next step the contribution of specific heat by charge oscillations (plasmons) are obtained. The theoretical results from bosonic and fermionic terms are then compared with the experimental results. We find that the specific heats from electronic as well as plasmon term are only a fraction of lattice specific heat and in particular, plasmons do not influence the thermal conduction significantly. The implications of the above analysis are discussed.</p>

				<title>A test for diffusional coherency strain hypothesis in the discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy</title>

				<page>0295-0299</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Discontinuous precipitation (DP) occurs in many alloy systems under certain conditions. Although solute supersaturation is the chemical driving force for DP, this has to be coupled with another driving force for grain boundary migration. This was identified to be diffusional coherency strain ahead of the moving boundary in the case of diffusion induced grain boundary migration (DIGM) and liquid film migration (LFM). In the present work, the validity of diffusional coherency strain hypothesis is verified in Mg–Al alloy, which exhibits discontinuous precipitation. Samples were tested with an applied stress simultaneously with discontinuous precipitation and it was found that the velocity of the boundaries both parallel and transverse to the stress axis obeys the model for diffusional coherency strain. This work can be used as a conclusive evidence for diffusional coherency strain hypothesis for the occurrence of discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloys.</p>

This contains a higher concentration of anionic impurities related to differences in the solubility of the original aluminium salts. The sulfate is retained in the gel to higher temperatures at which its eventual decomposition may lead to the formation of a reactive pore structure which facilitates the nucleation of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$.</p>

				<feature>Material Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0305-0307</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>For preparing calcium ferrite, calcium tris (maleato) ferrate(III) precursor was prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of iron(III) maleate, calcium maleate and maleic acid. Various physico-chemical techniques i.e. TG, DTG, DTA, Mössbauer, XRD, IR etc have been used to study the decomposition behaviour from ambient to 900$^\circ $C and ferrite formation. Three consecutive decomposition steps leading to the formation of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and calcium carbonate have been observed at various stages of thermolysis. In the final stage the ferrite, Ca$_2$Fe$_2$O$_5$, is obtained as a result of solid state reaction between $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and calcium carbonate at 788$^\circ $C, a temperature much lower than for ceramic method. The results have been compared with those of the oxalate precursor.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>A simple and inexpensive ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) technique has been employed to deposit tungsten oxide (WO$_3$) thin films by spraying 2·0 mM aqueous ammonium metatungstate solution onto the amorphous glass substrates kept at 250$^\circ $C. The films were further annealed at 400$^\circ $C for 4 h in air. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was used to determine the crystallinity and to identify the WO$_3$ phases. It was found that the films were sub-stoichiometric, WO$_{3–z}$. To study gas-induced properties, a catalyzing layer of platinum (Pt) was sputtered onto it. The gas-induced electrical and optical properties of Pt/WO$_3$/glass samples were studied and results reported. It was found that electrical resistivity decreased by a factor of 10 within 2 min and stabilized after 15 min, after H$_2$ gas exposure. Similarly the optical transmittance of the samples attenuated from 55&#37; to 10&#37; within 15–20 min. The reversible changes in electrical resistivity and optical transmittance were observed when the samples were exposed to oxygen. The response times and sensitivity of the samples were estimated.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The charge-transport behaviour in pure and chloranil (Chl) doped ethyl cellulose (EC) system has been studied by measuring the dependence of current on field, temperature, electrode material and dopant concentration. The role of doping molecular concentration in the polymer matrix and modification in the conduction characteristics are studied. Lowering of the activation energy due to doping was observed. The current was found to increase with an increase in the chloranil concentration. An explanation for this has been attempted on the basis of formation of molecular aggregates between chloranil molecules and ethoxy groups of ethyl cellulose. It is suggested that chloranil occupies interstitial positions between the polymer chains and assists in carrier transportation by reducing the hopping barriers. The current–voltage characteristics of different samples are analyzed using space charge limited current theory and quantitative information about the transport parameters is derived. The values of effective drift mobility and trapped charge carrier concentration which result in the build up of space charge have been calculated.</p>

Nickel-containing compositions gave higher discharge capacities and smaller hystereses in their charge–discharge profiles which make them more attractive than pristine LiCoO$_2$  as cathode materials in high-energy lithium cells. The lower loss in capacity per cycle for cells with unsubstituted LiCoO$_2$ , as determined from cycling studies up to 25 cycles, makes it more suitable than the substituted ones for long cycle-life cells with low capacity fade.</p>

The results have been analyzed on the basis of structural relaxation equation, Matusita’s equation and modified Kissinger’s equation. The activation energies of structural relaxation lie in between 226 and 593 kJ/mol. The crystallization growth is found to be onedimensional for all compositions. The activation energies of crystallization are found to be 100–136 kJ/mol by Matusita’s equation while 102–139 kJ/mol by modified Kissinger’s equation. The Hruby number (indicator of ease of glass forming and higher stability) is the highest for Se$_{85}$Te$_9$Pb$_6$  glass while S factor (indicator of resistance to devitrification) is highest for Se$_{85}$Te$_7$Pb$_8$  glass at all heating rates in our experiment. Further the highest resistance to devitrification has the highest value of structural activation energy and the activation energy of crystallization is maximum for the most stable glass by both Matusita’s equation and the modified Kissinger’s equation.</p>

                    <p>Synthesis of machinable quality magnesium aluminium silicate (MgO–Al$_2$O$_3$–SiO$_2$) for fabrication of insulators/spacers usable in high voltage applications under high vacuum conditions has been carried out following two different routes i.e. (i) sintering route, and (ii) glass route. A three-stage heating schedule involving calcination, nucleation and crystallization, has been evolved for the preparation of magnesium aluminium silicate (MAS) glass ceramic with MgF$_2$  as a nucleating agent. The effect of sintering temperature on the density of compacted material was studied. Microstructure and machinability of samples obtained from both routes were investigated. They were also characterized for microhardness. Initial studies on material obtained by glass route reveal that these samples are superior to those obtained from sintered route in respect of their high voltage breakdown strength and outgassing behaviour. Outgassing rate of 10$^{–9}$ Torr l s$^{–1}$ cm$^{–2}$  and breakdown strength of 160 kV/cm were obtained. Different types of spacers, lugs, nuts and bolts have been prepared by direct machining of the indigenously developed glass ceramic.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>A hydrogen-storage alloy of the composition Zr$_{0\ 5}$Ti$_{0\ 5}$V$_{0\ 6}$Cr$_{0\ 2}$Ni$_{1\ 2}$ has been investigated for corrosion resistance and hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) in KOH electrolyte of varying concentrations. Activation of the electrode by absorption of hydrogen takes place after prolonged cathodic polarization in the potential range of HER. Prior to activation, the open-circuit potential is about – 0 4 V vs Hg/HgO, OH$^–$ , at which the alloy electrode tends to undergo corrosion with oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) as the conjugate reaction. The corrosion–current density measured from Tafel polarization of ORR is found to be independent of KOH concentration and has an average value of about 30 $\mu$A cm$^{–2}$ . Subsequent to activation, the open circuit potential of the electrode is shifted to about – 0 93 V vs Hg/HgO, OH$^–$ , which is equal to the reversible potential of HER. The exchange current density values measured from Tafel polarization of HER are marginally higher in relation to the values obtained before the electrode is activated. Alternating-current impedance spectra in the Nyquist form contain two overlapped semicircles. The high-frequency semicircle is attributed to the electrode geometry, while the low-frequency semicircle is due to the charge-transfer reaction and double–layer capacitance. The impedance data are analyzed by a non-linear least square curve fitting technique and impedance parameters are evaluated. </p>

                    <p>The corrosion behaviour of two carbon-alloyed intermetallics of composition Fe–28 1Al–2 1C and Fe–27 5Al–3 7C has been studied and compared with that of binary intermetallics. Potentiodynamic polarization studies indicated that the intermetallics exhibited active–passive behaviour in an acidic solution of pH = 1, whereas they exhibited stable passivity in a buffer solution of pH 8 4. Corrosion rates were also obtained by immersion testing. The variation of corrosion rate as a function of time was similar for both the intermetallics. The variation in corrosion rate as a function of time has been explained based on the observed potentiodynamic polarization behaviour. Scanning electron microscopy of corroded surfaces indicated that the carbon-alloyed intermetallics were susceptible to galvanic corrosion, due to the presence of carbides.</p>

				<title>A model for two-step ageing</title>
				<feature>Steels and Alloys</feature>
				<page>0405-0411</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>In commercial practice, two-step ageing is commonly used in Al–Zn–Mg alloys to produce a fine dispersion of $h$ precipitates to accentuate the mechanical properties and resistance to stress corrosion cracking. While this is true in Al–Zn–Mg alloys, two-step ageing leads to inferior properties in Al–Mg–Si alloys. This controversial behaviour in different alloys can be explained by Pashley’s Kinetic model. Pashley’s model addresses the stability of clusters after two-step ageing. In the development of the model, the surface energy term between cluster and matrix is taken into account while the coherency strains between the cluster and matrix are not considered. In the present work, a model is developed which takes into account the coherency strains between cluster and matrix and defines a new stability criterion, inclusive of strain energy term. Experiments were done on AA 7010 aluminium alloy by carrying out a two-step ageing treatment and the results fit the new stability criterion. Thus it is found that the new model for two-step ageing is verified in the case of Al–Zn–Mg alloy.</p>

                    <p>A series of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) of castor oil based polyurethane/polyacrylonitrile (PU/PAN: 80/20, 60/40, 50/50, 40/60 and 20/80) were synthesized by condensation reaction of castor oil with methylene diisocyanate and acrylonitrile, employing benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate (EGDM) as initiator and crosslinkers respectively. The physical, chemical, optical and some of the mechanical properties of PU/PAN were studied. Phase stabilization in IPNs was investigated by wide angle X-ray (WAXS) profile analysis. Variation of crystal size distribution was studied in these polymer networks.</p>

				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0419-0423</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>An appreciable electric current is observed in a system consisting of a polyvinyl formal (PVF) film in a sandwich configuration, in the temperature range 30–110$^\circ $C. The maximum value of the current during first heating is found to be of the order of 10$^{–10}$ A and its thermograms exhibit one transition (i.e. current peak) at around 60$^\circ $C. The position of the current peak in thermal spectrum shifts with the heating rate. A temperature dependence of the open circuit voltage is also observed. The activation energy of the process responsible for the current is determined. The magnitude of the current is more in the case of dissimilar electrode systems. It is proposed that the electric current arising from unpolarized metal–polymer–metal system is a water activated phenomenon, which is influenced by the transitional changes of the polymer.</p>

				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0425-0429</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A siliconized epoxy interpenetrating network (IPN) was synthesized from commercially available DGEBA epoxy resin GY250 (Ciba-Geigy, epoxy equivalent = 182–192, viscosity = 9000–12000 cP) and hydroxyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). PDMS and GY250 were thoroughly mixed at 30$^\circ $C to get the prepolymer. Stoichiometric amounts of PDMS–epoxy prepolymer, $g$-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, aliphatic amine curing agent (HY951), and dibutyltindilaurate catalyst, were thoroughly mixed and cast in a mould after evacuating the entrapped air. The cured material was then taken out and post cured at 70$^\circ $C for 10 h. IPN was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, DSC, TGA and viscosity measurements. Incorporation of PDMS in the epoxy matrix increased the viscosity and lowered the exotherm and pot-life. PDMS in IPN increased $T_g$ , heat-distortion temperature and reduced the percentage weight loss with increase in temperature. Incorporation of PDMS drastically reduced the tensile and flexural strengths and hardness. By reducing the tensile and flexural modulus, the siloxane moiety effectively reduced the internal stress of IPN thereby improving its impact strength and percentage elongation. PDMS increased the electric potential gradient of IPN to withstand without breakdown. An increase in the tracking index and arc resistance of IPN were observed, because of the presence of Si–O–Si, which minimized the possibility of forming carbonized path. Volume and surface resistivities of IPN also increased with the incorporation of PDMS. The siliconized epoxy IPN, with better impact and thermal resistance, may be used in automobile and aerospace applications to withstand high temperature, and mechanical stress. The PDMS–epoxy IPN may be used for encapsulation, high temperature and high voltage application due to their low shrinkage and lesser internal stress. With the improved electrical characteristics, IPN may be used for high performance electrical insulation, insulator housings, and encapsulation to withstand high voltage, moisture, oxidation, chemical attack, biological attack, outdoor weathering, contamination, electrical, mechanical and thermal stress.</p>

                    <p>The system SrBi$_4$Ti$_{4–3x}$Fe$_{4x}$O$_{15}$ belonging to bismuth layer structured ferroelectric (BLSF) materials with $x$ = 0, 0 1 and 0 2 has been prepared through solid-state double sintering method. Increase of iron content in SrBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ resulted in densification of the samples. The normal puckering observed in the sample has been found to decrease and the lattice distortion increased. Dielectric measurements indicate the ferroelectric transition temperature of the samples to be 530$^\circ $C, 560$^\circ $C and 606$^\circ $C. The increase of transition temperature with increasing iron content is correlated with lattice distortion. Conductivity measurements show two slopes and the activation energies have been found to increase with the iron content. Impedance spectroscopy measurements confirm insulating behaviour at lower temperatures. With increase in temperature the samples become conducting and show relaxational effects. The Cole–Cole plots at higher temperatures are found to be semicircles. The relaxation times decrease with the increase of iron content.</p>

Vanadium substitution influences strongly the magnitude of thermal conductivity ($l$) over the entire temperature range. But the nature of $l(T)$ dependence remains similar to that generally observed for HTSCs. The electronic contribution to the total $l$ in the normal state is estimated to be $\sim$ 25%. We have attempted to examine our data, assuming the role of both electrons and phonons in the origin of the $l(T)$ behaviour below $T_c$ . Observed temperature variation of $l(T)$ for the present set of samples could be explained very well assuming this electron + approach. Some of the microscopic quantities estimated from the best-fit parameters give reasonable values.</p>

				<title>Investigations on Tl-2223 thin films fabricated through ultrasonic spray pyrolysis under oxygen deficient conditions</title>

				<abstract>
                    <p>In this paper we have shown that polycrystalline films corresponding to Tl-2223 phase can be grown by employing high thalliation temperatures and short thalliation times. Ultrasonically deposited precursor films corresponding to Ba$_2$Ca$_{2\ 2}$Cu$_{3\ 3}$O$_x$(Ag$_y$) have been thalliated under high vacuum ($\sim$ 10$^{–5}$ torr) at 890$^\circ $C to obtain single phase Tl-2223 films. An off-stoichiometric and unreacted pellet of composition Tl$_{2\ 05}$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_z$  has been used as source of Tl. We have shown that oxygen ambient is not necessary for the growth of Tl-2223 phase. The as-thalliated films have $T_c$’s in the range 123 K $\pm$ 0 70 K. The $T_c$  has been found to be independent of the addition of AgNO$_3$  to the precursor. The zero field transport $J_c$  has been observed to be &gt; 1 2 $\times$ 10$^5$  A/cm$^2$  at 77 K. Near $T_c$  (110 K–122 K), $J_c$  has been observed to follow the power law $J_c$ $(1 – T/T_c)^p , p$ 2. A power law with $p $ 1 4 has been observed for the temperature range 70 K–110 K. An optimum doping of Ag has been observed to induce about 25% increase in $J_c$  and it also leads to uniform and enlarged grain growth. The surface morphology of Ag free samples contains plate like grains having arbitrary shapes. In contrast to this 0 35 Ag doped sample exhibits nearly rectangular plate like grains.</p>

The XRD pattern could be completely indexed with respect to R$\bar{3}$ space group indicating the ordering of vacancy at the divalent cation octahedral sites. The microstructure and bulk thermal expansion coefficient from room temperature to 800$^\circ $C of the sintered samples have been studied. All the samples show very low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), with $x = 0$ samples showing negative expansion. A small substitution of strontium in the pure barium compound changes the sign of CTE. Similarly, $x$ = 1 5 sample (pure strontium) shows a positive CTE and a small substitution of barium changes its sign. $X$ = 1 0 and 1 25 samples have almost constant CTE over the entire temperature range. The low thermal expansion of these samples can be attributed to the ordering of the ions in the crystal structure of these materials.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The theory and practice of oxynitride glass synthesis and property evaluation came into effect since late 70’s. Its importance lies in the fact of its formation at the grain-boundary of synthesized silicon–nitride ceramics with additives. Earlier, heating an oxide glass with NH$_3$  and/or N$_2$  was the route to obtain oxynitride glass. Later on greater amount of nitrogen retention was made possible using AlN or Si$_3$N$_4$ as batch material. Silicate, borate and phosphate systems were studied in isolation or in conjugation. Melting temperature of such glasses varied from 1500–1800$^\circ $C. Different technological developments regarding furnace atmosphere, temperature, compositions etc have been discussed towards a successful synthesis with a thermodynamic approach. Nitrogen content in glass as high as 36 8 eq% has been reported by the application of an overpressure of 30 atm N$_2$. Different physical and chemical properties have been discussed in relation to nitrogen content in glass. Structural aspects have been considered with respect to XPS and IR spectroscopic studies. Finally some points have been highlighted towards some potential applications. </p>

IR results show that this glass consists of [BiO$_3$] units and indicate formation of Bi–F bonds with the addition of LiF. From the ESR spectra of Cu$^{2+}$ ion, the effective g values are found to vary slightly with increasing concentration of fluorine ion. The optical absorption peak corresponding to Cu$^{2+}$ increased linearly with increasing concentration of LiF between 620 nm and 728 nm except at 2 5 mole% of LiF where its value is 729 nm. This peculiar behaviour is attributed to the varying structural coordination of fluorine as the concentration of lithium fluoride is increased. The ionic conductivity measurements indicate that the conduction is due to adiabatic hopping of polarons and the activation energies are found to be temperature and concentration dependent.</p>

                    <p>Immobilization and solidification of hazardous cations like Cs$^{137}$ and Sr$^{90}$ are required while handling the radioactive waste of nuclear power plants. Efforts are on to find a fail proof method of safe disposal of nuclear wastes. In this context, various materials like borosilicate glass, zeolites, cements and synthetic rocks have been tried by several workers. This communication deals with the synthesis, characterization, cesium uptake capacity and leaching behaviour of synthetic alumina-substituted calcium silicate hydroxy hydrate, which are close to that obtained for the natural mineral, 11 Å tobermorite. The synthetic mineral show cation selectivity for Cs${}^+$  in presence of 500–1000 times concentrated solutions of Na$^+$ , K$^+$ , Mg$^{2+}$, Ca$^{2+}$ , Ba$^{2+}$ and Sr$^{2+}$. Although the ordinary portland cement (OPC) which is often used in waste management operations alone holds negligible amounts of Cs$^+$  and Sr$^{2+}$, the addition of alumina-substituted tobermorite to OPC enhances the retention power of cement matrix by drastically lowering the leach rate of cations.</p>

				<page>0521-0527</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Resistance to freezing and thawing of mortar specimens made from sulphoaluminate–belite cement (M–SAB) is compared with that of mortars made from portland cement (M–PC). The results suggest that larger median radius of the pores and total porosity of M–SAB compared to those of M–PC are primarily caused by the rapid setting of the SAB cement. The ‘coarsening’ of pore structure of mortar specimens under action of freezing and thawing is proved by the increase in the macropores portion, median pore radius, and total porosity values. This process is more intense in M–SAB. The effect of the frost attack is confirmed by lower compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity on the one hand and higher absorption capacity, expansion, and crack propagation of M–SAB compared with those of M–PC on the other hand. Besides the decreased frost resistance of M–SAB as compared with that of M–PC, unsatisfactory passivation of steel in M–SAB was found. The reason of this fact is the pH value decrease to less than 11 5 of the M–SAB extract.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) studies have been performed on solution grown cellulose acetate films doped with different concentrations of acrylic acid (AA) prepared at the poling temperatures (40–75$^\circ $C) with poling fields (10–50 kV/cm). The TSDC spectra of pure and AA doped CA films reveal two relaxation peaks at 80$^\circ $C and 180 $\pm$ 2$^\circ $C, having activation energies centred around 0 25 and 0 55 eV. The phenomena of the existence of these current maxima have been analyzed and discussed in terms of the molecular motion of the polar side groups and release of the remaining part of the frozen dipoles by their cooperative motion with adjoining segments of the main polymer chain. The peak currents, released charge and activation energies associated with the peaks are affected by AA doping. The effect of doping with acrylic acid on the discharge current indicates the formation of molecular aggregates.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Irradiation effects of 50 MeV ${}^7$Li$^{+3}$ ion beam induced in bulk PVDF polymer have been studied with respect to their optical, chemical, structural and electrical behaviour by using UV-visible, FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD technique and electrical frequency response using LCR bridge. The ion fluences ranging from 1 27 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ to 2 15 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ ions cm$^{–2}$ have been used to study dose effects of irradiation in PVDF. The recorded UV-visible spectra clearly shows five characteristic peaks at 315, 325, 360, 425 and 600 nm. Due to irradiation, the optical absorption initially decreases but then increases with higher fluences. In the FT-IR spectra, no appreciable change has been observed after irradiation, indicating that this polymer is chemically stable. There is exponential increase in admittance with log of frequency but the effect of irradiation is not quite appreciable. The value of tan $d$ and relaxation frequency are changed appreciably due to irradiation. The diffraction pattern of PVDF indicates that this polymer is in semi-crystalline form; a decrease in the crystallinity and crystallite size has been observed due to irradiation.</p>

The methods studied included the measurement in distilled water, by cathodic protection and by adding inhibitor KI, and all were compared with the wear loss in air. The experiment showed that the pure mechanical wear losses and friction coefficients obtained by the three methods were close to each other and can be used to calculate the various wear components in the study of the interaction of corrosion and wear, but the measurements in distilled water for pure iron and 1045 steel are not recommended due to their corrosion.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The current status of experimental as well as theoretical advances in the understanding of kinetics of structural phase transitions is reviewed. A brief outline of the classification of phase transitions and classical ideas in the theory of kinetics of phase change is presented first. High pressure experimental techniques developed for studying the kinetics of structural transitions are reviewed and the salient features of each technique is brought out. The experimental technique using the diamond anvil cell (DAC) and image processing gets special mention as it promises to impart a new direction to this field. The usefulness of kinetic parameters in understanding the mechanism of a phase transition is examined. Typical examples from the literature are provided to give a flavour for these kind of studies. In conclusion, several open questions are raised which could pave way for future work in this area.</p>

				<title>On the origin of recrystallization textures</title>
				<feature>Review---Phase Transitions</feature>
				<page>0023-0026</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The development of recrystallization textures has been debated for the past 50 years. Essentially the rival theories of evolution of recrystallization textures i.e. oriented nucleation (ON) and oriented growth (OG) has been under dispute. In the ON model, it has been argued that a higher frequency of the special orientation (grains) than random occur, thus accounting for the texture. In the OG model, it has been argued that the specially oriented grains have a high mobility boundary and thus can migrate faster and grow to a larger size as compared to random orientations thus contributing to the final recrystallization texture.</p>
                    <p>In FCC metals and alloys like aluminium, cube orientation [(001) 100 ] is the recrystallization texture component. In the classic OG model, cube orientation is supposed to be misoriented from $S$-orientation [(123) 63$\bar{4}$ ] which is a deformation texture component by a 40$^\circ $ about 111 relationship which is supposed to be a high mobility boundary leading to faster growth of cube grains. Stereographic calculations and analytical calculations are presented in this paper to the effect that the $S$-orientation (123) 63$\bar{4}$ is not misoriented from cube (100) 001 by 40$^\circ $ (111) whereas another deformation texture component (123) 41$\bar{2}$ which is termed the $R$-component is misoriented from cube component by 40$^\circ $ 111 . $R$-component is also seen in deformation textures of aluminium and hence the classic OG model remains valid with respect to the $R$-component.</p>

				<title>Effect of high-energy heavy ion irradiation on the crystallization kinetics of Co-based metallic glasses</title>

				<page>0027-0033</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) is employed to study the crystallization kinetics of irradiated (at three different fluences with high-energy heavy ion; Ni$^{11+}$ of 150 MeV) specimens of two Co-based metallic glasses. It is found that the crystallization process in both the glasses is completed in two phases. The DSC data have been analysed in terms of kinetic parameters viz. activation energy ($E_c$), Avrami exponent ($n$), dimensionality of growth ($m$), using two different theoretical models. The results obtained have been compared with that of virgin samples. The lower activation energy in case of second crystallization occurring at higher temperature indicates the easier nucleation of second phase. The abnormally high value of Avrami exponent in Co–Ni glass indicates very high nucleation rate during first crystallization.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Highly oriented thin films of Fe$_3$O$_4$ were deposited on (100) LaAlO$_3$ substrates by pulsed laser ablation. The structural quality of the films was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The films showed a Verwey transition near 120 K. The films were subjected to 80 keV Ar$^+$ implantation at different ion doses up to a maximum of $6 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$. Ion beam induced modifications in the films were investigated using XRD and resistance vs temperature measurements. Implantation decreases the change in resistance at 120 K and this effect saturates beyond $3 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$. The Verwey transition temperature, $T_V$, shifts towards lower temperatures with increase in ion dose.</p>

The hydrazine released during heating reacts with atmospheric oxygen liberating enormous energy, $$N_2H_4 + O_2 \quad N_2 + H_2O; H_2O = – 621 kJ/mol,$$ which enables to oxidatively decompose the dehydrazinated complex to $\mathbf{g}$-Fe$_2$O$_3$.

                    <p>A new compound, CaMg$_2$Fe$_{16}$O$_{27}$, is synthesized for the first time, in polycrystalline form, using stoichiometric mixture of oxides with standard ceramic technique and characterized by X-ray diffraction. It is found to have a hexagonal W-type structure with lattice parameters $a$ = 5 850 Å and $c$ = 33 156 Å. Electrical studies show that the compound is a semiconductor with energy of activation, $E$ = 0 56 eV. Electrical conductivity results show a transition in the conductivity vs temperature plot near the Curie temperature. The activation energy value obtained for the paramagnetic phase is found to be higher than that of the ferrimagnetic phase. The molar magnetic susceptibility was measured in the temperature range 300–850 K and the results show that the compound is ferrimagnetic at room temperature. The compound also shows hysteresis at 300 K. Paramagnetic nature of the sample above Curie temperature is also studied. The Curie molar constant $C_M$ calculated from the plot of 1/$c_M$ vs $T(K)$ is found to be nearly in agreement with the expected value.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Spinel lithium manganese oxide, LiMn$_2$O$_4$, is beset with problems of capacity fade upon repeated cycling. The loss in capacity upon cycling is attributable to Jahn–Teller distortion and manganese dissolution in the electrolyte in the charged state. One way to circumvent this capacity fade is to introduce other $3d$ transition metal ions in the LiMn$_2$O$_4$ lattice. In this paper, we report on the effect of partial substitution of manganese in the LiMn$_2$O$_4$ phase with copper (II) and chromium (III) ions. It has been shown that the higher octahedral stabilization energy of trivalent chromium imparts greater structural stability to chromium-doped LiMn$_2$O$_4$ spinels. Both copper and chromium reduce the capacity of the spinel in the 4 V region. In terms of its good reversible capacity and ability to sustain cycling with minimal capacity fade, LiCr$_{0\ 1}$Mn$_{1\ 9}$O$_4$  may be considered as a potential cathode material for lithium rechargeable cells.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The dispersion characteristics of commercial Si$_3$N$_4$  powder in aqueous media (deionized water) was studied as a function of pH in the range 2–11. The slip was characterized for its dispersion quality by various experimental techniques like particle size analysis, sedimentation phenomena, viscosity and flow behaviour and zeta potential analysis. The optimum dispersion was found to be in the pH region 9–11 wherein the slurry displayed minimum sedimentation height, minimum viscosity, near Newtonian flow behaviour and maximum zeta potential. The slip is highly agglomerated in the pH range 2–8 as manifested by higher sedimentation height, higher viscosity, lower zeta potential and thixotropic non-Newtonian flow behaviour. The 72 wt% (44 vol.%) Si$_3$N$_4$ slips made at pH = 10 resulted in green bodies having 53–59% of theoretical density after casting into plaster molds.</p>

				<page>0079-0086</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Two types of unidirectional carbon fibre, one of high strength (DHMS) and another of medium strength (VLMS) reinforced vinylester resin composites have been examined for their impact fatigue behaviour over 10$^4$ impact cycles for the first time. The study was conducted using a pendulum type repeated impact apparatus specially designed and constructed for the purpose. A well-defined impact fatigue behaviour (S–N type curve) curve has been demonstrated. It showed a plateau region of 10–10$^2$  cycles immediately below the single cycle impact strength, followed by progressive endurance with decreasing impact loads, culminating in an endurance limit at about 71% and 85% of the single impact strength for DHMS-48 and VLMS-48, respectively. Analysis of the fractured surfaces revealed primary debonding, fibre breakage and pull-out at the tensile zone of the samples and a shear mode of fracture with breakage of fibre bundles at the compressive zone of the samples. The occurrence of a few major macrocracks in the matrix with fibre breakage at the high load–low endurance region and development of multiple microcracks in the matrix, coalescing and fibre breakage at the low-load–high endurance region have been inferred to explain the fatigue behaviour of the composites examined.</p>

                    <p>Glass fibre reinforced vinylester resin composites incorporating varying amounts of fibres (63 5, 55 75, 48 48, 38 63 and 27 48 wt%) were characterized for their mechanical properties both as prepared and after treatment with boiling water for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h. Weights of the samples were found to increase to a saturation at about 8 h with boiling water treatment.</p>
                    <p>In keeping with the composite principle, the mechanical properties improved with fibre loading. However, the properties were relatively inferior when treated with boiling water for longer hours attributing to ingress of moisture by capillary action through the interface between the fibre and the resin matrix. Considering the rates of moisture absorption and correlating with the mechanical properties, it was observed that the deteriorating effects were predominant up to 4 h treatment with boiling water. Estimation of defect concentrations for 63 5 wt% of nascent fibre reinforced composites as well as those composites treated with boiling water for 24 h were 56 93% and 64 16% respectively. Similarly, 27 48 wt% nascent fibre reinforced composites and those composites with boiling water treatment showed the estimation of defect concentrations of 39 94% and 50 55% respectively. SEM study of the fractured surfaces showed heavy fibre pull-out in the tensile zone whilst shear fracture of the fibre bundles was predominant at the compressive zone of the samples tested for flexural strength properties.</p>

				<title>Some numerical approaches of creep, thermal shock, damage and delayed failure of ceramics and refractories</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0100</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Numerical simulation is now very often used to predict the behaviour of components in service conditions. This paper is interested in specific approaches concerning ceramic materials and refractories. Creep can be satisfactorily described by a kinematic hardening, and exhibits different creep rates in tension and compression. Concerning the thermal shock of materials, the numerical approach depends whether or not the material is able to develop a sprayed out damage, leading to micro- or macro-cracking. Finally, delayed failure at high temperature can be considered as a consequence of creep, but the random aspect of failure seriously complicates the numerical models. The lack of experimental data presently limits the calibration and the validation of the numerical models.</p>

				<title>Effect of zirconia addition on the fatigue behaviour of fine grained alumina</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0101-0104</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The fatigue behaviour of fine grained Al$_2$O$_3$ and ZrO$_2$ toughened Al$_2$O$_3$ (ZTA) compositions with 15 vol% ZrO$_2$ (3 mol% Y$_2$O$_3$  stabilized: 3Y-TZP) have been investigated by using three different techniques. Primarily 4-point bending load was employed to generate tension–tension fatigue data under both static and cyclic conditions. The results clearly showed that the materials were susceptible to both the static and cyclic fatigue and the time to failure under cyclic loading was considerably shorter than the equivalent static loads. The repeated indentations at the same spot with varying loads showed a typical fatigue behaviour. In addition, both the materials were subjected to the repeated impact cycles at varying subcritical loads simulating impact fatigue. In all the cases typical fatigue curves were obtained having a progressive endurance at subcritical loads having an endurance limit. The fatigue behaviour of Al$_2$O$_3$  was much improved by the addition of 15 vol% 3Y-TZP, having micro-plasticity contributing towards the cyclic fatigue phenomena of these materials.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Repeated indentation fatigue (RIF) experiments conducted on the same spot of different structural ceramics viz. a hot pressed silicon nitride (HPSN), sintered alumina of two different grain sizes viz. 1 $\mu$m and 25 $\mu$m, and a sintered silicon carbide (SSiC) are reported. The RIF experiments were conducted using a Vicker’s microhardness tester at various loads in the range 1–20 N. Subsequently, the gradual evolution of the damage was characterized using an optical microscope in conjunction with the image analysing technique. The materials were classified in the order of the decreasing resistance against repeated indentation fatigue at the highest applied load of 20 N. It was further shown that there was a strong influence of grain size on the development of resistance against repeated indentation fatigue on the same spot. Finally, the poor performance of the sintered silicon carbide was found out to be linked to its previous thermal history.</p>

				<title>Fracture resistance of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0111-0116</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>An $in$ $situ$ technique for the assessment of fracture resistance employing double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens was developed in the present study. The side-grooved DCB specimens were loaded with pure bending moments in a specially designed and fabricated test fixture which went inside the specimen chamber of a scanning electron microscope. The study as conducted on a 8 mol% fully stabilized cubic phase yttria (Y$_2$O$_3$) stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic. The powder processed sheets were sintered at 1600$^\circ $C for 2 h in a zirconia tube furnace. The mode I applied energy release rate, $G_I$ was determined for both pure YSZ and treated YSZ. Two sets of experiments were conducted for the complete characterization of the ceramics. Three fracture toughness values were determined for the pure and treated ceramics, viz. (i) at the onset of the crack initiation, $G_{ic}$, (ii) at the arrest of a subcritical crack, $G_{ia}$ and (iii) at the onset of the fast fracture, $G_{if}$. Two analyses of the experimental data were carried out, viz. method of extrapolation and statistical analysis. In case of the pure YSZ, a transgranular mode of the stable crack growth was identified to be predominant. The porous coating treatment appeared to have positive effects as the crack initiation resistance increased due to electrode layers. The stable crack growth behaviours of the ceramics were investigated by monitoring the crack growth velocity as a function of applied $G$ values. The results obtained were of direct significance in designing and fabrication of SOFC stacks.</p>

				<title>Fracture toughness and reliability in high-temperature structural ceramics and composites: Prospects and challenges for the 21st Century</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0117-0120</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The importance of high fracture toughness and reliability in Si$_3$N$_4$, and SiC-based structural ceramics and ceramic matrix composites is reviewed. The potential of these ceramics and ceramic matrix composites for high temperature applications in defence and aerospace applications such as gas turbine engines, radomes, and other energy conversion hardware have been well recognized. Numerous investigations were pursued to improve fracture toughness and reliability by incorporating various reinforcements such as particulate-, whisker-, and continuous fibre into Si$_3$N$_4$ and SiC matrices. All toughening mechanisms, e.g. crack deflection, crack branching, crack bridging, etc essentially redistribute stresses at the crack tip and increase the energy needed to propagate a crack through the composite material, thereby resulting in improved fracture toughness and reliability. Because of flaw insensitivity, continuous fibre reinforced ceramic composite (CFCC) was found to have the highest potential for higher operating temperature and longer service conditions. However, the ceramic fibres should display sufficient high temperature strength and creep resistance at service temperatures above 1000$^\circ $C. The greatest challenge to date is the development of high quality ceramic fibres with associate coatings able to maintain their high strength in oxidizing environment at high temperature. In the area of processing, critical issues are preparation of optimum matrix precursors, precursor infiltration into fibre array, and matrix densification at a temperature, where grain crystallization and fibre degradation do not occur. A broad scope of effort is required for improved processing and properties with a better understanding of all candidate composite systems.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The present work deals with the sintering of SiC with a low melting additive by microwave technique. The mechanical characteristics of the products were compared with that of conventionally sintered products. The failure stress of the microwave sintered products, in biaxial flexure, was superior to that of the products made by conventional sintering route in ambient condition. In firing of products by conventionally sintered process, SiC grain gets oxidized producing SiO$_2$ ( 32 wt%) and deteriorates the quality of the product substantially. Partially sintered silicon carbide by such a method is a useful material for a varieties of applications ranging from kiln furniture to membrane material.</p>

The microwave sintering was done with a specially designed applicator placed in a domestic microwave oven operating at a frequency of 2 45 GHz to a maximum power output of 800 Watt. These samples with a wide variation of density and hence, of open pore volume percentage, were characterized in terms of its elastic modulus determination by ultrasonic time of flight measurement using a 15 MHz transducer. In addition, the load dependence of the microhardness was examined for the range of loads 0 1–20 N. Finally, the fracture toughness data ($K_{IC}$) was obtained using the indentation technique.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Jute fibres were subjected to a 5% alkali (NaOH) solution treatment for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h at 30$^\circ $C. An improvement in the crystallinity in the jute fibres increased its modulus by 12%, 68% and 79% after 4, 6 and 8 h of treatment respectively. The tenacity of the fibres improved by 46% after 6 and 8 h treatment and the % breaking strain was reduced by 23% after 8 h treatment. For the 35% composites with 4 h treated fibres, the flexural strength improved from 199 1 MPa to 238 9 MPa by 20%, modulus improved from 11 89 GPa to 14 69 GPa by 23% and laminar shear strength increased from 0 238 MPa to 0 2834 MPa by 19%. On plotting the different values of slopes obtained from the rates of improvement of the flexural strength and modulus, against the NaOH treatment time, two different failure modes were apparent before and after 4 h of treatment. In the first region between 0 and 4 h, fibre pull out was predominant whereas in the second region between 6 and 8 h, transverse fracture occurred with a minimum fibre pull out. This observation was well supported by the SEM investigations of the fracture surfaces.</p>

				<title>Behaviour of $E$-glass fibre reinforced vinylester resin composites under impact fatigue</title>

				<page>0137-0142</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>An impact fatigue study has been made for the first time on 63 5% glass fibre reinforced vinylester resin notched composites. The study was conducted in a pendulum type repeated impact apparatus especially designed and fabricated for determining single and repeated impact strengths. A well-defined impact fatigue (S–N) behaviour, having a progressive endurance below the threshold single cycle impact fracture stress with decreasing applied stress has been demonstrated. Fractographic analysis revealed fracture by primary debonding having fibre breakage and pullout at the tensile zone, but a shear fracture of fibre bundles at the compressive zone of the specimen. The residual strength, modulus and toughness showed retention of the properties at high impact stress levels up to 1000 impacts followed by a sharp drop. Cumulative residual stresses with each number of impacts not withstanding the static fatigue failure at long endurances have been ascribed for the composite failures under the repeated impact stresses.</p>

				<page>0143-0149</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The present work aims at the first ply failure analysis of laminated composite plates with arbitrarily located multiple delaminations subjected to transverse static load as well as impact. The theoretical formulation is based on a simple multiple delamination model. Conventional first order shear deformation is assumed using eight-noded isoparametric quadratic elements to develop the finite element analysis procedure. Composite plates are assumed to contain both single and multiple delaminations. For the case of impact, Newmark time integration algorithm is employed for solving the time dependent multiple equations of the plate and the impactor. Tsai-Wu failure criterion is used to check for failure of the laminate for both the cases. To investigate the first ply failure, parametric studies are made for different cases by varying the size and number of delaminations as well as the stacking sequences and boundary conditions.</p>

The ball on ring biaxial flexure tests were conducted at room temperature as a function of the support ring diameter ( 10–20 mm) and cross head speed (0 1–10 mm min$^{–1}$). In addition, the Weibull modulus data were also determined. The Young’s modulus data was measured using a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) from biaxial flexure tests and was checked out to be comparable to the data obtained independently from the ultrasonic time of flight measurement using a 15 MHz transducer. The microhardness data was obtained for the applied load range of 0 1–20 N. The fracture toughness ($K_{IC}$) data was obtained by the indentation technique at an applied load of 20 N.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>An X-ray powder profile analysis in vanadium pentoxide powder milled in a high energy vibrational ball-mill for different lengths of time (0–250 h), is presented. The strain and size induced broadening of the Bragg reflection for two different crystallographic directions ([001] and [100]) was determined by Warren–Averbach analysis using a pattern-decomposition method assuming a Pseudo–Voigt function. The deformation process caused a decrease in the crystallite size and a saturation of crystallite size of $\sim$ 10 nm was reached after severe milling. The initial stages of milling indicated a propensity of size-broadening due to fracture of the powder particles caused by repeated ball-to-powder impact whereas with increasing milling time microstrain broadening was predominant. WA analysis indicated significant plastic strain along with spatial confinement of the internal strain fields in the crystallite interfaces. Significant strain anisotropy was noticed in the different crystallographic directions. A near-isotropy in the crystallite size value was noticed for materials milled for 200 h and beyond. The column-length distribution function obtained from the size Fourier coefficients progressively narrowed down with the milling time.</p>

The material was tested for indentation fracture toughness at room temperature with a Vicker’s indenter and KIC was found to be 4 42 MPa m which is around 39% higher than the conventional RBSC material. Enhancement in indentation fracture toughness is explained in terms of bowing of propagating cracks through MoSi$_2$/SiC interface which is under high thermal stress arising from the thermal expansion mismatch between MoSi$_2$ and SiC.</p>

Thus, the relative effect of thermal and elastic mismatch on the crack path is expected to change with change in stress intensity. We propose that the crack path in ceramic composites should undergo a transition with the crack being strongly influenced by the thermal mismatch stresses at low stress intensity and elastic mismatch stresses at high stress intensities. Thus, a material in use under different applications each with its own loading conditions is expected to exhibit different crack propagation tendencies which may be reflected in the $v–K$ characteristics of the composite material. In the present work several model composites with different combinations of thermal and elastic mismatch have been considered. Cracks propagating at different sub-critical stress intensities (velocities) were generated by a novel indentation technique. Each indentation was performed at a constant displacement rate and a peak load. A range of displacement rates were used to produce cracks propagating at different velocities. The indentations were made using a Vickers indentor fitted in a universal mechanical testing machine. The crack paths in composites were quantified by stereological technique and the proposed theory was verified.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0191-0195</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Mullite–SiC nanocomposites are synthesized by introducing surface modified sol–gel mullite coated SiC particles in the matrix and densification and associated microstructural features of such precursor are reported. Nanosize SiC (average size 180 nm) surface was first provided with a mullite precursor coating which was characterized by the X-ray analysis and TEM. An average coating thickness of 120 nm was obtained on the SiC particles. The green compacts obtained by cold isostatic pressing were sintered in the range 1500–1700$^\circ $C under pressureless sintering in the N$_2$ atmosphere. The percentage of the theoretical sintered density decreases with increase in SiC content. A maximum sintered density of 97% was achieved for mullite–5 vol.% SiC. The fractograph of the sintered composite showed a highly dense, fine grained microstructure with the SiC particles uniformly distributed along the grains as well as at the grain boundaries inside the mullite. The Vicker’s microhardness of mullite–5 vol.% SiC composite was measured as 1320 kg/mm$^2$ under an applied indentation load of 500 $g$. This value gradually decreased with an increase in SiC content.</p>

                    <p>The preliminary experimental studies on the comparative behaviour of the deformation processes involved in the failure of a commercial, 0 3 mm thick, 18 mm diameter soda–lime–silica glass disks ($G$) and multilayered glass disk–epoxy (GE) as well as glass disk–epoxy–$E$-glass fabric (GEF) composite structures are reported. The failure tests were conducted in a biaxial flexure at room temperature. The epoxy was a commercial resin and the $E$-glass fabric was also commercially obtained as a two-dimensional weave of $E$-glass fibres to an area density of about 242 g m$^{–2}$. The multilayered structures were developed by alternate placement of the glass and reinforcing layers by a hand lay-up technique followed by lamination at an appropriate temperature and pressure. Depending on the number of layers the volume fraction of reinforcement could be varied from about 0 20 for the GE system to about 0 50 for the GEF system. It was observed that the specific failure load (load per unit thickness) was enhanced from a value of about 60 N/mm obtained for the glass to a maximum value of about 100 N/mm for the GE composites and to a maximum of about 70 N/mm for the GEF composite system. Similarly, the displacements at failure ($d$) measured with a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) were also found to be a strongly sensitive function of the type of reinforcement (GE or GEF) as well as the number of layers.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Ceramic based thermal barrier coatings (TBC) are currently considered as a candidate material for advanced stationary gas turbine components. Crack propagation studies under bending are described that were performed on plasma sprayed ZrO$_2$, bonded by MCrAlY layer to Ni base superalloy. The crack propagation behaviour of the coatings at room temperature in as received and oxidized conditions revealed a linear growth of the cracks on the coating till the yield point of the super alloy was reached. High threshold load at the interface between the ceramic layer and the bond coat was required to propagate the crack further into the bond coat. Once the threshold load was surpassed the crack propagated into the brittle bond coat without an appreciable increase in the load. At temperatures of 800$^\circ $C the crack propagated only in the TBC (ceramic layer), as the ductile bond coat offered an attractive sink for the stress relaxation. Effects of bond coat oxidation on crack propagation in the interface region have been examined and are discussed.</p>

The LAS glass crystallized to $b$ spodumene during high-temperature testing. The flow behaviour of LAS glass changed from Newtonian to non-Newtonian due to the presence of crystalline phase. Further, with the addition of 40 vol.% SiC additions, the strain rate sensitivity of flow stress decreased. While the activation energy for flow in LAS was 300 kJ/mole, it increased to 995 kJ/mole with the addition of 40 vol.% SiC reinforcements.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Flyash is incorporated in glass fibre reinforced epoxies to study their response to the filler addition. Low cost of flyash can reduce the overall cost of the component. Only very low volume fractions of filler are investigated in the present study. To obtain further clarification of the observed phenomenon, another abundantly available low cost material, calcium carbonate is incorporated in one set of the specimens. Compressive strength of the material is found to decrease, whereas steep increase in impact strength is observed by introduction of very small quantity of fillers. Specimens containing calcium carbonate are tested for impact properties only. Effect of specimen aspect ratio on the compressive strength values is also studied by testing specimens of three different aspect ratios. Scanning electron microscopic observations are taken to develop a better understanding of the phenomena taking place in the material system at microscopic level.</p>

				<title>A detailed model for defect concentration and dopant activation in GaAs</title>
				<feature>Semiconductors</feature>
				<page>0225-0229</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Defects in semi-insulating (SI) GaAs are especially critical in determining the properties of devices in which dopants are introduced by ion-implantation. The defects in GaAs are native to the material and their concentrations are subsequently modified after ion-implantation and annealing. In this work, we have extended the existing models in the literature by incorporating a large set of defects and using the most recent values for formation energies of these defects. The model includes eight types of point defects, the vacancy of Ga and As, their antisites and interstitials of Ga and As on both sub-lattices, along with carbon related defects always present in SI–GaAs. We have also included Si and related defects when this element is implanted as an $n$-type dopant. All these defects are considered in several charge states allowed by their stability conditions. The model assumes thermodynamic equilibrium between the point defects at an anneal temperature. Then the GaAs wafer is quenched so that the number of defects remain the same as those at the anneal temperature, but redistribution of charges occurs in various charge states. We find that the defect concentrations are extremely sensitive to the crystal stoichiometry, and good agreement with experimental data is shown. However, when we calculate the dopant activation in implanted GaAs, the quantitative agreement with experiments is not adequate. This discrepancy is explained on the basis of available formation energies for the defects.</p>

                    <p>Fatigue properties of a thermomechanically treated 7475 aluminium alloy have been studied in the present investigation. The alloy exhibited superior fatigue life compared to conventional structural aluminium alloys and comparable stage II crack growth rate. It was also noticed that the fatigue crack initiated from a surface grain and the crack extension was dominated by ductile striations. Analysis also revealed that this alloy possessed fracture toughness and tensile properties superior to that noticed with other structural aluminium alloys. Therefore the use of this alloy can safely reduce the overall weight of the aircraft.</p>

Catalytically active polymer containing Ru(III) moieties were synthesized from this polymeric ligand. They were characterized using FTIR, UV-vis, SEM, ESR and TGA. Other physico-chemical properties such as bulk density, surface area, moisture content and swelling behaviour in different solvents were also studied. The polymer bound complex was used to study hydrogenation of 1-hexene to $n$-hexane under mild conditions. Influence of [1-hexene], [catalyst], temperature and nature of the solvent on the rate of the reaction was investigated. A rate expression is proposed based on the observed initial rate data. Recycling efficiency of the catalyst has also been studied.</p>

				<title>Role of Fe substitution and quenching rate on the formation of various quasicrystalline and related phases</title>
				<feature>Quasicrystals</feature>
				<page>0257-0264</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>We have investigated Fe substituted versions of the quasicrystalline (qc) alloy corresponding to Al$_{65}$Cu$_{20}(Cr, Fe)_{15}$ with special reference to the possible occurrence of various quasicrystalline and related phases. Based on the explorations of various compositions it has been found that alloy compositions Al$_{65}$Cu$_{20}$Cr$_{12}$Fe$_3$ and Al$_{65}$Cu$_{20}$Cr$_9$Fe$_6$ exhibit interesting structural phases and features at different quenching rates. At higher quenching rates (wheel speed $\sim$ 25 m/sec) all the alloys exhibit icosahedral phase. For Al$_{65}$Cu$_{20}$Cr$_{12}$Fe$_3$ alloy, however, both the icosahedral and even the decagonal phases get formed at higher quenching rates. At higher quenching rate, alloy having Fe 3 at% exhibits two $bcc$ phases, $bcc$I ($a$ = 8 9 Å) and $bcc$II ($a$ = 15 45 Å). The orientation relationships between icosahedral and crystalline phases are: Mirror plane $\parallel [001]_{bcc\ I}$ and $[351]_{bcc\ II}$, 5-fold $\parallel [113]_{bcc\ II}$ and 3-fold $\parallel [110]_{bcc\ II}$. At lower quenching rate, the alloy having Fe 6 at% exhibits orthorhombic phase ($a$ = 23 6 Å, $b$ = 12 4 Å, $c$ = 20 1 Å). Some prominent orientation relationships of the orthorhombic phase with decagonal phase have also been reported. At lower quenching rate ($\sim$ 10 m/sec), the alloy (Al$_{65}$Cu$_{22}$Cr$_9$Fe$_6$) shows the presence of diffuse scattering of intensities along quasiperiodic direction of the decagonal phase. For making the occurrence of the sheets of intensities intelligible, a model based on the rotation and shift of icosahedra has been put forward.</p>

                    <p>We investigated the optical properties of silicon clusters and Si nanocrystallites using photoluminescence (PL) and Raman scattering technique. Broad luminescence band in the red region was observed from Si-doped SiO$_2$ thin films deposited by co-sputtering of Si and SiO$_2$ on $p$-type Si (100) substrates, annealed in Ar and O$_2$ atmosphere. Nanocrystalline Si particles fabricated by pulsed plasma processing technique showed infrared luminescence from as grown film at room temperature. Raman spectra from these films consisted of broad band superimposed on a sharp line near 516 cm$^{–1}$  whose intensity, frequency, and width depend on the particle sizes arising from the phonon confinement in the nanocrystalline silicon. We also performed PL, Raman and resonantly excited PL measurements on porous silicon film to compare the optical properties of Si nanostructures grown by different techniques.

                    <p>The optical energy gaps of WS$_2$ single crystal were determined from the analysis of the absorption spectrum near the fundamental absorption edge at room temperature using light parallel to $c$-axis incident normally on the basal plane. On the basis of two- and three-dimensional models it was found that both direct and indirect band transitions took place in WS$_2$  and the indirect transition was of the allowed type. The optical energy gaps corresponding to both transitions were determined and the phonon energies associated with the indirect transitions estimated.

				<abstract>
                    <p>25%Al-Zn alloy coating performs better than hot dip galvanized coating and 55%Al-Zn-Si coating with regard to general seawater corrosion protection. This study deals with the interfacial intermetallic layer's growth, which affects considerably the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of 25%Al-Zn alloy coatings, by means of three-factor quadratic regressive orthogonal experiments. The regression equation shows that the intermetallic layer thickness decreases rapidly with increasing content of Si added to the Zn-Al alloy bath, increases with rise in the bath temperature and prolonging dip time. The most effective factor that determined the thickness of intermetallic layer was the amount of Si added to Zn-Al alloy bath, while the effect of bath temperature and dip time on the thickness of intermetallic layer were not very obvious.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>A two-dimensional diffusion based model is developed to describe transformation of austenite into ferrite and pearlite under continuous cooling conditions. The nucleation of ferrite is assumed to occur over grain boundaries and the nucleation of pearlite is assumed to be taking place all over the grain and at growing ferrite–austenite interfaces, when the composition and temperature conditions are favourable. A cellular automaton algorithm, with transformation rules based on this model is used for the growth of ferrite and pearlite. Model predicted results for continuous cooling transformations are verified by comparing the model predicted microstructure features with the experimental measurements for two sets of plain carbon steels of different composition and austenite grain size. Using the model, it is possible to generate results like undercooling to start ferrite and pearlite transformations, which are difficult to obtain experimentally.</p>

                    <p>Compositional and structural information were obtained from an ancient 1600-year old Indian iron using microprobe techniques (EDS, $\mu$XRD and $\mu$PIXE). Several different local locations in the iron matrix and in the entrapped slag inclusions were analyzed. The P content of the metallic iron matrix was very heterogeneous. Lower P contents were observed in the regions near slag inclusions. This was correlated to the dephosphorization capacity of the slag. The crystallized phases identified in the slag inclusions were wüstite and fayalite. The compositions of the slag inclusions were relatively homogeneous.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Chemically beneficiated high silica/alumina iron ore rejects (27–76% Fe$_2$O$_3$) were used to synthesize iron oxides of purity 96–98% with SiO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ ratio reduced to 0 03. The major impurities on chemical beneficiations were Al, Si, and Mn in the range 2–3%. A 99 73% purity Fe$_2$O$_3$ was also prepared by solvent extraction method using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) from the acid extracts of the ore rejects. The magnesium ferrite, MgFe$_2$O$_4$, prepared from these synthetic iron oxides showed high resistivity of 10$^8$ ohm cm. All ferrites showed saturation magnetization, $4pM_s$, in the narrow range of 900–1200 Gauss and the Curie temperature, $T_c$, of all these fell within a small limit of 670 $\pm$ 30 K. All ferrites had low dielectric constants ($e$), 12–15, and low dielectric loss, tan , which decreased with the increase in frequency indicating a normal dielectric dispersion found in ferrites. The presence of insignificant amount of polarizable Fe$^{2+}$ ions can be attributed to their high resistances and low dielectric constants. Impurities inherent in the samples had no marked influence on the electrical properties of the ferrites prepared from the iron ore rejects, suggesting the possibility of formation of ferrite of constant composition, MgFe$_2$O$_4$, of low magnetic and dielectric losses at lower temperatures of 1000$^\circ $C by ceramic technique.</p>

                    <p>Iron oxyhydroxides and hydroxides were synthesized from chemically beneficiated high SiO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ low-grade iron ore (57$\cdot$49% Fe$_2$O$_3$) rejects and heated to get iron oxides of 96–99$\cdot$73% purity. The infrared band positions, isothermal weight loss and thermogravimetric and chemical analysis established the chemical formulas of iron-oxyhydroxides as $\gamma$-FeOOH$\cdot$0$\cdot$3H$_2$O; $\alpha$-FeOOH$\cdot$0$\cdot$2H$_2$O and amorphous FeOOH. The thermal products of all these were $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ excepting that of $\gamma$-FeOOH$\cdot$0$\cdot$3H$_2$O which gave mainly $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and some admixture of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. The hydrazinated iron hydroxides and oxyhydroxides, on the other hand, decomposed autocatalytically to mainly $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. Hydrazine method modifies the thermal decomposition path of the hydroxides. The saturation magnetization, $J_s$, values were found to be in the range 60–71 emu $g^{–1}$ which are close to the reported values for $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. Mechanism of the $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ formation by hydrazine method is discussed.</p>

				<title>Effects and mechanisms of grain refinement in aluminium alloys</title>

				<page>0345-0353</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Grain refinement plays a crucial role in improving characteristics and properties of cast and wrought aluminium alloys. Generally Al–Ti and Al–Ti–B master alloys are added to the aluminium alloys to grain refine the solidified product. The mechanism of grain refinement is of considerable controversy in the scientific literature. The nucleant effects i.e. which particle and its characteristics nucleate $\alpha$-Al, has been the subject of intensive research. Lately the solute effect i.e. the effect of dissolved titanium on grain refinement, has come into forefront of grain refinement research. The present paper attempts to review the literature on the nucleant effects and solute effects on grain refinement and addresses the importance of dissolved titanium in promoting nucleation of $\alpha$-Al on nucleant particles.</p>

				<title>Corrosion behaviour of hot dip zinc and zinc$–$aluminium coatings on steel in seawater</title>
				<feature>Metals and Alloys</feature>
				<page>0355-0360</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A comparative investigation of hot dip Zn–25Al alloy, Zn–55Al–Si and Zn coatings on steel was performed with attention to their corrosion performance in seawater. The results of 2-year exposure testing of these at Zhoushan test site are reported here. In tidal and immersion environments, Zn–25Al alloy coating is several times more durable than zinc coating of double thickness. At long exposure times, corrosion rate for the Zn–25Al alloy coating remains indistinguishable from that for the Zn–55Al–Si coating of similar thickness in tidal zone, and is two to three times lower than the latter in immersion zone. The decrease in tensile strength suggested that galvanized and Zn–55Al–Si coated steel suffer intense pitting corrosion in immersion zone. The electrochemical tests showed that all these coatings provide cathodic protection to the substrate metal; the galvanic potentials are equal to – 1,050, – 1,025 and – 880 mV (SCE) for zinc, Zn–25Al alloy and Zn–55Al–Si coating, respectively, which are adequate to keep the steel inside the immunity region. It is believed that the superior performance of the Zn–25Al alloy coating is due to its optimal combination of the uniform corrosion resistance and pitting corrosion resistance. The inferior corrosion performance by comparison of the Zn coating mainly results from its larger dissolution rate, while the failure of the Zn–55Al–Si coating is probably related to its higher susceptibility to pitting corrosion in seawater.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Soaking temperature, drafting schedule, finish rolling and coiling temperatures all play important roles in processing of low carbon plate and strip. They control the kinetics of various physical and metallurgical processes, viz. austenitization, recrystallization and precipitation behaviour. The final transformed microstructures depend upon these processes and their interaction with each other. In view of increasing cost of input materials, new processing techniques such as recrystallized controlled rolling and warm rolling have been developed for production of plates and thinner hot bands with very good deep drawability respectively. Besides hybrid computer modelling is used for production of strip products with tailor made properties. Although there have been few reviews on low carbon microalloyed steels in the past the present one deals with new developments.</p>

				<page>0373-0378</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A numerical framework has been applied which comprises of a cubic spline based collocation method to determine the solid–liquid interface profile (solidification front) during continuous casting process. The basis function chosen for the collocation algorithm to be employed in this formalism, is a cubic spline interpolation function. An iterative solution methodology has been developed to track the interface profile for copper strand of rectangular transverse section for different casting speeds. It is based on enthalpy conservation criteria at the solidification interface and the trend is found to be in good agreement with the available information in the literature although a point to point mapping of the profile is not practically realizable. The spline based collocation algorithm is found to be a reasonably efficient tool for solidification front tracking process, as a good spatial derivative approximation can be achieved incorporating simple modelling philosophy which is numerically robust and computationally cost effective.</p>

                    <p>The low temperature sintering of MgCuZn ferrite was investigated using the usual ceramic method. The effect of Cu substitution on the properties of MgZn ferrites was also investigated and it was found that the densification of MgCuZn ferrite is dependent upon Cu concentration. The sintered ferrite with a density of 4$\cdot$93 g/cm$^3$ and electrical resistivity &gt; 10$^{11} \Omega$-cm was obtained for the ferrite with 12 mol% Cu at relatively low sintering temperature (910$^\circ $C). The magnetic properties of the ferrites also improved by the Cu substitution. The chip inductors made of the ferrite fired at 910 C with 12 mol% Cu exhibited higher d.c. resistance. From these studies it is concluded that the good quality chip inductor can be obtained using the MgCuZn ferrites.</p>

The lowering of the quinoid absorption in the IR spectra and the upshifting of the N$_{1s}$ envelope in the XPS spectra indicate residual doping in the XPS polymers and thermal characteristic of the polymers provide evidence for hydrogen bonding, which appear to enhance the thermal stability of the homopolymer. These polymers are highly planar and conjugated, with well-developed polaronic features, shown by the XRD, ESR and UV-spectral data. The conductivity, however, is not high and apparently may be due to localization of polaronic charges at the hydrogen-bonding sites and the increased proportion of the insulating methoxy component in the polymer matrix.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>High-energy MeV ions from accelerators are known to produce drastic modifications in polymers. The typical effects include chain scissions, crosslinks, molecular emission and double bond formation. Poly(methyl methacrylate) was doped with Fe(III) and irradiated with 95 MeV O$^{7+}$ ions. ${}^{57}$Fe-Mössbauer studies were done on the doped samples before and after irradiation. Before irradiation, no Mössbauer absorption was observed. The irradiated samples showed a good Mössbauer absorption, which seems to indicate that there is a significant interaction between the metal ion and the polymer matrix. Two possibilities exist at these doses ($\sim$ 22 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ ions/cm): Fe(III) ions may be bridging the various polymer segments through crosslinking or amorphization of the sample leading to Fe–C bonding. Studies of FTIR, conductivity and glass transition temperatures on these samples support these observations.</p>

                    <p>Schottky barriers of Ag, Al, Ni–($n$)CdTe structures have been prepared and studied. The films were prepared by rf sputtering and doped with Cd metal. Diode ideality factor of these junctions are greater than unity and barrier height varies from 0$\cdot$6–0$\cdot$7 eV and are affected by room illumination. Photovoltaic effect of these junctions was very poor and fill factor below 0$\cdot$4. Low doping concentration, high defect density, presence of an interfacial layer and presence of high series resistance are perceived to affect the $J–V$ characteristic.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>With the aim of developing an ideal bone graft, a new bone grafting material was developed using deglued bone, chitosan and gelatin. Deglued bone (DGB) which is a by-product of bone glue industries and has the close crystallographic similarities of hydroxyapatite was used as main component in the preparation of bone implant. Chitosan was prepared from the exoskeleton of prawn (Pinaeus indicus, family Crustaceae) which is a by-product of seafood industries. Chitosan gives toughness to the product and do not allow the DGB particles to wither away when the implant is placed in the defect. Gelatin was used as binder for the preparation of DGB–chitosan composite. The DGB, chitosan and DGB–chitosan–gelatin composite, which were prepared in the laboratory, were analysed for their physicochemical properties by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy studies.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Cholesterol (C$_{27}$H$_{46}$O) is the most abundant and best-known steroid in the animal kingdom. The $in\ vitro$ crystallization of this important biomaterial has been attempted by few researchers. Here we are reporting crystallization of pure cholesterol monohydrate crystals in gel medium. It is found that the morphology of the crystals depends on various parameters. The effect of solvent has been studied in detail. The different morphologies observed are fibrous, needle, platelet, dendrite etc. Micro topographical studies have been made and it is found that the crystals grow, at least in the last stage, by spreading of layers. However, at initial stage microcrystals formed and developed into dendrite or needle forms. These one-dimensional crystals developed into platelets and finally thickened. Further studies reveal that micro impurities play a vital role in the development of these crystals as seen by dissolution figures on the crystals. These crystals are characterized by using the XRD and IR spectroscopic methods.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Experiments on the growth of mixed rare earth (didymium$—$a combination of La, Nd, Pr and Sm) molybdates in silica gel medium are reported. The optimum conditions conducive for the growth of these crystals are described and discussed. Concentration programming is reported to enhance the size of crystals by two-fold; the maximum size obtained being about 1 mm$^3$. EDAX results suggest the crystals to be heptamolybdates of type R$_2$Mo$_7$O$_{24}$, bearing composition La$_{1\ 23}$Nd$_{0\ 43}$Pr$_{0\ 29}$ Sm$_{0\ 05}$Mo$_7$O$_{24}$. The didymium molybdate crystals assume morphologies corresponding to those of spherulites, platelets, cuboids and coalesced crystals. Twinned structure in didymium molybdate crystals are also reported. It is explained that spherulitic morphologies result from aggregates of crystals joining in a spherical envelope. It is suggested that the crystals of didymium molybdates grow by two-dimensional spreading and piling up of layers.</p>

The forced convection and absence of conducting support to ampoule showed improvement in crystal quality of as grown ingots. Crystals showed preferred orientation and self-seeding. Results on interface shape and crystallinity of ingots were found to be in good agreement with the experiments.</p>

                    <p>Dielectric properties such as dielectric constant ($\mathbf{e}$) and dielectric loss tangent (tan&#8364;$\mathbf{d}$) of mixed Mn–Zn–Er ferrites having the compositional formula Mn$_{0\ 58}$Zn$_{0\ 37}$Fe$_{2\ 05–x}$Er$_x$O$_4$ (where $x$ = 0 2, 0 4, 0 6, 0 8 and 1 0) were measured at room temperature in the frequency range 1–13 MHz using a HP 4192A impedance analyser. Plots of dielectric constant ($\mathbf{e}$) vs frequency show a normal dielectric behaviour of spinel ferrites. The frequency dependence of dielectric loss tangent (tan $\mathbf{d}$) was found to be abnormal, giving a peak at certain frequency for all mixed Mn–Zn–Er ferrites. A qualitative explanation is given for the composition and frequency dependence of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent. Plots of dielectric constant vs temperature have shown a transition near the Curie temperature for all the samples of Mn–Zn–Er ferrites. However, Mn$_{0\ 58}$Zn$_{0\ 37}$Er$_{1\ 0}$Fe$_{1\ 05}$O$_4$ does not show a transition.

The particles were characterized with X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and magnetic measurements. The particles are found to be stable under ambient conditions indefinitely. The coercivity values of the Co and Ni particles are $\sim$ 50% higher compared to the corresponding bulk values.

				<abstract>
                    <p>In this paper we have reported investigations on the effect of simultaneous substitution of Bi and Tl at the H$g$ site in the oxygen deficient H$g$O$_\mathbf{d}$ layer of H$g$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\mathbf{d}}$ cuprate superconductor. Bulk polycrystalline samples have been prepared by the two-step solid state reaction process (precursor route). It has been observed that the as grown H$g$Bi$_{0\ 2–x}$Tl$_x$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\mathbf{d}}$ (with $x$ = 0 00, 0 05, 0 10, 0 15, 0 20) corresponds to the 1223 phase. It has been found that the Tc varies with the average cationic size &lt;$R_d$&gt; of the dopantcations. The optimum $T_c$ of $\sim$ 131 K has been found for the composition H$g$Bi$_{0\ 15}$Tl$_{0\ 05}$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\mathbf{d}}$. This composition leads to the average dopant cation size of $\sim$ 1 108 Å which is very close to the size of H$g^{2+}$($\sim$ 1 11 Å). The microstructure for H$g$Bi$_{0\ 15}$Tl$_{0\ 05}$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\mathbf{d}}$ has been found to be most dense and this phase exhibits the highest stability. The $J_c$ of the optimum material H$g$Bi$_{0\ 15}$Tl$_{0\ 05}$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\mathbf{d}}$ is found to be $\sim$ 1 29 $\times$ 10$^3$ A/cm$^2$ at 77 K.</p>

				<title>Physical and chemical response of 70 MeV carbon ion irradiated Kapton-H polymer</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0529-0534</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Physical and chemical responses of 70 MeV carbon ion irradiated Kapton-H polymer were studied by using UV-visible, FTIR and XRD techniques. The ion fluences ranging from 9 3 $\times$ 10$^{11}$–9 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ ions cm$^{–2}$ were used. Recorded UV-visible spectra clearly showed a decrease in absorption initially with fluence, but for the higher fluences it showed a recovery characteristic. A decrease in band-gap energy of 0 07 eV was observed. The FTIR analysis indicated the high resistance to radiation induced degradation of polymer. The diffraction pattern of Kapton-H indicates that this polymer is semi-crystalline in its nature. In case of irradiated one, there was an average increase of crystallite size by 20%, but diffuse pattern indicates that there was a decrease in crystallinity, which may be attributed to the formation of complex structure induced by the cross-linking of the polymeric chains.</p>

These were characterized with respect to their resistance to chemical reagents and mechanical properties such as tensile strength, per cent elongation and shore A hardness.

				<abstract>
                    <p>Thermal history of droplets associated with gas atomization of melt has been investigated. A mathematical model, based on classical theory of heterogeneous nucleation and volume separation of nucleants among droplets size distribution, is described to predict undercooling of droplets. Newtonian heat flow condition coupled with velocity dependent heat transfer coefficient is used to obtain cooling rate before and after nucleation of droplets. The results indicate that temperature profile of droplets in the spray during recalescence, segregated and eutectic solidification regimes is dependent on their size and related undercooling. The interface temperature during solidification of undercooled droplets rapidly approaches the liquidus temperature of the alloy with a subsequent decrease in solid–liquid interface velocity. A comparison in cooling rates of atomized powder particles estimated from secondary dendrite arm spacing measurements are observed to be closer to those predicted from the model during segregated solidification regime of large size droplets. </p>

				<title>Possibility of improvement of potentiodynamic method for monitoring corrosion rate of steel reinforcement in concrete</title>

				<page>0555-0558</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Quantitative data on corroding steel reinforcement in reinforced concrete structures are undoubtedly very useful for evaluation of their service life and timely repairs. The method of electrode potential measurement is a convenient and simple test for this purpose, but it provides no quantitative data on corrosion rate and only information regarding active or passive state of steel reinforcement can be obtained. We show here the possibility of obtaining quantitative data on degree of corrosion of steel reinforcement by a potentiodynamic method. The developed method is based on experimentally estimated mathematical relation between the results of potentiodynamic method and degree of corrosion of steel reinforcement. It is possible to calculate the degree of corrosion of steel reinforcement using this mathematical relation and the measured values of current density by the potentiodynamic method.</p>

                    <p>Nanocomposites of polypyrrole and iron oxide were prepared using simultaneous gelation and polymerization processes. Varied amounts of pyrrole monomer were added to a solution containing iron nitrate as precursor and 2-methoxy ethanol as solvent. The presence of oxide and polypyrrole was confirmed by using X-ray and FTIR techniques. Some of these nanocomposites exhibited magnetic behaviour. SEM studies of powders indicated presence of nanosized particles. Electrical conductivity studies of powders showed a slight variation in conductivity for lower concentration of pyrrole, with a sudden increase in conductivity at 15% of pyrrole concentration. A transition from a nonmagnetic to magnetic phase was also observed at the same concentration.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Sm–Ru intermetallic surface alloy films were prepared by vacuum deposition and annealing of rare earth Sm on single crystal Ru(0001) surface. The Ru $3d$ and Sm $3d$ core level spectra clearly show the formation of surface alloy layers. XPS measurements on surface alloy film revealed an induced peak in the Ru $3d$ region at lower binding energy by 1 eV compared to the bulk Ru (elemental) suggesting an electronic effect of alloying and Sm–Ru bond formation. The Sm $3d_{5/2}$ photoemission peak of Sm film consists of strong features characteristic of Sm(II) with electron configuration $4f^6$ $(5d 6s)^2$ and Sm(III) with electron configuration $4f^5$ $(5d 6s)^3$. It is observed that the Sm(II) feature decreases in intensity upon alloy formation with surface Ru atoms. Oxidation of these films with carbon monoxide indicates alloy breakdown due to the oxidation of Sm atoms selectively. Alloy oxidation also shows a clear shift of Sm $3d_{5/2}$ feature.</p>

                    <p>Synthesis of H$g$(Tl)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\mathbf{d}}$ superconducting tapes have been accomplished by annealing the precursor tape, Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (fabricated by doctor blade tape casting technique) in an environment of H$g$(Tl) vapour. Characterization of superconducting HTSC tape sample was carried out through XRD, TEM, SEM and R–T measurements. Surface morphological investigations of the as-synthesized H$g$(Tl)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\mathbf{d}}$ HTSC tapes by scanning electron microscope have shown the occurrence of curious growth characteristics resembling spiral like features. These growth spirals encompass nearly the whole grain suggesting that spiral growth led to the formation of small crystal like grains of superconducting material H$g$(Tl)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\mathbf{d}}$. The likely mechanism for the generation of these screw dislocations has been elucidated in terms of incoherent coalescence of growth fronts formed from H$g$(Tl):1223 and H$g$(Tl):1234 nuclei.</p>

The tube conductors formed by cold isostatic pressing (CIP) of the powders obtained from spray drying method have been made successfully. It was found that Ag addition has not only affected the formation of the desired Bi-2223 phase and the microstructure of these large bulk tube samples thereby influencing on the critical current ($I_c$), it also reduces the contact resistance to minimize the cryogen losses. These variations have been found to be Ag content dependent. An optimized value of 10 wt% Ag has been found to produce the best quality tubes showing reproducible $I_c$ value &gt; 120 Amp at 77 K which is in general a requirement to energies of the cryogen free conventional/HTSC superconducting magnets below 20 K.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Polycrystalline NiZn ferrites with different grain sizes (1 2 $mu$m to 10 2 $\mu$m) were prepared by the usual ceramic method. The magnetic properties were measured at room temperature. The ultrasonic velocity and attenuation were measured on Ni–Zn ferrite by using the pulse transmission method at 1 MHz, in the temperature range 300–600 K. The velocity was found to be slightly sample dependent at room temperature and decreased with increasing temperature, except near the Curie temperature, $T_c$, where a small anomaly was observed. The longitudinal attenuation ($\mathbf{a}_l$) at room temperature was found to be more sample dependent. The temperature variation of ultrasonic longitudinal attenuation exhibited a broad maximum around 400 K and a sharp maximum just below Curie temperature ($T_c$). The above observations were carried out in the demagnetized state. The application of a 380 mT magnetic field allowed us to reach the saturated state of the sample at all the measuring temperatures. The anomaly observed in the thermal variation of velocities (longitudinal and transverse) and attenuation has been qualitatively explained with the help of the temperature variation of the magneto-crystalline anisotropy constant.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>A simple method for the analysis of stainless steel samples is presented which is based on radioisotope excited energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry and does not require any type-standards. Both absorption and enhancement effects have been taken into account in the fundamental parameter method for quantitative analysis and an iterative approach is followed for calculation of concentrations in steel samples. Non-linear least square fitting (NL-LSF) procedures have been used to determine accurately the fluorescent peak intensities. The method has been tested by analysing several CRM standard reference samples and 304 and 316 steel samples assuming as unknown. The EDXRF results have also been compared with the results of analysis of same samples by vacuum emission spark spectrometry (VES). Obtained values for concentration in steel samples match quite well with their certified values.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Detailed studies based on the well established method of Fourier line shape analysis have been made on the X-ray diffraction profile of hexagonal titanium alloy of nominal composition Ti–6 58% Al–3 16% Mo–1 81% Zr–0 08% Fe–0 012% N–0 0078% C. While deformation fault probability, $\mathbf{a}$, has been found to be quite high compared to that of pure titanium, the deformation growth fault parameter, $\mathbf{b}$, shows a negative value ruling out the presence of growth fault in this alloy in the deformed state.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Two bioceramics (Ca–P–O glass and A–W glass ceramic) were produced using conventional methods of ceramic technology. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were used for identifying the phases and 3-point bend test was carried out for the determination of fracture strength of the bioceramics. Biocompatibility of both ceramics was evaluated using animal model experiments. Histological studies showed that A–W glass ceramic implanted in the tibia of rat formed an intimate contact with newly grown bone and provided enough strength to the bone to bear the animal weight. Implants made of Ca–P–O glass was almost fully resorbed and was replaced by new bone. The implants made of both the bioceramics were biocompatible and did not exhibit any kind of adverse effect to the surrounding tissues.</p>

				<feature>Single Crystals</feature>
				<page>0659-0663</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>One of the most pressing issues in the growth of high quality single crystal Cd$_{0\ 96}$Zn$_{0\ 04}$Te material, is to achieve homogenization of the high axial variation of Zn concentration, caused by the larger than unity segregation coefficient of Zn in CdTe. This is achieved in our crystals (i) by thermal annealing of the CdZnTe crystal, which redistributes the as grown Zn distribution by solid state diffusion of Zn (this solid state diffusion of Zn occurs at three stages (a) during the growth when the solidified crystal is near to the melting point temperature, (b) during the post growth annealing of the crystal at a high temperature and (c) during the cooldown to room temperature) and (ii) by the reduction of Zn segregation during the growth stage by enhanced convective mixing of the melt, through a proper choice of ampoule and furnace dimensions. By adopting suitable growth parameters and sufficient post growth annealing it has been possible to grow Cd$_{0\ 96}$Zn$_{0\ 04}$Te crystals, which have nearly 75% of their fraction within 1% Zn concentration variation.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Single crystals of sodium bromate are grown at various supersaturations ranging from 3% to 8%. Surface studies have been carried out on as-grown and etched (111) faces of these crystals. Typical and systematically oriented growth hillocks are observed almost on all the faces. Further dislocation studies are made to understand the growth history of these crystals. These studies suggest that the crystals grow by 2D-growth mechanism. In addition to this, studies are also conducted on the formation of overgrowths and inclusions in these crystals.</p>

                    <p>Stable nanoclusters of Cu were synthesized using Langmuir–Blodgett films of octadecylsuccinic acid (ODSA) as template. The Langmuir–Blodgett films of ODSA formed from subphase containing copper ions were first subjected to sulphidation (S) using sodium sulphide and then hydrogenated (H) using hydrogen gas. Diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy (DIR-UV-vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) used to characterize these films indicated the formation of Cu(0) metallic clusters ranging in size from 3 10 nm.</p>

				<page>0007-0013</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Preliminary results of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating with its novel properties with no toxicity have caused a strong interest of commercial manufacturers of surgical implants. DLC coatings were prepared on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) at room temperature using ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD). It could be shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy that DLC coating prepared by 800 eV CH$^{n+}$ beam bombardment possessed a higher fraction of sp$^3$ bonds in the structure of mixed $sp^3$ + $sp^2$ bonding, resulting in a higher hydrophobicity. The results of the cell attachment tests indicated that DLC coatings exhibited low macrophage attachment and provided desirable surface for the normal cellular growth and morphology of the fibroblasts. At the same time, the number of both neutral granulocytes and platelets adhering to DLC coatings decreased significantly. These findings showed that DLC was a better coating with desirable tissue and blood compatibility.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Ceria stabilized zirconia powders with ceria concentration varying from 6 to 16 mol% were synthesized using spray drying technique. Powders were characterized for their particle size distribution and specific surface area. The dense sintered ceramics fabricated using these powders were characterized for their microstructure, crystallite size and phase composition. The flexural strength, fracture toughness and microhardness of sintered ceramics were measured. High fracture toughness and flexural strength were obtained for sintered bodies with 12 mol% of CeO$_2$. Flexural strength and fracture toughness were dependent on CeO$_2$ concentration, crystallite size and phase composition of sintered bodies. Correlation of data has indicated that the transformable tetragonal phase is the key factor in controlling the fracture toughness and strength of ceramics. It has been demonstrated that the synthesis method is effective to prepare nanocrystalline tetragonal ceria stabilized zirconia powders with improved mechanical properties. Ce–ZrO$_2$ with 20 wt% alumina was also prepared with flexural strength, 1200 MPa and fracture toughness, 9 2 MPa m.</p>

				<title>Surface modification on PMMA : PVDF polyblend: hardening under chemical environment</title>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The influence of chemical environment on polymers include the surface alteration as well as other deep modifications in surface layers. The surface hardening, as an effect of organic liquids on poly(methyl methacrylate): poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PMMA: PVDF), which is one of the few known miscible blends, has been detected using microhardness testing. Organic liquids like acetone, toluene, xylene and benzene were introduced on the surface of blend specimens for different durations. Vickers microhardness ($H_v$) was measured for treated and untreated specimens. The study reveals both hardening and plasticization of specimens at different exposure times. The degree of surface hardening is maximum under acetone treatment. All the specimens exhibit surface hardening at an exposure time of 1 h with all the four liquids. This feature is prominent with longer exposures for specimens with increasing content of PVDF. However, the degree of hardening decreases with the time of exposure in the respective environments. In general, acetone and toluene impart surface hardening, whereas, xylene and benzene soften the specimen. PMMA: PVDF (83 : 17) blend exhibits surface hardening under all the four treatments when compared with the respective untreated specimens.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>This paper reports the dielectric properties of fly ash. The dielectric measurements were performed as a function of frequency and temperature. The sample of fly ash shows almost similar behaviour in the frequency and temperature range studied. The large value of dielectric constant in the typical frequency range is because of orientation polarization and tight binding force between the ions or atoms in the fly ash. The sample of fly ash is of great scientific and technological interest because of its high value of dielectric constant (10$^4$).</p>

Thermogravimetric analysis showed a loss of weight at 683 K from which the decomposition reaction was formulated. Thermal anomalies were found for this crystal at temperatures 200 K, 220 K in the cooling cycle and at temperatures 200 K, 240 K in the heating cycle, respectively which showed that this crystal was associated with first order phase transition.

The fractured surface was characterized by cleavage fracture. In order to clarify the SCC mechanism, the effects of inhibitor KI on SCC behaviour were also included in this paper. A study showed that the inhibition effects of KI on SCC were mainly attributed to the anodic reaction of the corrosion process. The results of strain distribution in front of the crack tip of the fatigue pre-cracked plate specimens in air, in the blank solution (acidic chloride solution without inhibitor KI) and in the solution added with KI measured by speckle interferometry (SPI) support the unified mechanism of SCC and corrosion fatigue cracking (CFC).</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The changes with time in the corrosion rate and corrosion current density on a cast iron electrode in various aqueous salt solutions have been carried out using total immersion test and potentiostatic polarization curves. The concentration of salts taken is expected to be present in potable water. The relative behaviour of these salts towards corrosion has also been studied, which is found to be different from previous studies. The total immersion test parameters viz. weight loss, corrosion rate as well as potentiostatic parameters, open circuit potential, $I_{corr}$, Tafel slopes, corrosion rate, have been calculated by standard methods. Besides these the relative increase in corrosion rate with time as well as the percentage to which corrosion rate should be decreased so as to provide protection towards corrosion have also been calculated. It was found that KCl and NaCl are major contributors than MnSO$_4$, Pb(NO$_3$)$_2$, KI and KBr. The relative increase in corrosion is high in KBr, KI, NaNO$_3$, CaCl$_2$, and less in Pb(NO$_3$)$_2$, NaHCO$_3$ and CaCO$_3$ test solutions. For the reliability of results the data has been statistically analysed.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The Cu$^{2+}$ ion doped silica gel matrices in monolithic shape were prepared by hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). The absorption, transmittance and fluorescence spectra of the gel matrices heat treated at different temperatures were monitored. The loss of water and hydroxyl group from silica network changes the optical properties of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions in the host, noted by the change in colour of monolith and spectral characteristics. The pronounced blue shift observed (700–900 nm to 600–850 nm) for the broad band of the absorption spectra of the samples heated up to 700$^\circ $C is attributed to the ligand field splitting and partial removal of hydroxyl group from the silica matrices. The results indicate broadband filtering effects of the samples in the wavelength region 400–600 nm. Absorption and fluorescence spectra of the glass matrices heated to 1000$^\circ $C confirms the conversion of Cu$^{2+}$ ion to Cu$^+$ ion.</p>

				<title>Preparation of high purity tellurium by zone refining</title>
				<feature>Materials Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0079-0083</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>This paper describes purification process of tellurium metal using zone refining technique under high purity hydrogen gas ambient in normal room environment. Process automation by newly designed stepper motor drive and allied process control instruments circumvent the complexity of electrical motors. It is observed that overall impurities have gone down substantially from 4N+ to 5N5 purity with reference to Fe, Mg, Al, Cr, Zn, Bi and Cu. Removal of selenium is effected by hydrogen, which also serves as carrier gas during zone refining. The selenium in tellurium matrix is found to be below detection limits. The zone temperature, zone length and tilt angle maintained in the experiment are adequate to go down to high purity levels.</p>

				<title>Photoelectronic properties of HgI$_2$ crystals for nuclear radiation detection</title>
				<feature>Materials Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0085-0093</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Photoelectronic properties of red mercuric iodide single crystals, grown from its saturated solution in tetrahydrofuran, have been studied for the wavelength range 450-700 nm at temperatures 80, 110, 175, 235 and 300 K. Various aspects of the optical generation of charge carriers have been discussed. The computer simulation of the room temperature photoconductivity has generated the optimized values of the mobility-lifetime products ($\mu_e\tau_e$ = 5$\cdot$67 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/V, $\mu_h\tau_h$ = 0$\cdot$18 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/V), and surface recombination velocities ($S_e$ = 3$\cdot$2 $\times$ 10$^5$ cm/s, $$_h$ = 4$\cdot$5 $\times$ 10$^5$ cm/s) of the charge carriers in these crystals. The estimated values of the electron and hole drift lengths for typical electric fields suggest that, under the negative electrode illumination, THF $\alpha$-HgI$_2$ crystals have high potential as regards to their use as phptodetectors in most of the scintillation spectrometers.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The characteristics of a magnetic sensor, based on the non-linear electromagnetic response of the weak links present in polycrystalline BPSCCO superconductor are reported. The second harmonic response of the sensor in an alternating magnetic field at 40 kHz and at 77 K being a strong linear function of low d.c. field is utilized for magnetic field sensing. The noise limited resolution of the sensor is found to be 3$\cdot$16 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$ T/$\surd$Hz for $H_{a.c.}$ = 16 G and frequency 40 kHz. The magnetic sensor has been applied for non-destructive detection of various types of flaws in ferromagnetic plates and also for detection of small magnetic inclusions in a non-magnetic matrix. Our results suggest that the 2$f$ response based BPSCCO superconductive magnetometer has potential for its appication in the area of non-destructive evaluation of defects in ferromagnetic materials.</p>

Pressureless sintering of these powders was achieved by addition of boron carbide of 0 5 wt% together with carbon of 1 wt% at 2050$^\circ $C at vacuum (3 mbar) for 15 min. Nearly 99% sintered density was obtained. The mechanism of sintering was studied by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. This study shows that the mechanism is a solid-state sintering process. Polytype transformation from 6H to 4H was observed.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The low thermal expansion ceramic system, Ca$_{1–x}$Sr$_x$Zr$_4$P$_6$O$_{24}$, for the compositions with $x$ = 0, 0 25, 0 50, 0 75 and 1 was synthesized by solid-state reaction. The sintering characteristics were ascertained by bulk density measurements. The fracture surface microstructure examined by scanning electron microscopy showed the average grain size of 2 47 $^\mu$m for all the compositions. The thermal expansion data for these ceramic systems over the temperature range 25–800$^\circ $C is reported. The sinterability of various solid solutions and the hysteresis in dilatometric behaviour are shown to be related to the crystallographic thermal expansion anisotropy. A steady increase in the amount of porosity and critical grain size with increase in $x$ is suggested to explain the observed decrease in the hysteresis.</p>

The ionic conductivity peaks at two concentrations of Al$_2$O$_3$ indicating two percolation thresholds for proton conduction. Two separate experiments were carried out to check the existence of such percolation thresholds viz. the volta battery experiment involving the measurement of e.m.f. of an electrochemical cell with composites of different compositions used as electrolyte and the composition vs conductivity measured by the complex impedance spectroscopy. The presence of two maxima has been attributed to two different percolation thresholds for the two possible mobile protonic species $H^+$ (H$_3$O$^+$) and OH$^–$ arising from the hydrates.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Under the condition of tungsten inert gas shielded welding (TIG) + shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) technology, the microstructure in the welding zone of 9Cr–1Mo–V–Nb (P91) heat-resisting steel is studied by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The test results indicate that when the weld heat input ($E$) of TIG is 8 5 $\sim$ 11 7 kJ/cm and the weld heat input of SMAW is 13 3 $\sim$ 21 0 kJ/cm, the microstructure in the weld metal is composed of austenite and a little amount of $\mathbf{d}$ ferrite. The substructure of austenite is crypto–crystal martensite, which included angle. There are some spot precipitates in the martensite base. TEM analysis indicates that the fine structure in the heat-affected zone is lath martensite. There are some carbides (lattice constant, 1 064 nm) at the boundary of grain as well as inside the grain, most of which are Cr$_{23}$C$_6$ and a little amount of (Fe, Me)$_{23}$C$_6$.</p>

                    <p>The present paper describes the alcohol sensing characteristics of spin coated SnO$_2$ thin film deposited by using sol–gel process. The sensitivity of the film was measured at different temperatures and different concentrations of alcohol at ppm level. Alcohol detection result shows peak sensitivity at 623 K. The variation of sensitivity and ethanol concentration has shown a linear relationship up to 1150 ppm and after that it saturates. The response time measurement of the sensor was also observed and it was found that the response time is 30 sec. The results obtained favour the sol–gel process as a low cost method for the preparation of thin films with a high sensing characteristic.</p>

				<title>Influence of copolymer composition on the transport properties of conducting copolymers: poly(aniline-co-o-anisidine)</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0235-0239</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The effect of different compositions of monomers on the transport properties of copolymers by various techniques such as optical, electrical and magnetic has been investigated and compared with the homopolymers. The UV-visible absorption spectra show a hypsochromic shift with an increase in the o-anisidine content in copolymers indicating a decrease in the extent for conjugation (i.e. an increase in the bandgap). From temperature dependence of electrical conductivity the transport parameters such as charge localization length and average hopping distance are calculated and also the effect of the monomeric composition on the coherence length has been discussed. The magnetic studies show the paramagnetic and diamagnetic nature of homopolymers and copolymers. The X-ray diffraction pattern indicates that the copolymers are of amorphous nature.</p>

The measured values of both thermal conductivity and diffusivity were used to determine the specific heat per unit volume of the said materials in the composition range of investigation. Results indicated that both the values of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increased with the addition of indium at the cost of tellurium whereas the specific heat remained almost constant. This compositional dependence behaviour of the thermal conductivity and diffusivity has been explained in terms of the iono-covalent type of bond which In makes with Se as it is incorporated in the Se–Te glass.</p>

The variation in the actual gap voltage obtained from the $I–\mathcal{z}$ data of the clean tip was used in the calculation. The estimated values of the change in work function, 0$\cdot$16 eV and 0$\cdot$59 eV, for as-deposited and annealed tips, respectively match closely with the reported values. The method is generally applicable to chemically modified metal tips.</p>

				<page>0251-0257</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A comprehensive analysis of size and strain broadened profile shapes in X-ray diffraction line broadening analysis is presented. Both size and strain broadened profiles were assumed to be Voigtian and the derived microstructural parameters (size and strain) were found to be in close agreement with those calculated from model independent Warren–Averbach method. The method is applied to three different alumina samples viz. micron size $\alpha$-alumina ($\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$) prepared by the combustion of aluminium nitrate and urea mixture, annealed samples and commercial $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ sample. It is likely from the present analysis that a significant Gaussian size contribution is related to narrow size distribution observed from the analysis. It has been concluded that present Voigtian analysis is more reliable and may largely replace the earlier simplified integral breadth methods of analysis often used in line broadening analysis.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Ni–Zn ferrite powders were synthesized by self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) method. X-ray diffraction, TEM and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) were used to characterize the phase composition, microstructure and magnetic properties of the combustion products. The effect of the combustion temperature ($T_c$), the major parameter of the SHS process, on particle size, phase composition and magnetic properties of the products was also studied. The results showed that particle size grew with the increasing combustion temperature. The maximum saturation magnetization, $M_s$, increased with combustion temperature indicating the growth of grain size and high degree of ferritization, while residual magnetization, $M_r$, and coercive force, $H_c$, decreased. Compared with other methods, Ni$_{0\cdot35}$Zn$_{0\cdot65}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ ferrite powders with improved magnetic properties can be obtained by SHS at 1000$^\circ $C.</p>

				<title>Crystal structure transformation of TiO2 in presence of Fe$_2$O$_3$ and NiO in air atmosphere</title>
				<feature>Phase Transitions</feature>
				<page>0267-0273</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>TiO$_2$ is produced and marketed in two main grades viz. anatase and rutile. Both anatase and rutile have their own pigmentry properties and hence cannot be substituted by each other. Pure anatase on heating at higher temperatures undergoes crystallographic rearrangement to form rutile. This transformation in presence of NiO and Fe$_2$O$_3$ under air atmosphere was studied using XRD and SEM. The transformation temperature was found to be reduced much in presence of NiO and Fe$_2$O$_3$ and the extent of lowering was higher for NiO than Fe$_2$O$_3$. The activation energy for this transformation was also calculated. The method of preparation had major influence on the transformation.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The room temperature structure of three compounds belonging to the Aurivillius family ($n =$ 4), ABi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ (A = Ba, Sr or Pb) has been analysed. BaBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ crystallizes in a tetragonal $I4/mmm$ space group whereas SrBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ and PbBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ crystallize in the orthorhombic space group $A2_1am$. The starting model for the Sr and Pb analogues was derived from $ab\ initio$ methods and refined using the Rietveld method. The cations Ba and Sr are disordered over the Bi sites while the Pb cation is found exclusively in the [Bi$_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ layers. The TiO$_6$ octahedra are tilted with the Ti–O bonds forming zigzag chains along the $‘c’$ axis. The displacement of Bi atoms along the $‘a’$ axis might be responsible for ferroelectricity in these compounds. The high temperature X-ray data above $T_c$ indicate no structural transition for A = Ba and Pb while A = Sr transforms to the tetragonal structure.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Hydrotalcite like precursors containing Pd$^{II}$–Mg$^{II}$–Al$^{III}$ with varying molar ratios, (Pd + Mg)/Al $\approx$ 3 and Mg/Pd $\approx$ 750 to 35, were prepared by coprecipitation of metal nitrates at constant pH. Characterization of samples as synthesized and their calcined products by elemental analyses, powder XRD, TG–DTA, FT–IR spectroscopy, TPR and N$_2$ physisorption indicated a well crystalline hydrotalcite like structure with incorporation of Pd$^{2+}$ in the brucite layers. Thermal decomposition of hydrotalcite precursors at intermediate temperatures led to amorphous mixed oxides, Pd/MgAl(O), which on reduction yielded bi-functional catalyst, Pd$^\circ $/MgAl(O). The resultant catalysts with acid, base and hydrogenating sites, were highly active and selective for one-step synthesis of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) from acetone and hydrogen. The results showed an optimal balance between acid-base and metallic sites were required to increase the selectivity of MIBK and stability of the catalysts.</p>
