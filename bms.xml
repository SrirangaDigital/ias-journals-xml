				<title>Sol–gel processing of carbidic glasses</title>
				<feature>Glasses</feature>
				<page>0001-0004</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbon incorporation into the silicate network results in the formation of rigid carbidic glasses with improved physical, mechanical and thermal properties. This generated great interest in the development of these heteroatom structured materials through different processing routes. In the present studies, sol–gel processing has been used to prepare silicon based glasses, especially oxycarbides through organic–inorganic hybrid gels by hydrolysis–condensation reactions in silicon alkoxides, 1,4-butanediol and furfuryl alcohol with an aim to introduce Si–C linkages in the precursors at sol level. The incorporation of these linkages has been studied using IR and NMR spectroscopy. These bonds, so introduced, are maintained throughout the processing, especially during pyrolysis to high temperatures. In FFA–TEOS system, copolymerization with optimized mol ratio of the two results in resinous mass. This precursor on pyrolysis to $1000^\circ $C results in Si–O–C type amorphous solid black mass. XRD studies on the materials heated to $1400^\circ $C exhibit presence of crystalline Si–C and cristobalites in amorphous Si–O–C mass. In organic–inorganic gel system, the pyrolysed mass exhibits phase stability up to much higher temperatures. The carbidic materials so produced have been found to exhibit good resistance against oxidation at $1000^\circ $C.</p>

				<title>Collective modes in Ca$_{70}$Mg$_{30}$ glass</title>
				<feature>Glasses</feature>
				<page>0005-0009</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The self-consistent phonon scheme given by Takeno and Goda, involving multiple scattering and phonon eigen frequencies which are expressed in terms of many-body correlation functions of atoms as well as of interatomic potential in the solids, has been used to generate the collective modes in the Ca$_{70}$Mg$_{30}$ glass. A model potential is proposed to describe the effective interaction in the glass. Three different forms of the local field correction functions viz. Hartree, Taylor and Ichimaru and Utsumi are used to examine relative influence of exchange and correlation effects. The phonon frequencies of the longitudinal and transverse modes are computed employing the theoretical formulation of Hubbard and Beeby. The elastic property of the glassy system is then studied using the long wavelength limits of the phonon modes. The theoretical computations reproduce much better dispersion curves (both for the longitudinal and transverse phonons) compared to earlier reports and are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental results due to neutron scattering.</p>

The magnetic susceptibility data of the complexes 8 and 9 in the 300 K–20 K temperature range obeys the Curie–Weiss law and exhibits Weiss constants – 50 K and – 100 K, respectively. On lowering the temperature, the effective magnetic moment decreases gradually and is indicative of antiferromagnetic phase transition. The complexes have also been characterized by ES mass spectrometry, infrared (IR), electronic, and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Dielectric capacities and losses were measured, in the temperature (50–170$^\circ $C) and frequency (01–100 kHz range), for undoped and acrylic acid (AA) doped ethyl cellulose (EC) films (thickness about 20 $\mu$m) with progressive increase in the concentration of dopant in the polymer matrix. The variation of capacity with temperature is attributed to thermal expansion in the lower temperature region to the orientation of dipolar molecules in the neighbourhood of glass transition temperature ($T_g$) and random thermal motion of molecules above $T_g$. The dielectric losses exhibit a broad peak. Doping with AA is found to affect the magnitude and position of the peak. AA is found to have a two-fold action. Firstly, it enhances the chain mobility and secondly, it increases the dielectric loss by forming charge transfer complexes.</p>

				<title>An instrument for online measurement of structural orientation in translucent polymer sheets</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0023-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In many applications of polymer materials, a high tensile strength is required. There is a definite correlation between the degree of orientation of molecular chains achieved in the orientation process and the tensile strength obtained. In this work, we describe design and fabrication details of a device, ‘Laser based polymer orientation grader’, for online measurement of the degree of orientation to obtain a high consistent tensile strength as output. This instrument has been designed making skilful use of the optical anisotropic property of the oriented polymer strip. The principle is based on the fact that the spatial distribution of laser light passing through the translucent polymer sheet depends on the degree of orientation of long chain molecules in the sheet. The method has potential online application in monitoring and controlling of anisotropy in manufacturing processes.</p>

				<title>Role of diffusional coherency strain theory in the discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy</title>
				<feature>Metallic Materials</feature>
				<page>0039-0045</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Discontinuous precipitation (DP) occurs in many alloy systems under certain conditions. It is called discontinuous precipitation because precipitation occurs on prior matrix grain boundaries followed by grain boundary movement. The DP nodule consists of alternate lamellae of the precipitate and the matrix respectively. The chemical driving force for DP is one of solute supersaturation. Although solute supersaturation is responsible for precipitation, it has to be coupled with another driving force to explain grain boundary migration. This coupling driving force has been identified to be diffusional coherency strain which has been verified to be active in diffusion induced grain boundary migration and liquid film migration.</p>
					<p>To test diffusional coherency strain theory for discontinuous precipitation Mg–7Al and Mg–7Al–1Pb alloys were studied. While the fraction transformed was high at 6% in Mg–7Al alloy, it was significantly low at 2% in Mg–7Al–1Pb alloy. The velocity of DP nodules decreased by half in alloy with Pb as compared to the alloy without Pb. Theoretical calculations also predict that the misfit parameter $\delta_{th}$ decreases with the addition of Pb. These observations are an evidence to the fact that diffusional coherency strain is the most active driving force for the movement of the grain boundaries of the DP nodules during discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy.</p>

				<title>Role of work hardening characteristics of matrix alloys in the strengthening of metal matrix composites</title>
				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0047-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The strengthening of particulate reinforced metal–matrix composites is associated with a high dislocation density in the matrix due to the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the reinforcement and the matrix. While this is valid, the role of work hardening characteristics of the matrix alloys in strengthening of these composites is addressed in the present paper. It is found that commercial purity aluminium which has the lowest work hardening rate exhibits the highest strength increment. This effect is due to increased prismatic punching of dislocations. This relationship of decreasing work hardening rate associated with increasing prismatic punching of dislocations in the order 7075, 2014, 7010, 2024, 6061 and commercial purity aluminium leading to increased strength increments is noted.</p>

					<p>Oriented La$_{0\cdot75}$Ca$_{0\cdot25}$MnO$_3$ (LCMO) films have been deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method on (100) LaAlO$_3$ substrates. Ion-beam technique is used to introduce a very low concentration of ${}^{57}$Fe in LCMO film. The deposited films were subjected to 100 keV ${}^{57}$Fe$^+$ implantation with different fluences at room temperature. The main motivation of this work was to study the influence of implantation on the transport mechanism in materials exhibiting colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) property. It is observed that Fe implantation drastically affects the structural and magneto-transport properties. The samples were characterized using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy (CEMS) and resistance temperature ($R–T$) measurements.</p>

				<page>0061-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present work deals with the dehydration transformation of Ca-montmorillonite in the temperature range 30$^\circ $–500$^\circ $C. Thermal, infrared (IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were used to describe the thermal transformation. The microstructural and layer disorder parameters like crystallite size, r.m.s. strain ($\langle e^2\rangle^{1/2}$), variation of interlayer spacing ($g$), and proportion of planes which were affected by the defect ($\gamma$), have all been calculated from the (001) basal reflection using the method of variance and Fourier line shape analysis. These investigations revealed that sample underwent transformation from hydrated phase to dehydrated phase at 200$^\circ $C, and as a consequence, its basal spacing collapsed from 16$\cdot$02 Å (30$^\circ $C) to around 10 Å (200$^\circ $C). This transformation occurred through a wide range of temperature, i.e. within the range 120$^\circ $–200$^\circ $C. The crystallite size was maximum at room temperature (30$^\circ $C), however, the size decreased with increasing temperature in the hydrated phase, whereas the size increased with increasing temperature for the dehydrated phase. The $g$, $\gamma$ and $\langle e^2\rangle^{1/2}$ of the hydrated and the dehydrated phase increased and decreased, respectively with increase of heating temperature.</p>

				<title>Microstructural features induced by spray forming of a ternary Pb–Sn–Sb alloy</title>
				<feature>Materials Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0073-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An alloy containing Pb–12% Sn–12% Sb with small addition of copper and arsenic was spray deposited employing two different atomization gas pressure and nozzle to substrate distances. The temperature of the spray-deposit was measured during deposition at a distance of 2 and 10 mm above the substrate-deposit interface. Thermal profile data indicated small variation in temperature with time during deposition stage whereas during post deposition stage an exponential decrease in temperature was recorded. Second phase particle size along the thickness of the deposit varied from 4 to 8 $\mu$m compared to 70 to 80 $\mu$m size of these particles in the as cast alloy. Maximum porosity occurred in the section of the deposit near the contact surface of the substrate and also in its peripheral regions. X-ray diffraction analysis exhibited the formation of additional Cu$_2$Sb phase in the spray-deposit and CuSn and Cu$_{3\cdot3}$Sb phases in atomized powders compared to that of the as cast alloy. The microstructural evolution during spray deposition of this alloy is discussed.</p>

					<p>Investigations on nucleation thermodynamical parameters are very essential for the successful growth of good quality single crystals from high temperature solution. A theoretical estimation of the nucleation thermodynamical parameters like interfacial energy between the solid Nd123 and its flux BaO–CuO, metastable zone-width, Gibbs free energy, critical energy barrier for nucleation and critical nucleation radius have been calculated from the knowledge of solubility data and by applying the classical nucleation theory.

The lattice parameter is found to increase monotonically with the cadmium content. It is explained in terms of the sizes of component ions. The grain size of the samples increases up to $x =$ 0$\cdot$3 and then it decreases for higher values of $x$. A similar trend is observed in the variation of Ms with Cd$^{2+}$ content. The initial permeability ($\mu_i$) is however found to increase continuously with $x$. The increase in $\mu_i$ is attributed to decrease of anisotropy constant K$_1$ and higher grain size of the samples.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polycrystalline ferrites, Zn$_x$Mg$_{1 – x}$Fe$_{2 – y}$Nd$_y$O$_4$ ($x =$ 0$\cdot$00, 0$\cdot$20, 0$\cdot$40, 0$\cdot$60, 0$\cdot$80 and 1$\cdot$00; $y =$ 0$\cdot$00, 0$\cdot$05 and 0$\cdot$10) were prepared by standard ceramic method. X-ray diffraction study of these compositions revealed the formation of single phase spinels. Seebeck coefficient was obtained from thermo emf measurement by keeping constant temperature difference of 10 K across the pellet. The values of Seebeck coefficient were found to be negative showing majority charge carriers of $n$-type, suggesting the mechanism of conduction to be predominantly by electron hopping. The substitution of Nd$^{3+}$ ion, which perhaps resides at the B-site, resulting in a decrease in the Seebeck coefficient. This decrease was assigned to the decrease of population of Fe$^{3+}$ ion at the B-site. The activation energies calculated both from mobility plots and from dc resistivity plots were found comparable. The Fermi energy, $E_F$(0), which was estimated by intrapolation of $E_F–T$ curves to $T$ $=$ 0 K, was found less than the activation energy. This difference was attributed to electron hopping energy.</p>

				<title>Comparison of the irreversible thermomagnetic behaviour of some ferro- and ferrimagnetic systems</title>
				<feature>Magnetic Materials</feature>
				<page>0097-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The magnetic behaviour of two ferromagnetic oxides and two ferrimagnetic oxides (ferrites) are compared to study the effect of magnetocrystalline anisotropy on thermal-history-dependence of magnetization of these ordered magnetic systems. All four compounds show thermomagnetic irreversibility ($M_{FC}$ &gt; $M_{ZFC}$) below a certain temperature, $T_{irr}$. The highly anisotropic ferromagnetic oxide, SrRuO$_3$ and the hard ferrite, SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ show sharp peaks below $T_c$ in their $M_{ZFC}(T)$ curves, whereas for the soft ferrite Ni$_{0\cdot8}$Zn$_{0\cdot2}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ and the low anisotropic ferromagnetic oxide La$_{0\cdot7}$Ca$_{0\cdot3}$MnO$_3$ only a broad maximum is observed in $M_{ZFC}$, when measured in small magnetic fields. The shapes of the $M_{ZFC}(T)$ curves are inversely-related to the magnitude of the coercivities $(H_c)$ of the compounds in relation to the applied field, and the temperature dependence of $H_c$. $M_{FC}$ and $M_{ZFC}$ are related through the coercivity for all four magnetic systems.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new type of flyash filled PP/PMMA blend has been developed. Structural and thermal properties of flyash (FA) filled polypropylene (PP)/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend system have been determined and analysed. Filled polymer blends were developed on a single screw extruder. Strength and thermal properties of FA filled and unfilled PP/PMMA blends were determined. Addition of flyash imparted dimensional and thermal stability, which has been observed in scanning electron micrographs and in TGA plot. Increase of flyash concentration increased the initial degradation temperature of PP/PMMA blend. The increase of thermal stability has been explained based on increased mechanical interlocking of PP/PMMA chains inside the hollow structure of flyash.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of the work was to optimize the processing parameters for fabricating laminated ceramic composites of Al$_2$O$_3$–Y–PSZ. Composites of different layer thicknesses, starting from 2 mm and going down up to 0$\cdot$3 mm, were made by hot-pressing. The different types of cracks originating in the composite were studied in detail and the reason behind their formation analysed. The observed main reasons for crack formation were:</p>

						<li>differential shrinkage in between the co-sintering layers due to their different sintering kinetics,</li>
						<li>thermal expansion mismatch, and</li>
						<li>a tensile component of the residual stress in the layer under residual compressive stress.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>After this defect analysis, suitable remedial measures were taken to avoid the crack formation. And finally a laminated composite with fifteen layers of 0.3 mm thickness was made successfully.</p>

The effects of various process parameters, e.g. coating material concentration, time of deposition, applied current, pH of the suspension and concentration of the polymeric dispersant on the deposition efficiency have been studied. The process has been studied using a 2$^3$-factorial design technique of three independent variables; i.e. coating material concentration, applied current, and the time taken to achieve the best combination.

				<abstract>
					<p>Some novel results of a combined sequential study of growth spirals on the basal surface of the richly polytypic CdI$_2$ crystals by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are presented and discussed. In confirmation of the known structural data, the STM pictures clearly reveal the value of unit cell $a(=b)$ dimension to be equal to 0$\cdot$428 nm $a$ and the value of the interaxial angle $\gamma $ to be equal to 120$^\circ $. Under the high resolution and magnification achieved in the scanning electron microscope, the growth steps of large heights seen in the optical micrographs are found to have a large number of additional steps of smaller heights existing between any two adjacent large height growth steps. When further seen by a scanning tunneling microscope, which provides still higher resolution, several unit substeps are seen to exist between two consecutive additional steps. The height of each substep is found to be equal to the unit cell height of the underlying polytype. The height of the larger additional steps are found to be integral multiple of the unit cell height. The horizontal distance between two consecutive growth steps is found to be an integral multiple of the lattice parameter $a$. The interspacing of the growth steps of same step height is found to vary at different positions on the same crystal face.</p>

				<title>On the development of an apatitic calcium phosphate bone cement</title>
				<feature>Biomaterials</feature>
				<page>0135-0140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Development of an apatitic calcium phosphate bone cement is reported. 100 $\mu$ Particles of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) were mixed in equimolar ratio to form the cement powder. The wetting medium used was distilled water with Na$_2$HPO$_4$ as accelerator to manipulate the setting time. The cement powder, on wetting with the medium, formed a workable putty. The setting times of the putty were measured using a Vicat type apparatus and the compressive strength was determined with a Universal Testing Machine. The nature of the precipitated cement was analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and energy dispersive electron microprobe (EDAX). The results showed the phase to be apatitic with a calcium–to–phosphorous ratio close to that of hydroxyapatite. The microstructure analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed hydroxyapatite nanocrystallite growth over particulate matrix surface. The structure has an apparent porosity of $\sim$ 52%. There were no appreciable dimensional or thermal changes during setting. The cement passed the $in\ vitro$ toxicological screening (cytotoxicity and haemolysis) tests. Optimization of the cement was done by manipulating the accelerator concentration so that the setting time, hardening time and the compressive strength had clinically relevant values.</p>

					<p>Mass spectrometric analysis of gases evolved during thermal decomposition of divalent metal hydroxides, hydroxysalts and hydrotalcites show that all these compounds undergo dehydration in the temperature range 30 &lt; T &lt; 220$^\circ $C followed by decomposition at temperatures above 250$^\circ $C. The latter step involves simultaneous deanation and dehydroxylation of the layers. Our observations conclusively prove that alternative mechanisms which envisage CO$_2$ evolution due to deanation at lower temperatures proposed by Kanezaki to be wrong.</p>

				<feature>Mechanical Properties</feature>
				<page>0147-0150</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In view of discrepancies in the available information on the hardness of lithium niobate, a systematic study of the hardness has been carried out. Measurements have been made on two pure lithium niobate crystals with different growth origins, and a Fe-doped sample. The problem of load variation of hardness is examined in detail. The true hardness of LiNbO$_3$ is found to be 630 $\pm$ 30 kg/mm$^2$. The Fe-doped crystal has a larger hardness of 750 $\pm$ 50 kg/mm$^2$.</p>

				<feature>Instrumentation</feature>
				<page>0151-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Details of a two-dimensional X-ray area detector developed using a charge coupled device, a image intensifier and a fibre optic taper are given. The detector system is especially optimized for angle dispersive X-ray diffraction set up using rotating anode generator as X-ray source. The performance of this detector was tested by successfully carrying out powder X-ray diffraction measurements on various materials such as intermetallics AuIn$_2$, AuGa$_2$, high $Z$ material Pd and low $Z$ scatterer adamantane (C$_{10}$H$_{16}$) at ambient conditions. Its utility for quick detection of phase transitions at high pressures with diamond anvil cell is demonstrated by reproducing the known pressure induced structural transitions in RbI, KI and a new structural phase transition in AuGa$_2$ above 10 GPa. Various softwares have also been developed to analyze data from this detector.</p>

					<p>The thermoluminescence (TL) properties of raw and annealed feldspar have been studied for their use in gamma dosimetry. The raw gamma exposed feldspar shows glow peaks at 120$^\circ $C and 319$^\circ $C. Gamma dose beyond 500 cGy can be measured without any significant fading even after 40 days of termination of exposure. The annealed feldspar shows a glow peak at 120$^\circ $C after gamma exposure. This peak can be used to measure gamma doses beyond 25 cGy when the TL is measured after 24 h from termination of exposure.</p>

				 <title>A note on the use of ellipsometry for studying the kinetics of formation of self-assembled monolayers</title>
				<feature>Nanomaterials</feature>
				<page>0159-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ellipsometry is currently one of the most important techniques for characterization of the deposition and growth mode of ultra thin organic films. However, it is well known that for thicknesses normally encountered in organic monolayer films, as would occur for example in self-assembled monolayers, ellipsometry cannot be used to simultaneously determine the thickness and refractive index of the monolayer film. Current practice is to assume a reasonable value for the film refractive index and calculate an effective ‘ellipsometric thickness’. This communication seeks to show that the alternative approach of assuming a thickness for the monolayer (determined by the length of the molecule) and calculating the effective film refractive index lends itself to easier and more meaningful physical interpretation. The Lorentz–Lorenz formula is then used to transform the effective refractive index into a surface coverage and hence to an effective mass coverage. The methodology advanced is applied to the kinetics of formation of a self-assembled monolayer of a well-studied molecule, octadecanethiol on Au.</p>

				<title>Study of interaction of ethylene glycol/PVP phase on noble metal powders prepared by polyol process</title>
				<feature>Nanomaterials</feature>
				<page>0165-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Noble metal powders (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd and Ru) have been synthesized by the polyol process in both the nanometer and submicron scales ($sans$ Pd, Pt and Ru). They have been characterized by both microscopic (TEM and SEM) as well as spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR and XPS). Infrared spectroscopy was employed to study the colloid particles in the presence of ethylene glycol and PVP and the results show that the interaction between the organic phase and the metal particles vary according to the particle size. The role of the solvent, ethylene glycol, during the reduction process was also investigated and we observe formation of &gt;C$=$O vibration band after the reduction process implying that the solvent reduces the metal ions thereby getting oxidized. XPS measurements carried out on the colloidal sols have shown the presence of the organic phase adsorbed onto the metal particles.</p>

					<p>Perovskite oxides of the general formula, La$_{0\cdot9}$Sr$_{0\cdot1}$Ga$_{0\cdot8}$M$_{0\cdot2}$O$_{3–\delta}$ for M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn, have been prepared and investigated. All the oxides exhibit high electrical conductivities ($\sigma \sim$ 10$^{–2}$ S/cm at 800$^\circ $C) comparable to that of the best perovskite oxide ion conductor, La$_{0\cdot9}$Sr$_{0\cdot1}$Ga$_{0\cdot8}$Mg$_{0\cdot2}$O$_{2\cdot85}$ (LSGM) ($\sigma \sim$ 8 $\times$ 10$^{–2}$ S/cm at 800$^\circ $C). While M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu members appear to be mixed conductors with a variable electronic contribution to the conductivity, especially at high oxygen partial pressures ($pO_2 \geq$ 1 atm), arising from mixed-valency of the transition metals, the M $=$ Zn(II) phase is a pure oxide ion conductor exhibiting a conductivity ($\sigma \sim$ 1$\cdot$5 $\times$ 10$^{–2}$ S/cm at 800$^\circ $C) that is slightly lower than that of LSGM. The lower conductivity of the M $=$ Zn(II) derivative could be due to the preference of Zn(II) for a tetrahedral oxygen coordination.</p>

				<title>A study on fatigue crack growth in dual phase martensitic steel in air environment</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0193-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dual phase (DP) steel was intercritically annealed at different temperatures from fully martensitic state to achieve martensite plus ferrite, microstructures with martensite contents in the range of 32 to 76%. Fatigue crack growth (FCG) and fracture toughness tests were carried out as per ASTM standards E 647 and E 399, respectively to evaluate the potential of DP steels. The crack growth rates $(da/dN)$ at different stress intensity ranges ($\Delta K$) were determined to obtain the threshold value of stress intensity range ($\Delta K_{th}$). Crack path morphology was studied to determine the influence of microstructure on crack growth characteristics. After the examination of crack tortuosity, the compact tension (CT) specimens were pulled in static mode to determine fracture toughness values. FCG rates decreased and threshold values increased with increase in vol.% martensite in the DP steel. This is attributed to the lower carbon content in the martensite formed at higher intercritical annealing (ICA) temperatures, causing retardation of crack growth rate by crack tip blunting and/or deflection. Roughness induced crack closure was also found to contribute to the improved crack growth resistance at higher levels of martensite content. Scanning electron fractography of DP steel in the near threshold region revealed transgranular cleavage fracture with secondary cracking. Results indicate the possibility that the DP steels may be treated to obtain an excellent combination of strength and fatigue properties.</p>

					<p>Time differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) measurement on $\rm\underline{Al}$Hf reference sample has shown that a fraction 0$\cdot$88 of probe nuclei are defect free and are occupying the substitutional sites in fcc Al matrix, and the remaining are associated with Hf solute clusters. Measurements on helium implanted sample indicate the binding of helium associated defects by Hf solute clusters. Isochronal annealing measurements indicate the dissociation of the helium implantation induced defects from Hf solute clusters for annealing treatments beyond 650 K. On comparison of the present results with that reported in $\rm\underline{Cu}$Hf subjected to identical helium implantation, it is inferred that the Hf solute clusters in $\rm\underline{Al}$Hf bind less strongly the helium associated defects than in $\rm\underline{Cu}$Hf.</p>

				<feature>Semiconducting Materials</feature>
				<page>0207-0210</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>InGaAs/InP quantum wells of widths varying from 19 Å to 150 Å have been grown by MOVPE and the growth temperature optimized using photoluminescence and SIMS. It was thus found that for a 78 Å well the lowest PL linewidth of 12$\cdot$7 meV at 12 K was obtained for growth at 625$^\circ $C. SIMS also showed sharpest interfaces for this temperature compared with growth at 610$^\circ $C and 640$^\circ $C. The well widths determined from PL energies were in good agreement with a growth rate of 8$\cdot$25 Å/s. However, while the barrier widths of 150 Å were in agreement with SIMS results, the well widths from SIMS were found to be much larger, due to a lower sputtering rate of InGaAs compared with InP. Quantitative comparison was made assuming the presence of InAsP and InGaAsP interface layers on either side of the wells and the relative sputtering rates determined.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The response of Nomex sheets to some penetrants has been analyzed. The process of moisture uptake depends on the relative humidity (RH) of the ambient atmosphere and the initial characteristics of the polymer. In the case of common laboratory solvents, the uptake by the polymer shows an inverse dependence on the molar volume of the former. Although the calendered and the uncalendered Nomex sheets exhibit an overall similarity in their response to various penetrants, quantitative comparison reveals distinct differences.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Biodegradable polymers represent one of the most significant area of research today. Among these polymers, poly ($\beta$-hydroxy butyrate co $\beta'$-hydroxy valerate) i.e. PHBV have received special attention because of their unique combination of properties. They are perfectly biocompatible, biodegradable polymers and can be processed by any conventional technique. In the present study an attempt has been made to develop the biodegradable blends of PHBV by blending them with ethyl cellulose (EC). Ethyl cellulose has been selected to monitor the biodegradation rate of PHBV and also for making the blends cost effective. The blends are thoroughly characterized for their compatibility, by the measurement of viscosity of blends and through FT-IR. Various applications of PHBV/EC blend in agriculture and pharmaceutical industries are being explored.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a high performance polymer having low coefficient of friction, good abrasion resistance, good chemical resistance etc. It is used in shipbuilding, textile industries and also in biomedical applications. UHMWPE is processed by powder processing technique because of its high melt viscosity at the processing temperature. Powder processing technique involves compaction of polymeric powder under pressure and sintering of the preforms at temperature above its melting point. In this study, we report our results on compaction and sintering behaviour of two grades of UHMWPE with reference to the powder morphology, sintering temperatures and strength development.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ac conductivity and dielectric constant of poly(N-methyl pyrrole) thin films have been investigated in the temperature range 77–350 K and in the frequency range 10$^2$–10$^6$ Hz. The well defined loss peaks have been observed in the temperature region where measured ac conductivity approaches dc conductivity. These loss peaks are associated with the hopping of the charge carriers. The frequency and temperature dependence of ac conductivity have been qualitatively explained by considering the contribution from two mechanisms; one giving a linear dependence of conductivity on frequency and other having distribution of relaxation times giving rise to broad dielectric loss peak.</p>

				<feature>High Pressure Studies</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Lattice vibrational properties of europium chalcogenides have been investigated at high pressure by using a simple lattice dynamical model theory viz. the three-body force rigid ion model (TRIM) which includes long range three-body interaction arising due to charge transfer effects. The dispersion curves for the four Eu-chalcogenides agree reasonably well with the available experimental data. Variation of LO, TO, LA and TA phonons with pressure have also been studied at the symmetry points of the brillouin zone (BZ) for Euchalcogenides for the first time by using a lattice dynamical model theory. We have also calculated the one phonon density of states and compared them with the first order Raman scattering results. The calculation of one phonon density of states for Eu-chalcogenides has also been extended up to the phase transition pressure. We observed a pronounced shift in phonon spectrum as pressure is increased.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Compositions in CaO–Al$_2$O$_3$ system have been prepared by gel–to–crystallite conversion method. Reactive powders of 1 : 2, 1 : 1, 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 of CaO and Al$_2$O$_3$ compositions were obtained by calcining the product at 800–1200$^\circ $C. Fine grained powders were used as refractory cement for joining alumina ceramics. An optimum temperature of 1450$^\circ $C for 4 h produced joints of satisfactory strength. The microstructure and X-ray phase analysis of the fractured joint surface clearly indicate reactive wetting of the alumina ceramics. This wetting enhances the joining of alumina substrates and can be attributed to the formation of Ca$_{12}$Al$_{14}$O$_{33}$ liquid phase. The results are explained by using CaO–Al$_2$O$_3$ phase diagram.</p>

				<title>Optimization of time–temperature schedule for nitridation of silicon compact on the basis of silicon and nitrogen reaction kinetics</title>
				<feature>Nitride Ceramics</feature>
				<page>0249-0253</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A time–temperature schedule for formation of silicon–nitride by direct nitridation of silicon compact was optimized by kinetic study of the reaction, 3Si + 2N$_2$ = Si$_3$N$_4$ at four different temperatures (1250$^\circ $C, 1300$^\circ $C, 1350$^\circ $C and 1400$^\circ $C). From kinetic study, three different temperature schedules were selected each of duration 20 h in the temperature range 1250$^\circ $–1450$^\circ $C, for complete nitridation. Theoretically full nitridation (100% i.e. 66·7% weight gain) was not achieved in the product having no unreacted silicon in the matrix, because impurities in Si powder and loss of material during nitridation would result in 5–10% reduction of weight gain.</p>
					<p>Green compact of density &lt; 66&#37; was fully nitrided by any one of the three schedules. For compact of density &gt; 66&#37;, the nitridation schedule was maneuvered for complete nitridation. Iron promotes nitridation reaction. Higher weight loss during nitridation of iron doped compact is the main cause of lower nitridation gain compared to undoped compact in the same firing schedule. Iron also enhances the amount of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ phase by formation of low melting FeSi$_x$ phase.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Compositions of the type 3PbO–MgO/ZnO–Nb$_2$O$_5$ were synthesized by the ceramic route at 1000$^\circ $C and sintered at 1200$^\circ $C. Powder X-ray diffraction studies of the 1000$^\circ $C heated products show the presence of the cubic pyrochlore and the columbite (Mg/ZnNb$_2$O$_6$) type phase in the ratio of 3 $:$ 1 for all possible combinations of MgO and ZnO. Further heating at 1200$^\circ $C led to a decrease in the cubic pyrochlore phase and an increase in the columbite phase by around 10&#37;. Compacted pellets sintered further showed the appearance of the perovskite phase. Similar compositions synthesized using the KCl–NaCl molten salt method at 900$^\circ $C for 6 h gave a significant amount of the cubic perovskite related phase of the type Pb(Mg/Zn)$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$O$_3$ for all compositions containing MgO. The amount of the perovskite phase was nearly 55&#37; for the Mg rich compositions and decreased with increase in Zn content, the pure Zn composition yielding mainly the cubic pyrochlore phase. On sintering these phases at 1000$^\circ $C the perovskite phase content decreased. The dielectric constant of the composite materials formed by the ceramic route was in the region of 14 to 20 and varied little with frequency. The composites obtained by the molten salt method, however, showed much larger dielectric constants in the region 40–150 at 500 kHz for various compositions. The dielectric loss tangent of these composites were lower by an order (0·005–0·03 at 500 kHz) compared to the ceramic route.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Precursor solutions of cobalt/nickel incorporated nano-grain zirconia films were prepared from aquo-organic solutions of zirconium oxychloride octahydrate and corresponding transition metal nitrate. The films were deposited onto silica glass substrate by the dipping technique. Annealing was made at different temperatures from 450$^\circ $C to 1200$^\circ $C $\pm$ 5$^\circ $C in air atmosphere. The range of thickness of the films baked at 450$^\circ $C was 1800–1870 Å. For cobalt system Co$_3$O$_4$ was formed initially at 450$^\circ $C which gradually transformed to alpha cobalt and next to cubic cobalt along with a non-stoichiometric compound (Zr$_{0·71}$Co$_{0·23}$O$_{0·06}$) with increasing annealing temperature. On the other hand, for nickel system nickel metal of nano-size was observed in the nano-grain zirconia film matrix at 450$^\circ $C. By increasing annealing temperature to 1200$^\circ $C, a compound, ZrNi$_4$O, was formed which was found to be stable for $\sim$ 30 days.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The specific heats of superconducting HoBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7–\delta}$ (T$_c \cong $ 92 K) have been theoretically investigated in the temperature domain 70 $\leq$ T $\leq$ 110 K. The bosonic (phonons) contribution to the specific heat is estimated from Debye model in the harmonic approximation for high temperature expansion (T &gt; $\theta_D$/2$\pi$) using the moments of the phonon density of states. The fermionic constituent as the electronic specific heat is deduced using a suitable trial function above and below T$_c$. As a next step the contribution of specific heat by charge oscillations (plasmons) are obtained. The theoretical results from bosonic and fermionic terms are then compared with the experimental results. We find that the specific heats from electronic as well as plasmon term are only a fraction of lattice specific heat and in particular, plasmons do not influence the thermal conduction significantly. The implications of the above analysis are discussed.</p>

The variation of dielectric constant ($\varepsilon'$) in the frequency range 100 Hz to 1 MHz and with temperature at constant frequency were studied. The conduction phenomenon was explained on the basis of a small polaronhopping model. Also confirmation of this phenomenon was made with the help of a.c. conductivity measurements. The static value of the magnetoelectric conversion factor, i.e. d.c. (ME)$_H$ was studied as a function of intensity of the magnetic field. The maximum value of ME coefficient was observed for 75&#37; ferroelectric phase composite.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Glass system $x$CuO–(100–$x$) Bi$_2$O$_3$ in the composition range 30–60 mol&#37; of CuO is prepared by melt-quenching technique. The ESR spectra show no hyperfine splittings in parallel part but the peak to peak field width is found to vary with CuO content. The observed $g$ effective values are found to vary with copper oxide. The absence of hyperfine splittings is due to inhomogeneous broadening. The observed IR spectra suggest the presence of Bi–O bonds. The structure is changing from [BiO$_6$] octahedral to [BiO$_3$] pyramidal units with increasing CuO concentration. D.C. electrical conductivity results indicate that the conduction is electron in nature and arises out of adiabatic hopping of polarons. The activation energy is found to be concentration and temperature dependent.</p>

					<p>Dielectric constant $\varepsilon$, loss tan $\delta$, a.c. conductivity $\sigma$ and dielectric breakdown strength of NaF–B$_2$O$_3$ glasses doped with certain transition metal ions (viz. Cu$^{2+}$, VO$^{2+}$, Ti$^{4+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$) are studied in the frequency range 10$^2$–10$^7$ Hz and in the temperature range 30–250$^\circ $C. The values of $^\varepsilon$, tan $\delta$, $\sigma_{a.c.}$ are found to be the highest for Cu$^{2+}$ doped glasses and the lowest for Mn$^{4+}$ doped glasses. Activation energy for a.c. conduction and the value of dielectric breakdown strength are found to be the lowest for Cu$^{2+}$ doped glasses and the highest for Mn$^{4+}$ doped glasses. With the help of infrared spectra, increase in the values of $\varepsilon$ and tan $\delta$ of these glasses with frequency and temperature are identified with space charge polarization. An attempt has been made to explain a.c. conduction phenomenon on the basis of quantum mechanical tunneling model (QMT)/carrier barrier hopping model.</p>

				<title>A test for diffusional coherency strain hypothesis in the discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy</title>
				<feature>Alloys</feature>
				<page>0295-0299</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Discontinuous precipitation (DP) occurs in many alloy systems under certain conditions. Although solute supersaturation is the chemical driving force for DP, this has to be coupled with another driving force for grain boundary migration. This was identified to be diffusional coherency strain ahead of the moving boundary in the case of diffusion induced grain boundary migration (DIGM) and liquid film migration (LFM). In the present work, the validity of diffusional coherency strain hypothesis is verified in Mg–Al alloy, which exhibits discontinuous precipitation. Samples were tested with an applied stress simultaneously with discontinuous precipitation and it was found that the velocity of the boundaries both parallel and transverse to the stress axis obeys the model for diffusional coherency strain. This work can be used as a conclusive evidence for diffusional coherency strain hypothesis for the occurrence of discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloys.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Aluminium hydroxides have been precipitated from various aluminium salts and the differences in their thermal behaviour have been investigated. Pseudoboehmite derived from the nitrate, sulfate and chloride all form $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ at $\sim$ 400$^\circ $C but the formation of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ at 1200$^\circ $C occurs more readily in the material derived from the sulfate. This contains a higher concentration of anionic impurities related to differences in the solubility of the original aluminium salts. The sulfate is retained in the gel to higher temperatures at which its eventual decomposition may lead to the formation of a reactive pore structure which facilitates the nucleation of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>For preparing calcium ferrite, calcium tris (maleato) ferrate(III) precursor was prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of iron(III) maleate, calcium maleate and maleic acid. Various physico-chemical techniques i.e. TG, DTG, DTA, Mössbauer, XRD, IR etc have been used to study the decomposition behaviour from ambient to 900$^\circ $C and ferrite formation. Three consecutive decomposition steps leading to the formation of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and calcium carbonate have been observed at various stages of thermolysis. In the final stage the ferrite, Ca$_2$Fe$_2$O$_5$, is obtained as a result of solid state reaction between $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and calcium carbonate at 788$^\circ $C, a temperature much lower than for ceramic method. The results have been compared with those of the oxalate precursor.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple and inexpensive ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) technique has been employed to deposit tungsten oxide (WO$_3$) thin films by spraying 2·0 mM aqueous ammonium metatungstate solution onto the amorphous glass substrates kept at 250$^\circ $C. The films were further annealed at 400$^\circ $C for 4 h in air. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was used to determine the crystallinity and to identify the WO$_3$ phases. It was found that the films were sub-stoichiometric, WO$_{3–z}$. To study gas-induced properties, a catalyzing layer of platinum (Pt) was sputtered onto it. The gas-induced electrical and optical properties of Pt/WO$_3$/glass samples were studied and results reported. It was found that electrical resistivity decreased by a factor of 10 within 2 min and stabilized after 15 min, after H$_2$ gas exposure. Similarly the optical transmittance of the samples attenuated from 55&#37; to 10&#37; within 15–20 min. The reversible changes in electrical resistivity and optical transmittance were observed when the samples were exposed to oxygen. The response times and sensitivity of the samples were estimated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The charge-transport behaviour in pure and chloranil (Chl) doped ethyl cellulose (EC) system has been studied by measuring the dependence of current on field, temperature, electrode material and dopant concentration. The role of doping molecular concentration in the polymer matrix and modification in the conduction characteristics are studied. Lowering of the activation energy due to doping was observed. The current was found to increase with an increase in the chloranil concentration. An explanation for this has been attempted on the basis of formation of molecular aggregates between chloranil molecules and ethoxy groups of ethyl cellulose. It is suggested that chloranil occupies interstitial positions between the polymer chains and assists in carrier transportation by reducing the hopping barriers. The current–voltage characteristics of different samples are analyzed using space charge limited current theory and quantitative information about the transport parameters is derived. The values of effective drift mobility and trapped charge carrier concentration which result in the build up of space charge have been calculated.</p>

					<p>Solid solutions of compositions LiNi$_y$Co$_{1–y}$O$_2$ ($y$ = 0$\cdot$0, 0$\cdot$1 and 0$\cdot$2) were prepared by solid-state fusion synthesis from carbonate precursors. Material characterization was carried out using XRD. Formation mechanisms of the products are discussed in the light of TG/DTA results. Nickel-containing compositions gave higher discharge capacities and smaller hystereses in their charge–discharge profiles which make them more attractive than pristine LiCoO$_2$  as cathode materials in high-energy lithium cells. The lower loss in capacity per cycle for cells with unsubstituted LiCoO$_2$ , as determined from cycling studies up to 25 cycles, makes it more suitable than the substituted ones for long cycle-life cells with low capacity fade.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fine powders of zirconia were prepared by employing combustion method with varying fuel to precursor molar ratios. The zirconia powders contained more amount of monoclinic phase as the fuel content was increased. This aspect was studied using XRD, IR and UV-vis diffuse reflectance techniques. The surface acidbase properties of these samples were also investigated by indicator titration method. The catalytic activity was probed with transfer hydrogenation reaction in liquid phase. It was found that combustion synthesized zirconia did not provide required active sites for transfer hydrogenation reactions in liquid phase unlike hydrous zirconia.</p>

					<p>The hydroxides of Mg, Ni, Cu and Zn transform into layered double hydroxide (LDH)-like phases on ageing in solutions of Al or Cr salts.

					<p>The dielectric properties of nanophase Ag$_2$HgI$_4$ and Ag$_2$HgI$_4$–Al$_2$O$_3$  nanocomposites at different frequencies have been studied over a temperature range covering the stability range of $\beta$ phase of Ag$_2$HgI$_4$  and beyond the $\beta$ to $\alpha$ phase transition temperature. $\varepsilon'$, tan $\delta$ and $\sigma_{a.c.}$ of nanophase Ag$_2$HgI$_4$ and Ag$_2$HgI$_4$–Al$_2$O$_3$ nanocomposites were found to be larger than the reported values for polycrystalline pellets of Ag$_2$HgI$_4$ . The dielectric properties of the nanocomposites were found to be a function of the wt.&#37; of nano alumina. The observed changes are attributed to the grain boundary properties of nanophase materials and to the microsize space charge effects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies of Se$_{85}$Te$_{15–x}$Pb$_x$  ($x$ = 4, 6, 8 and 10) glasses have been reported and discussed in this paper. The results have been analyzed on the basis of structural relaxation equation, Matusita’s equation and modified Kissinger’s equation. The activation energies of structural relaxation lie in between 226 and 593 kJ/mol. The crystallization growth is found to be onedimensional for all compositions. The activation energies of crystallization are found to be 100–136 kJ/mol by Matusita’s equation while 102–139 kJ/mol by modified Kissinger’s equation. The Hruby number (indicator of ease of glass forming and higher stability) is the highest for Se$_{85}$Te$_9$Pb$_6$  glass while S factor (indicator of resistance to devitrification) is highest for Se$_{85}$Te$_7$Pb$_8$  glass at all heating rates in our experiment. Further the highest resistance to devitrification has the highest value of structural activation energy and the activation energy of crystallization is maximum for the most stable glass by both Matusita’s equation and the modified Kissinger’s equation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis of machinable quality magnesium aluminium silicate (MgO–Al$_2$O$_3$–SiO$_2$) for fabrication of insulators/spacers usable in high voltage applications under high vacuum conditions has been carried out following two different routes i.e.</p>
					<ol type="lower-roman">
						<li>sintering route, and</li>
						<li>glass route.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>A three-stage heating schedule involving calcination, nucleation and crystallization, has been evolved for the preparation of magnesium aluminium silicate (MAS) glass ceramic with MgF$_2$  as a nucleating agent. The effect of sintering temperature on the density of compacted material was studied. Microstructure and machinability of samples obtained from both routes were investigated. They were also characterized for microhardness. Initial studies on material obtained by glass route reveal that these samples are superior to those obtained from sintered route in respect of their high voltage breakdown strength and outgassing behaviour. Outgassing rate of 10$^{–9}$ Torr l⋅s$^{–1}$ cm$^{–2}$  and breakdown strength of 160 kV/cm were obtained. Different types of spacers, lugs, nuts and bolts have been prepared by direct machining of the indigenously developed glass ceramic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A hydrogen-storage alloy of the composition Zr$_{0\cdot5}$Ti$_{0\cdot5}$V$_{0\cdot6}$Cr$_{0\cdot2}$Ni$_{1\cdot2}$ has been investigated for corrosion resistance and hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) in KOH electrolyte of varying concentrations. Activation of the electrode by absorption of hydrogen takes place after prolonged cathodic polarization in the potential range of HER. Prior to activation, the open-circuit potential is about – 0$\cdot$4 V vs Hg/HgO, OH$^–$ , at which the alloy electrode tends to undergo corrosion with oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) as the conjugate reaction. The corrosion–current density measured from Tafel polarization of ORR is found to be independent of KOH concentration and has an average value of about 30 $\mu$A cm$^{–2}$ . Subsequent to activation, the open circuit potential of the electrode is shifted to about – 0$\cdot$93 V vs Hg/HgO, OH$^–$ , which is equal to the reversible potential of HER. The exchange current density values measured from Tafel polarization of HER are marginally higher in relation to the values obtained before the electrode is activated. Alternating-current impedance spectra in the Nyquist form contain two overlapped semicircles. The high-frequency semicircle is attributed to the electrode geometry, while the low-frequency semicircle is due to the charge-transfer reaction and double–layer capacitance. The impedance data are analyzed by a non-linear least square curve fitting technique and impedance parameters are evaluated. </p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The corrosion behaviour of two carbon-alloyed intermetallics of composition Fe–28$\cdot$1Al–2$\cdot$1C and Fe–27$\cdot$5Al–3$\cdot$7C has been studied and compared with that of binary intermetallics. Potentiodynamic polarization studies indicated that the intermetallics exhibited active–passive behaviour in an acidic solution of pH = 1, whereas they exhibited stable passivity in a buffer solution of pH 8$\cdot$4. Corrosion rates were also obtained by immersion testing. The variation of corrosion rate as a function of time was similar for both the intermetallics. The variation in corrosion rate as a function of time has been explained based on the observed potentiodynamic polarization behaviour. Scanning electron microscopy of corroded surfaces indicated that the carbon-alloyed intermetallics were susceptible to galvanic corrosion, due to the presence of carbides.</p>

				<title>A model for two-step ageing</title>
				<feature>Steels and Alloys</feature>
				<page>0405-0411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In commercial practice, two-step ageing is commonly used in Al–Zn–Mg alloys to produce a fine dispersion of $\eta′$ precipitates to accentuate the mechanical properties and resistance to stress corrosion cracking. While this is true in Al–Zn–Mg alloys, two-step ageing leads to inferior properties in Al–Mg–Si alloys. This controversial behaviour in different alloys can be explained by Pashley’s Kinetic model. Pashley’s model addresses the stability of clusters after two-step ageing. In the development of the model, the surface energy term between cluster and matrix is taken into account while the coherency strains between the cluster and matrix are not considered. In the present work, a model is developed which takes into account the coherency strains between cluster and matrix and defines a new stability criterion, inclusive of strain energy term. Experiments were done on AA 7010 aluminium alloy by carrying out a two-step ageing treatment and the results fit the new stability criterion. Thus it is found that the new model for two-step ageing is verified in the case of Al–Zn–Mg alloy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An appreciable electric current is observed in a system consisting of a polyvinyl formal (PVF) film in a sandwich configuration, in the temperature range 30–110$^\circ $C. The maximum value of the current during first heating is found to be of the order of 10$^{–10}$ A and its thermograms exhibit one transition (i.e. current peak) at around 60$^\circ $C. The position of the current peak in thermal spectrum shifts with the heating rate. A temperature dependence of the open circuit voltage is also observed. The activation energy of the process responsible for the current is determined. The magnitude of the current is more in the case of dissimilar electrode systems. It is proposed that the electric current arising from unpolarized metal–polymer–metal system is a water activated phenomenon, which is influenced by the transitional changes of the polymer.</p>

PDMS and GY250 were thoroughly mixed at 30$^\circ $C to get the prepolymer. Stoichiometric amounts of PDMS–epoxy prepolymer, $g$-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, aliphatic amine curing agent (HY951), and dibutyltindilaurate catalyst, were thoroughly mixed and cast in a mould after evacuating the entrapped air. The cured material was then taken out and post cured at 70$^\circ $C for 10 h. IPN was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, DSC, TGA and viscosity measurements. Incorporation of PDMS in the epoxy matrix increased the viscosity and lowered the exotherm and pot-life. PDMS in IPN increased $T_g$ , heat-distortion temperature and reduced the percentage weight loss with increase in temperature. Incorporation of PDMS drastically reduced the tensile and flexural strengths and hardness. By reducing the tensile and flexural modulus, the siloxane moiety effectively reduced the internal stress of IPN thereby improving its impact strength and percentage elongation. PDMS increased the electric potential gradient of IPN to withstand without breakdown. An increase in the tracking index and arc resistance of IPN were observed, because of the presence of Si–O–Si, which minimized the possibility of forming carbonized path. Volume and surface resistivities of IPN also increased with the incorporation of PDMS. The siliconized epoxy IPN, with better impact and thermal resistance, may be used in automobile and aerospace applications to withstand high temperature, and mechanical stress. The PDMS–epoxy IPN may be used for encapsulation, high temperature and high voltage application due to their low shrinkage and lesser internal stress. With the improved electrical characteristics, IPN may be used for high performance electrical insulation, insulator housings, and encapsulation to withstand high voltage, moisture, oxidation, chemical attack, biological attack, outdoor weathering, contamination, electrical, mechanical and thermal stress.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The system SrBi$_4$Ti$_{4–3x}$Fe$_{4x}$O$_{15}$ belonging to bismuth layer structured ferroelectric (BLSF) materials with $x$ = 0, 0$\cdot$1 and 0$\cdot$2 has been prepared through solid-state double sintering method. Increase of iron content in SrBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ resulted in densification of the samples. The normal puckering observed in the sample has been found to decrease and the lattice distortion increased. Dielectric measurements indicate the ferroelectric transition temperature of the samples to be 530$^\circ $C, 560$^\circ $C and 606$^\circ $C. The increase of transition temperature with increasing iron content is correlated with lattice distortion. Conductivity measurements show two slopes and the activation energies have been found to increase with the iron content. Impedance spectroscopy measurements confirm insulating behaviour at lower temperatures. With increase in temperature the samples become conducting and show relaxational effects. The Cole–Cole plots at higher temperatures are found to be semicircles. The relaxation times decrease with the increase of iron content.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal conductivity of a set of (Bi$_{0\cdot8}$Pb$_{0\cdot2–y}$V$_y$)$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$(0 = $y \leq$0$\cdot$05) pellets in the temperature range between 10 and 150 K is reported. Vanadium substitution influences strongly the magnitude of thermal conductivity ($\lambda$) over the entire temperature range. But the nature of $\lambda(T)$ dependence remains similar to that generally observed for HTSCs. The electronic contribution to the total $\lambda$ in the normal state is estimated to be $\sim$ 25%. We have attempted to examine our data, assuming the role of both electrons and phonons in the origin of the $\lambda(T)$ behaviour below $T_c$ . Observed temperature variation of $\lambda(T)$ for the present set of samples could be explained very well assuming this electron + approach. Some of the microscopic quantities estimated from the best-fit parameters give reasonable values.</p>

					<p>Efficient preparation of stable dispersions of platinum nanoparticles from platinous chloride (K$_2$PtCl$_4$) was achieved by simultaneous addition of capping polymer material. The size of platinum nanoparticles was controlled by changing the ratio of concentration of capping polymer material to the concentration of platinum cation used. The morphology of colloidal particles were studied by means of UV-visible spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Particle size increased with low reagent concentration. The change in absorption spectra with the particle size was observed, i.e. blue shift attributed to decrease in particle size.</p>

					<p>The influence of temperature on current–voltage ($I–V$) characteristics of Au/$n$-GaAs Schottky diode formed on $n$-GaAs epitaxial layer grown by metal organic chemical vapour deposition technique has been investigated. The dopant concentration in the epitaxial layer is 1 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{−3}$ . The change in various parameters of the diode like Schottky barrier height (SBH), ideality factor and reverse breakdown voltage as a function of temperature in the range 80−300 K is presented. The variation of apparent Schottky barrier height and ideality factor with temperature has been explained considering lateral inhomogeneities in the Schottky barrier height in nanometer scale lengths at the metal–semiconductor interface.</p>

				<title>Investigations on Tl-2223 thin films fabricated through ultrasonic spray pyrolysis under oxygen deficient conditions</title>
				<feature>Superconductors</feature>
				<page>0475-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we have shown that polycrystalline films corresponding to Tl-2223 phase can be grown by employing high thalliation temperatures and short thalliation times. Ultrasonically deposited precursor films corresponding to Ba$_2$Ca$_{2\cdot2}$Cu$_{3\cdot3}$O$_x$(Ag$_y$) have been thalliated under high vacuum ($\sim$ 10$^{–5}$ torr) at 890$^\circ $C to obtain single phase Tl-2223 films. An off-stoichiometric and unreacted pellet of composition Tl$_{2\cdot05}$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_z$  has been used as source of Tl. We have shown that oxygen ambient is not necessary for the growth of Tl-2223 phase. The as-thalliated films have $T_c$’s in the range 123 K $\pm$ 0$\cdot$70 K. The $T_c$  has been found to be independent of the addition of AgNO$_3$  to the precursor. The zero field transport $J_c$  has been observed to be $\gt$ 1$\cdot$2 $\times$ 10$^5$  A/cm$^2$  at 77 K. Near $T_c$ (110 K–122 K), $J_c$  has been observed to follow the power law $J_c \propto$ (1 – $T/T_c)^p , p \approx$ 2. A power law with $p \approx$ 1$\cdot$4 has been observed for the temperature range 70 K–110 K. An optimum doping of Ag has been observed to induce about 25% increase in $J_c$  and it also leads to uniform and enlarged grain growth. The surface morphology of Ag free samples contains plate like grains having arbitrary shapes. In contrast to this 0$\cdot$35 Ag doped sample exhibits nearly rectangular plate like grains.</p>

					<p>Ba$_{1\cdot5–x}$Sr$_x$Zr$_4$P$_5$SiO$_{24}$ compounds with $x$ = 0, 0$\cdot$25, 0$\cdot$5, 0$\cdot$75, 1$\cdot$0, 1$\cdot$25 and 1$\cdot$5, belonging to the low thermal expansion NZP family were synthesized by the solid state reaction method. The XRD pattern could be completely indexed with respect to R$\bar{3}$ space group indicating the ordering of vacancy at the divalent cation octahedral sites. The microstructure and bulk thermal expansion coefficient from room temperature to 800$^\circ $C of the sintered samples have been studied. All the samples show very low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), with $x = 0$ samples showing negative expansion. A small substitution of strontium in the pure barium compound changes the sign of CTE. Similarly, $x$ = 1$\cdot$5 sample (pure strontium) shows a positive CTE and a small substitution of barium changes its sign. $X$ = 1$\cdot$0 and 1$\cdot$25 samples have almost constant CTE over the entire temperature range. The low thermal expansion of these samples can be attributed to the ordering of the ions in the crystal structure of these materials.</p>

				<title>Influence of strontium on the cubic to ordered hexagonal phase transformation in barium magnesium niobate</title>
				<feature>Phase Transitions</feature>
				<page>0495-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oxides of the type Ba$_{3–x}$Sr$_x$MgNb$_2$O$_9$  were synthesized by the solid state route. The $x$ = 0 composition (Ba$_3$MgNb$_2$O$_9$) was found to crystallize in a disordered (cubic) perovskite structure when sintered at 1000C. For higher Sr doping ($x \geq$ 0$\cdot$5), there was clearly the presence of an ordered hexagonal phase indicated by the growth of superstructure reflections in the powder X-ray diffraction patterns. In all the compositions there was the presence of a minor amount of Ba$_{5–x}$Sr$_x$Nb$_4$O$_{15}$ phase which increased with Sr substitution up to $x$ = 1 and then it remained nearly constant at about 5%. Samples sintered at 1300C showed the hexagonally ordered phase for the entire range of composition (0$\leq x \leq$3). The degree of ordering being considerably greater than in the 1000C heated samples as evidenced by several superstructure reflections.</p>

				<title>Oxynitride glasses$—$An overview</title>
				<feature>Glasses</feature>
				<page>0499-0507</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The theory and practice of oxynitride glass synthesis and property evaluation came into effect since late 70’s. Its importance lies in the fact of its formation at the grain-boundary of synthesized silicon–nitride ceramics with additives. Earlier, heating an oxide glass with NH$_3$  and/or N$_2$  was the route to obtain oxynitride glass. Later on greater amount of nitrogen retention was made possible using AlN or Si$_3$N$_4$ as batch material. Silicate, borate and phosphate systems were studied in isolation or in conjugation. Melting temperature of such glasses varied from 1500–1800$^\circ $C. Different technological developments regarding furnace atmosphere, temperature, compositions etc have been discussed towards a successful synthesis with a thermodynamic approach. Nitrogen content in glass as high as 36$\cdot$8 eq% has been reported by the application of an overpressure of 30 atm N$_2$. Different physical and chemical properties have been discussed in relation to nitrogen content in glass. Structural aspects have been considered with respect to XPS and IR spectroscopic studies. Finally some points have been highlighted towards some potential applications. </p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The preparation of (40 – $x$)Li$_2$O–$x$LiF–60Bi$_2$O$_3$  glassy system and spectroscopic and transport studies of this system are reported. IR results show that this glass consists of [BiO$_3$] units and indicate formation of Bi–F bonds with the addition of LiF. From the ESR spectra of Cu$^{2+}$ ion, the effective $g$ values are found to vary slightly with increasing concentration of fluorine ion. The optical absorption peak corresponding to Cu$^{2+}$ increased linearly with increasing concentration of LiF between 620 nm and 728 nm except at 2$\cdot$5 mole% of LiF where its value is 729 nm. This peculiar behaviour is attributed to the varying structural coordination of fluorine as the concentration of lithium fluoride is increased. The ionic conductivity measurements indicate that the conduction is due to adiabatic hopping of polarons and the activation energies are found to be temperature and concentration dependent.</p>

				<page>0515-0520</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Immobilization and solidification of hazardous cations like Cs$^{137}$ and Sr$^{90}$ are required while handling the radioactive waste of nuclear power plants. Efforts are on to find a fail proof method of safe disposal of nuclear wastes. In this context, various materials like borosilicate glass, zeolites, cements and synthetic rocks have been tried by several workers. This communication deals with the synthesis, characterization, cesium uptake capacity and leaching behaviour of synthetic alumina-substituted calcium silicate hydroxy hydrate, which are close to that obtained for the natural mineral, 11 Å tobermorite. The synthetic mineral show cation selectivity for Cs${}^+$  in presence of 500–1000 times concentrated solutions of Na$^+$ , K$^+$ , Mg$^{2+}$, Ca$^{2+}$ , Ba$^{2+}$ and Sr$^{2+}$. Although the ordinary portland cement (OPC) which is often used in waste management operations alone holds negligible amounts of Cs$^+$  and Sr$^{2+}$, the addition of alumina-substituted tobermorite to OPC enhances the retention power of cement matrix by drastically lowering the leach rate of cations.</p>

				<title>Resistance to freezing and thawing of mortar specimens made from sulphoaluminate–belite cement</title>
				<feature>Cements</feature>
				<page>0521-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Resistance to freezing and thawing of mortar specimens made from sulphoaluminate–belite cement (M–SAB) is compared with that of mortars made from portland cement (M–PC). The results suggest that larger median radius of the pores and total porosity of M–SAB compared to those of M–PC are primarily caused by the rapid setting of the SAB cement. The ‘coarsening’ of pore structure of mortar specimens under action of freezing and thawing is proved by the increase in the macropores portion, median pore radius, and total porosity values. This process is more intense in M–SAB. The effect of the frost attack is confirmed by lower compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity on the one hand and higher absorption capacity, expansion, and crack propagation of M–SAB compared with those of M–PC on the other hand. Besides the decreased frost resistance of M–SAB as compared with that of M–PC, unsatisfactory passivation of steel in M–SAB was found. The reason of this fact is the pH value decrease to less than 11$\cdot$5 of the M–SAB extract.</p>

				<title>Effect of doping on TSD relaxation in cellulose acetate films</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0529-0532</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) studies have been performed on solution grown cellulose acetate films doped with different concentrations of acrylic acid (AA) prepared at the poling temperatures (40–75$^\circ $C) with poling fields (10–50 kV/cm). The TSDC spectra of pure and AA doped CA films reveal two relaxation peaks at 80$^\circ $C and 180 $\pm$ 2$^\circ $C, having activation energies centred around 0$\cdot$25 and 0$\cdot$55 eV. The phenomena of the existence of these current maxima have been analyzed and discussed in terms of the molecular motion of the polar side groups and release of the remaining part of the frozen dipoles by their cooperative motion with adjoining segments of the main polymer chain. The peak currents, released charge and activation energies associated with the peaks are affected by AA doping. The effect of doping with acrylic acid on the discharge current indicates the formation of molecular aggregates.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Irradiation effects of 50 MeV ${}^7$Li$^{+3}$ ion beam induced in bulk PVDF polymer have been studied with respect to their optical, chemical, structural and electrical behaviour by using UV-visible, FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD technique and electrical frequency response using LCR bridge. The ion fluences ranging from 1$\cdot$27 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ to 2$\cdot$15 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ ions cm$^{–2}$ have been used to study dose effects of irradiation in PVDF. The recorded UV-visible spectra clearly shows five characteristic peaks at 315, 325, 360, 425 and 600 nm. Due to irradiation, the optical absorption initially decreases but then increases with higher fluences. In the FT-IR spectra, no appreciable change has been observed after irradiation, indicating that this polymer is chemically stable. There is exponential increase in admittance with log of frequency but the effect of irradiation is not quite appreciable. The value of tan $d$ and relaxation frequency are changed appreciably due to irradiation. The diffraction pattern of PVDF indicates that this polymer is in semi-crystalline form; a decrease in the crystallinity and crystallite size has been observed due to irradiation.</p>

					<p>The method for the measurement of the pure mechanical wear loss for 321 stainless steel, 1045 steel and pure iron in the study of the synergy between corrosion and wear was studied. The methods studied included the measurement in distilled water, by cathodic protection and by adding inhibitor KI, and all were compared with the wear loss in air. The experiment showed that the pure mechanical wear losses and friction coefficients obtained by the three methods were close to each other and can be used to calculate the various wear components in the study of the interaction of corrosion and wear, but the measurements in distilled water for pure iron and 1045 steel are not recommended due to their corrosion.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The current status of experimental as well as theoretical advances in the understanding of kinetics of structural phase transitions is reviewed. A brief outline of the classification of phase transitions and classical ideas in the theory of kinetics of phase change is presented first. High pressure experimental techniques developed for studying the kinetics of structural transitions are reviewed and the salient features of each technique is brought out. The experimental technique using the diamond anvil cell (DAC) and image processing gets special mention as it promises to impart a new direction to this field. The usefulness of kinetic parameters in understanding the mechanism of a phase transition is examined. Typical examples from the literature are provided to give a flavour for these kind of studies. In conclusion, several open questions are raised which could pave way for future work in this area.</p>

				<title>On the origin of recrystallization textures</title>
				<feature>Review---Phase Transitions</feature>
				<page>0023-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The development of recrystallization textures has been debated for the past 50 years. Essentially the rival theories of evolution of recrystallization textures i.e. oriented nucleation (ON) and oriented growth (OG) has been under dispute. In the ON model, it has been argued that a higher frequency of the special orientation (grains) than random occur, thus accounting for the texture. In the OG model, it has been argued that the specially oriented grains have a high mobility boundary and thus can migrate faster and grow to a larger size as compared to random orientations thus contributing to the final recrystallization texture.</p>
					<p>In FCC metals and alloys like aluminium, cube orientation [(001) $\langle$100$\rangle$] is the recrystallization texture component. In the classic OG model, cube orientation is supposed to be misoriented from $S$-orientation [(123) $\langle$63$\bar{4}\rangle$] which is a deformation texture component by a 40$^\circ $ about $\langle$111$\rangle$ relationship which is supposed to be a high mobility boundary leading to faster growth of cube grains. Stereographic calculations and analytical calculations are presented in this paper to the effect that the $S$-orientation (123) $\langle$63$\bar{4}\rangle$ is not misoriented from cube (100) $\langle$001$\rangle$ by 40$^\circ $ (111) whereas another deformation texture component (123) $\langle$41$\bar{2}\rangle$ which is termed the $R$-component is misoriented from cube component by 40$^\circ \ \langle$111$\rangle$ . $R$-component is also seen in deformation textures of aluminium and hence the classic OG model remains valid with respect to the $R$-component.</p>

				<title>Effect of high-energy heavy ion irradiation on the crystallization kinetics of Co-based metallic glasses</title>
				<feature>Review---Phase Transitions</feature>
				<page>0027-0033</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) is employed to study the crystallization kinetics of irradiated (at three different fluences with high-energy heavy ion; Ni$^{11+}$ of 150 MeV) specimens of two Co-based metallic glasses. It is found that the crystallization process in both the glasses is completed in two phases. The DSC data have been analysed in terms of kinetic parameters viz. activation energy ($E_c$), Avrami exponent ($n$), dimensionality of growth ($m$), using two different theoretical models. The results obtained have been compared with that of virgin samples. The lower activation energy in case of second crystallization occurring at higher temperature indicates the easier nucleation of second phase. The abnormally high value of Avrami exponent in Co–Ni glass indicates very high nucleation rate during first crystallization.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Highly oriented thin films of Fe$_3$O$_4$ were deposited on (100) LaAlO$_3$ substrates by pulsed laser ablation. The structural quality of the films was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The films showed a Verwey transition near 120 K. The films were subjected to 80 keV Ar$^+$ implantation at different ion doses up to a maximum of $6 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$. Ion beam induced modifications in the films were investigated using XRD and resistance vs temperature measurements. Implantation decreases the change in resistance at 120 K and this effect saturates beyond $3 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$. The Verwey transition temperature, $T_V$, shifts towards lower temperatures with increase in ion dose.</p>

These decompose (autocatalytically) in an ordinary atmosphere to mainly $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, while the unhydrazinated iron(II) carboxylates in air yield $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, but the controlled atmosphere of moisture requires for the oxalates to stabilize the metastable $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. The hydrazine released during heating reacts with atmospheric oxygen liberating enormous energy, $$N_2H_4 + O_2 \rightarrow N_2 + H_2O;\Delta H_2O = – 621 kJ/mol,$$ which enables to oxidatively decompose the dehydrazinated complex to $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. The reaction products N$_2$ + H$_2$O provide the necessary atmosphere of moisture needed for the stabilization of the metastable oxide.</p>

					<p>A new compound, CaMg$_2$Fe$_{16}$O$_{27}$, is synthesized for the first time, in polycrystalline form, using stoichiometric mixture of oxides with standard ceramic technique and characterized by X-ray diffraction. It is found to have a hexagonal W-type structure with lattice parameters $a$ = 5$\cdot$850 Å and $c$ = 33$\cdot$156 Å. Electrical studies show that the compound is a semiconductor with energy of activation, $\Delta E$ = 0$\cdot$56 eV. Electrical conductivity results show a transition in the conductivity vs temperature plot near the Curie temperature. The activation energy value obtained for the paramagnetic phase is found to be higher than that of the ferrimagnetic phase. The molar magnetic susceptibility was measured in the temperature range 300–850 K and the results show that the compound is ferrimagnetic at room temperature. The compound also shows hysteresis at 300 K. Paramagnetic nature of the sample above Curie temperature is also studied. The Curie molar constant $C_M$ calculated from the plot of 1/$\chi_M$ vs $T(K)$ is found to be nearly in agreement with the expected value.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Spinel lithium manganese oxide, LiMn$_2$O$_4$, is beset with problems of capacity fade upon repeated cycling. The loss in capacity upon cycling is attributable to Jahn–Teller distortion and manganese dissolution in the electrolyte in the charged state. One way to circumvent this capacity fade is to introduce other $3d$ transition metal ions in the LiMn$_2$O$_4$ lattice. In this paper, we report on the effect of partial substitution of manganese in the LiMn$_2$O$_4$ phase with copper (II) and chromium (III) ions. It has been shown that the higher octahedral stabilization energy of trivalent chromium imparts greater structural stability to chromium-doped LiMn$_2$O$_4$ spinels. Both copper and chromium reduce the capacity of the spinel in the 4 V region. In terms of its good reversible capacity and ability to sustain cycling with minimal capacity fade, LiCr$_{0\cdot1}$Mn$_{1\cdot9}$O$_4$  may be considered as a potential cathode material for lithium rechargeable cells.</p>

				<title>pH controlled dispersion and slip casting of Si$_3$N$_4$ in aqueous media</title>
				<feature>Advanced Ceramics</feature>
				<page>0057-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dispersion characteristics of commercial Si$_3$N$_4$  powder in aqueous media (deionized water) was studied as a function of pH in the range 2–11. The slip was characterized for its dispersion quality by various experimental techniques like particle size analysis, sedimentation phenomena, viscosity and flow behaviour and zeta potential analysis. The optimum dispersion was found to be in the pH region 9–11 wherein the slurry displayed minimum sedimentation height, minimum viscosity, near Newtonian flow behaviour and maximum zeta potential. The slip is highly agglomerated in the pH range 2–8 as manifested by higher sedimentation height, higher viscosity, lower zeta potential and thixotropic non-Newtonian flow behaviour. The 72 wt% (44 vol.%) Si$_3$N$_4$ slips made at pH = 10 resulted in green bodies having 53–59% of theoretical density after casting into plaster molds.</p>

				<title>Impact fatigue behaviour of carbon fibre-reinforced vinylester resin composites</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0079-0086</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two types of unidirectional carbon fibre, one of high strength (DHMS) and another of medium strength (VLMS) reinforced vinylester resin composites have been examined for their impact fatigue behaviour over 10$^4$ impact cycles for the first time. The study was conducted using a pendulum type repeated impact apparatus specially designed and constructed for the purpose. A well-defined impact fatigue behaviour (S–N type curve) curve has been demonstrated. It showed a plateau region of 10–10$^2$  cycles immediately below the single cycle impact strength, followed by progressive endurance with decreasing impact loads, culminating in an endurance limit at about 71% and 85% of the single impact strength for DHMS-48 and VLMS-48, respectively. Analysis of the fractured surfaces revealed primary debonding, fibre breakage and pull-out at the tensile zone of the samples and a shear mode of fracture with breakage of fibre bundles at the compressive zone of the samples. The occurrence of a few major macrocracks in the matrix with fibre breakage at the high load–low endurance region and development of multiple microcracks in the matrix, coalescing and fibre breakage at the low-load–high endurance region have been inferred to explain the fatigue behaviour of the composites examined.</p>

				<title>Effects of moisture on the mechanical properties of glass fibre reinforced vinylester resin composites</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0087-0094</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glass fibre reinforced vinylester resin composites incorporating varying amounts of fibres (63$\cdot$5, 55$\cdot$75, 48$\cdot$48, 38$\cdot$63 and 27$\cdot$48 wt%) were characterized for their mechanical properties both as prepared and after treatment with boiling water for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h. Weights of the samples were found to increase to a saturation at about 8 h with boiling water treatment.</p>
					<p>In keeping with the composite principle, the mechanical properties improved with fibre loading. However, the properties were relatively inferior when treated with boiling water for longer hours attributing to ingress of moisture by capillary action through the interface between the fibre and the resin matrix. Considering the rates of moisture absorption and correlating with the mechanical properties, it was observed that the deteriorating effects were predominant up to 4 h treatment with boiling water. Estimation of defect concentrations for 63$\cdot$5 wt% of nascent fibre reinforced composites as well as those composites treated with boiling water for 24 h were 56$\cdot$93% and 64$\cdot$16% respectively. Similarly, 27$\cdot$48 wt% nascent fibre reinforced composites and those composites with boiling water treatment showed the estimation of defect concentrations of 39$\cdot$94% and 50$\cdot$55% respectively. SEM study of the fractured surfaces showed heavy fibre pull-out in the tensile zone whilst shear fracture of the fibre bundles was predominant at the compressive zone of the samples tested for flexural strength properties.</p>

				<title>Some numerical approaches of creep, thermal shock, damage and delayed failure of ceramics and refractories</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Numerical simulation is now very often used to predict the behaviour of components in service conditions. This paper is interested in specific approaches concerning ceramic materials and refractories. Creep can be satisfactorily described by a kinematic hardening, and exhibits different creep rates in tension and compression. Concerning the thermal shock of materials, the numerical approach depends whether or not the material is able to develop a sprayed out damage, leading to micro- or macro-cracking. Finally, delayed failure at high temperature can be considered as a consequence of creep, but the random aspect of failure seriously complicates the numerical models. The lack of experimental data presently limits the calibration and the validation of the numerical models.</p>

				<title>Effect of zirconia addition on the fatigue behaviour of fine grained alumina</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0101-0104</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fatigue behaviour of fine grained Al$_2$O$_3$ and ZrO$_2$ toughened Al$_2$O$_3$ (ZTA) compositions with 15 vol% ZrO$_2$ (3 mol% Y$_2$O$_3$  stabilized: 3Y-TZP) have been investigated by using three different techniques. Primarily 4-point bending load was employed to generate tension–tension fatigue data under both static and cyclic conditions. The results clearly showed that the materials were susceptible to both the static and cyclic fatigue and the time to failure under cyclic loading was considerably shorter than the equivalent static loads. The repeated indentations at the same spot with varying loads showed a typical fatigue behaviour. In addition, both the materials were subjected to the repeated impact cycles at varying subcritical loads simulating impact fatigue. In all the cases typical fatigue curves were obtained having a progressive endurance at subcritical loads having an endurance limit. The fatigue behaviour of Al$_2$O$_3$  was much improved by the addition of 15 vol% 3Y-TZP, having micro-plasticity contributing towards the cyclic fatigue phenomena of these materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Repeated indentation fatigue (RIF) experiments conducted on the same spot of different structural ceramics viz. a hot pressed silicon nitride (HPSN), sintered alumina of two different grain sizes viz. 1 $\mu$m and 25 $\mu$m, and a sintered silicon carbide (SSiC) are reported. The RIF experiments were conducted using a Vicker’s microhardness tester at various loads in the range 1–20 N. Subsequently, the gradual evolution of the damage was characterized using an optical microscope in conjunction with the image analysing technique. The materials were classified in the order of the decreasing resistance against repeated indentation fatigue at the highest applied load of 20 N. It was further shown that there was a strong influence of grain size on the development of resistance against repeated indentation fatigue on the same spot. Finally, the poor performance of the sintered silicon carbide was found out to be linked to its previous thermal history.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An $in\ situ$ technique for the assessment of fracture resistance employing double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens was developed in the present study. The side-grooved DCB specimens were loaded with pure bending moments in a specially designed and fabricated test fixture which went inside the specimen chamber of a scanning electron microscope. The study as conducted on a 8 mol% fully stabilized cubic phase yttria (Y$_2$O$_3$) stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic. The powder processed sheets were sintered at 1600$^\circ $C for 2 h in a zirconia tube furnace. The mode I applied energy release rate, $G_I$ was determined for both pure YSZ and treated YSZ. Two sets of experiments were conducted for the complete characterization of the ceramics. Three fracture toughness values were determined for the pure and treated ceramics, viz.</p>

						<li>at the arrest of a subcritical crack, $G_{ia}$ and</li>
						<li>at the onset of the fast fracture, $G_{if}$.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Two analyses of the experimental data were carried out, viz. method of extrapolation and statistical analysis. In case of the pure YSZ, a transgranular mode of the stable crack growth was identified to be predominant. The porous coating treatment appeared to have positive effects as the crack initiation resistance increased due to electrode layers. The stable crack growth behaviours of the ceramics were investigated by monitoring the crack growth velocity as a function of applied $G$ values. The results obtained were of direct significance in designing and fabrication of SOFC stacks.</p>

				<title>Fracture toughness and reliability in high-temperature structural ceramics and composites: Prospects and challenges for the 21st Century</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0117-0120</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The importance of high fracture toughness and reliability in Si$_3$N$_4$, and SiC-based structural ceramics and ceramic matrix composites is reviewed. The potential of these ceramics and ceramic matrix composites for high temperature applications in defence and aerospace applications such as gas turbine engines, radomes, and other energy conversion hardware have been well recognized. Numerous investigations were pursued to improve fracture toughness and reliability by incorporating various reinforcements such as particulate-, whisker-, and continuous fibre into Si$_3$N$_4$ and SiC matrices. All toughening mechanisms, e.g. crack deflection, crack branching, crack bridging, etc essentially redistribute stresses at the crack tip and increase the energy needed to propagate a crack through the composite material, thereby resulting in improved fracture toughness and reliability. Because of flaw insensitivity, continuous fibre reinforced ceramic composite (CFCC) was found to have the highest potential for higher operating temperature and longer service conditions. However, the ceramic fibres should display sufficient high temperature strength and creep resistance at service temperatures above 1000$^\circ $C. The greatest challenge to date is the development of high quality ceramic fibres with associate coatings able to maintain their high strength in oxidizing environment at high temperature. In the area of processing, critical issues are preparation of optimum matrix precursors, precursor infiltration into fibre array, and matrix densification at a temperature, where grain crystallization and fibre degradation do not occur. A broad scope of effort is required for improved processing and properties with a better understanding of all candidate composite systems.</p>

				<title>Mechanical characteristics of microwave sintered silicon carbide</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0121-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present work deals with the sintering of SiC with a low melting additive by microwave technique. The mechanical characteristics of the products were compared with that of conventionally sintered products. The failure stress of the microwave sintered products, in biaxial flexure, was superior to that of the products made by conventional sintering route in ambient condition. In firing of products by conventionally sintered process, SiC grain gets oxidized producing SiO$_2$ ($\sim$ 32 wt%) and deteriorates the quality of the product substantially. Partially sintered silicon carbide by such a method is a useful material for a varieties of applications ranging from kiln furniture to membrane material.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The mechanical characterization of microwave sintered zinc oxide disks is reported. The microwave sintering was done with a specially designed applicator placed in a domestic microwave oven operating at a frequency of 2$\cdot$45 GHz to a maximum power output of 800 Watt. These samples with a wide variation of density and hence, of open pore volume percentage, were characterized in terms of its elastic modulus determination by ultrasonic time of flight measurement using a 15 MHz transducer. In addition, the load dependence of the microhardness was examined for the range of loads 0$\cdot$1–20 N. Finally, the fracture toughness data ($K_{IC}$) was obtained using the indentation technique.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Jute fibres were subjected to a 5% alkali (NaOH) solution treatment for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h at 30$^\circ $C. An improvement in the crystallinity in the jute fibres increased its modulus by 12%, 68% and 79% after 4, 6 and 8 h of treatment respectively. The tenacity of the fibres improved by 46% after 6 and 8 h treatment and the % breaking strain was reduced by 23% after 8 h treatment. For the 35% composites with 4 h treated fibres, the flexural strength improved from 199$\cdot$1 MPa to 238$\cdot$9 MPa by 20%, modulus improved from 11$\cdot$89 GPa to 14$\cdot$69 GPa by 23% and laminar shear strength increased from 0$\cdot$238 MPa to 0$\cdot$2834 MPa by 19%. On plotting the different values of slopes obtained from the rates of improvement of the flexural strength and modulus, against the NaOH treatment time, two different failure modes were apparent before and after 4 h of treatment. In the first region between 0 and 4 h, fibre pull out was predominant whereas in the second region between 6 and 8 h, transverse fracture occurred with a minimum fibre pull out. This observation was well supported by the SEM investigations of the fracture surfaces.</p>

				<page>0137-0142</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An impact fatigue study has been made for the first time on 63$\cdot$5% glass fibre reinforced vinylester resin notched composites. The study was conducted in a pendulum type repeated impact apparatus especially designed and fabricated for determining single and repeated impact strengths. A well-defined impact fatigue (S–N) behaviour, having a progressive endurance below the threshold single cycle impact fracture stress with decreasing applied stress has been demonstrated. Fractographic analysis revealed fracture by primary debonding having fibre breakage and pullout at the tensile zone, but a shear fracture of fibre bundles at the compressive zone of the specimen. The residual strength, modulus and toughness showed retention of the properties at high impact stress levels up to 1000 impacts followed by a sharp drop. Cumulative residual stresses with each number of impacts not withstanding the static fatigue failure at long endurances have been ascribed for the composite failures under the repeated impact stresses.</p>

				<page>0143-0149</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present work aims at the first ply failure analysis of laminated composite plates with arbitrarily located multiple delaminations subjected to transverse static load as well as impact. The theoretical formulation is based on a simple multiple delamination model. Conventional first order shear deformation is assumed using eight-noded isoparametric quadratic elements to develop the finite element analysis procedure. Composite plates are assumed to contain both single and multiple delaminations. For the case of impact, Newmark time integration algorithm is employed for solving the time dependent multiple equations of the plate and the impactor. Tsai-Wu failure criterion is used to check for failure of the laminate for both the cases. To investigate the first ply failure, parametric studies are made for different cases by varying the size and number of delaminations as well as the stacking sequences and boundary conditions.</p>

					<p>The biaxial flexural strength, Young’s modulus, Vicker’s microhardness and fracture toughness data for very thin, commercial, soda-lime-silica cover slip glass (diameter, D-18 mm, thickness, T-0 3 mm; T/D $\approx$ 0$\cdot$02) are reported here. The ball on ring biaxial flexure tests were conducted at room temperature as a function of the support ring diameter ($\approx$10–20 mm) and cross head speed (0$\cdot$1–10 mm min$^{–1}$). In addition, the Weibull modulus data were also determined. The Young’s modulus data was measured using a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) from biaxial flexure tests and was checked out to be comparable to the data obtained independently from the ultrasonic time of flight measurement using a 15 MHz transducer. The microhardness data was obtained for the applied load range of 0$\cdot$1–20 N. The fracture toughness ($K_{IC}$) data was obtained by the indentation technique at an applied load of 20 N.</p>

The material was rotated through 0$^\circ $– 90$^\circ $ and at each angle a 20 N load was applied to ascertain the crack path. It was observed that the crack length decreases and the crack deviates from its original path with increasing angle.

				<abstract>
					<p>An X-ray powder profile analysis in vanadium pentoxide powder milled in a high energy vibrational ball-mill for different lengths of time (0–250 h), is presented. The strain and size induced broadening of the Bragg reflection for two different crystallographic directions ([001] and [100]) was determined by Warren–Averbach analysis using a pattern-decomposition method assuming a Pseudo–Voigt function. The deformation process caused a decrease in the crystallite size and a saturation of crystallite size of $\sim$ 10 nm was reached after severe milling. The initial stages of milling indicated a propensity of size-broadening due to fracture of the powder particles caused by repeated ball-to-powder impact whereas with increasing milling time microstrain broadening was predominant. WA analysis indicated significant plastic strain along with spatial confinement of the internal strain fields in the crystallite interfaces. Significant strain anisotropy was noticed in the different crystallographic directions. A near-isotropy in the crystallite size value was noticed for materials milled for 200 h and beyond. The column-length distribution function obtained from the size Fourier coefficients progressively narrowed down with the milling time.</p>

					<p>MoSi$_2$–RBSC composite samples were prepared by infiltration of Si–2 at.% Mo melt into a preform of commercial SiC and petroleum coke powder. The infiltrated sample had a density $\gt$ 92% of the theoretical density (TD) and microstructurally contained SiC, MoSi$_2$, residual Si and unreacted C. The material was tested for indentation fracture toughness at room temperature with a Vicker’s indenter and KIC was found to be 4$\cdot$42 MPa $\surd$m which is around 39% higher than the conventional RBSC material. Enhancement in indentation fracture toughness is explained in terms of bowing of propagating cracks through MoSi$_2$/SiC interface which is under high thermal stress arising from the thermal expansion mismatch between MoSi$_2$ and SiC.</p>

				<title>Stereological characterization of crack path transitions in ceramic matrix composites</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0185-0190</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>All ceramic composites involve a mismatch in physical properties the extent of which differs from one composite to another. Mismatch in thermal expansion ($\Delta \alpha$) and elastic modulus ($\Delta $E) is known to produce stresses that influence the path of a propagating crack. Thus, the relative effect of thermal and elastic mismatch on the crack path is expected to change with change in stress intensity. We propose that the crack path in ceramic composites should undergo a transition with the crack being strongly influenced by the thermal mismatch stresses at low stress intensity and elastic mismatch stresses at high stress intensities. Thus, a material in use under different applications each with its own loading conditions is expected to exhibit different crack propagation tendencies which may be reflected in the $v–K$ characteristics of the composite material. In the present work several model composites with different combinations of thermal and elastic mismatch have been considered. Cracks propagating at different sub-critical stress intensities (velocities) were generated by a novel indentation technique. Each indentation was performed at a constant displacement rate and a peak load. A range of displacement rates were used to produce cracks propagating at different velocities. The indentations were made using a Vickers indentor fitted in a universal mechanical testing machine. The crack paths in composites were quantified by stereological technique and the proposed theory was verified.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mullite–SiC nanocomposites are synthesized by introducing surface modified sol–gel mullite coated SiC particles in the matrix and densification and associated microstructural features of such precursor are reported. Nanosize SiC (average size 180 nm) surface was first provided with a mullite precursor coating which was characterized by the X-ray analysis and TEM. An average coating thickness of 120 nm was obtained on the SiC particles. The green compacts obtained by cold isostatic pressing were sintered in the range 1500–1700$^\circ $C under pressureless sintering in the N$_2$ atmosphere. The percentage of the theoretical sintered density decreases with increase in SiC content. A maximum sintered density of 97% was achieved for mullite–5 vol.% SiC. The fractograph of the sintered composite showed a highly dense, fine grained microstructure with the SiC particles uniformly distributed along the grains as well as at the grain boundaries inside the mullite. The Vicker’s microhardness of mullite–5 vol.% SiC composite was measured as 1320 kg/mm$^2$ under an applied indentation load of 500 $g$. This value gradually decreased with an increase in SiC content.</p>

				<page>0197-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The preliminary experimental studies on the comparative behaviour of the deformation processes involved in the failure of a commercial, 0$\cdot$3 mm thick, 18 mm diameter soda–lime–silica glass disks ($G$) and multilayered glass disk–epoxy (GE) as well as glass disk–epoxy–$E$-glass fabric (GEF) composite structures are reported. The failure tests were conducted in a biaxial flexure at room temperature. The epoxy was a commercial resin and the $E$-glass fabric was also commercially obtained as a two-dimensional weave of $E$-glass fibres to an area density of about 242 g m$^{–2}$. The multilayered structures were developed by alternate placement of the glass and reinforcing layers by a hand lay-up technique followed by lamination at an appropriate temperature and pressure. Depending on the number of layers the volume fraction of reinforcement could be varied from about 0$\cdot$20 for the GE system to about 0$\cdot$50 for the GEF system. It was observed that the specific failure load (load per unit thickness) was enhanced from a value of about 60 N/mm obtained for the glass to a maximum value of about 100 N/mm for the GE composites and to a maximum of about 70 N/mm for the GEF composite system. Similarly, the displacements at failure ($\delta$) measured with a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) were also found to be a strongly sensitive function of the type of reinforcement (GE or GEF) as well as the number of layers.</p>

				<title>Crack propagation studies and bond coat properties in thermal barrier coatings under bending</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0203-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ceramic based thermal barrier coatings (TBC) are currently considered as a candidate material for advanced stationary gas turbine components. Crack propagation studies under bending are described that were performed on plasma sprayed ZrO$_2$, bonded by MCrAlY layer to Ni base superalloy. The crack propagation behaviour of the coatings at room temperature in as received and oxidized conditions revealed a linear growth of the cracks on the coating till the yield point of the super alloy was reached. High threshold load at the interface between the ceramic layer and the bond coat was required to propagate the crack further into the bond coat. Once the threshold load was surpassed the crack propagated into the brittle bond coat without an appreciable increase in the load. At temperatures of 800$^\circ $C the crack propagated only in the TBC (ceramic layer), as the ductile bond coat offered an attractive sink for the stress relaxation. Effects of bond coat oxidation on crack propagation in the interface region have been examined and are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The compressive flow behaviour of lithium aluminosilicate (LAS) glass, with and without SiC particulate reinforcements, was studied. The LAS glass crystallized to $\beta$ spodumene during high-temperature testing. The flow behaviour of LAS glass changed from Newtonian to non-Newtonian due to the presence of crystalline phase. Further, with the addition of 40 vol.% SiC additions, the strain rate sensitivity of flow stress decreased. While the activation energy for flow in LAS was 300 kJ/mole, it increased to 995 kJ/mole with the addition of 40 vol.% SiC reinforcements.</p>

				<title>Effect of filler addition on the compressive and impact properties of glass fibre reinforced epoxy</title>
				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0219-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Flyash is incorporated in glass fibre reinforced epoxies to study their response to the filler addition. Low cost of flyash can reduce the overall cost of the component. Only very low volume fractions of filler are investigated in the present study. To obtain further clarification of the observed phenomenon, another abundantly available low cost material, calcium carbonate is incorporated in one set of the specimens. Compressive strength of the material is found to decrease, whereas steep increase in impact strength is observed by introduction of very small quantity of fillers. Specimens containing calcium carbonate are tested for impact properties only. Effect of specimen aspect ratio on the compressive strength values is also studied by testing specimens of three different aspect ratios. Scanning electron microscopic observations are taken to develop a better understanding of the phenomena taking place in the material system at microscopic level.</p>

				<title>A detailed model for defect concentration and dopant activation in GaAs</title>
				<feature>Semiconductors</feature>
				<page>0225-0229</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Defects in semi-insulating (SI) GaAs are especially critical in determining the properties of devices in which dopants are introduced by ion-implantation. The defects in GaAs are native to the material and their concentrations are subsequently modified after ion-implantation and annealing. In this work, we have extended the existing models in the literature by incorporating a large set of defects and using the most recent values for formation energies of these defects. The model includes eight types of point defects, the vacancy of Ga and As, their antisites and interstitials of Ga and As on both sub-lattices, along with carbon related defects always present in SI–GaAs. We have also included Si and related defects when this element is implanted as an $n$-type dopant. All these defects are considered in several charge states allowed by their stability conditions. The model assumes thermodynamic equilibrium between the point defects at an anneal temperature. Then the GaAs wafer is quenched so that the number of defects remain the same as those at the anneal temperature, but redistribution of charges occurs in various charge states. We find that the defect concentrations are extremely sensitive to the crystal stoichiometry, and good agreement with experimental data is shown. However, when we calculate the dopant activation in implanted GaAs, the quantitative agreement with experiments is not adequate. This discrepancy is explained on the basis of available formation energies for the defects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fatigue properties of a thermomechanically treated 7475 aluminium alloy have been studied in the present investigation. The alloy exhibited superior fatigue life compared to conventional structural aluminium alloys and comparable stage II crack growth rate. It was also noticed that the fatigue crack initiated from a surface grain and the crack extension was dominated by ductile striations. Analysis also revealed that this alloy possessed fracture toughness and tensile properties superior to that noticed with other structural aluminium alloys. Therefore the use of this alloy can safely reduce the overall weight of the aircraft.</p>

					<p>Chloromethylated styrene–divinylbenzene copolymer was chemically modified with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ligand. Catalytically active polymer containing Ru(III) moieties were synthesized from this polymeric ligand. They were characterized using FTIR, UV-vis, SEM, ESR and TGA. Other physico-chemical properties such as bulk density, surface area, moisture content and swelling behaviour in different solvents were also studied. The polymer bound complex was used to study hydrogenation of 1-hexene to $n$-hexane under mild conditions. Influence of [1-hexene], [catalyst], temperature and nature of the solvent on the rate of the reaction was investigated. A rate expression is proposed based on the observed initial rate data. Recycling efficiency of the catalyst has also been studied.</p>

				<title>Role of Fe substitution and quenching rate on the formation of various quasicrystalline and related phases</title>
				<feature>Quasicrystals</feature>
				<page>0257-0264</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated Fe substituted versions of the quasicrystalline (qc) alloy corresponding to Al$_{65}$Cu$_{20}(Cr, Fe)_{15}$ with special reference to the possible occurrence of various quasicrystalline and related phases. Based on the explorations of various compositions it has been found that alloy compositions Al$_{65}$Cu$_{20}$Cr$_{12}$Fe$_3$ and Al$_{65}$Cu$_{20}$Cr$_9$Fe$_6$ exhibit interesting structural phases and features at different quenching rates. At higher quenching rates (wheel speed $\sim$ 25 m/sec) all the alloys exhibit icosahedral phase. For Al$_{65}$Cu$_{20}$Cr$_{12}$Fe$_3$ alloy, however, both the icosahedral and even the decagonal phases get formed at higher quenching rates. At higher quenching rate, alloy having Fe 3 at% exhibits two $bcc$ phases, $bcc$I ($a$ = 8$\cdot$9 Å) and $bcc$II ($a$ = 15$\cdot$45 Å). The orientation relationships between icosahedral and crystalline phases are: Mirror plane $\parallel [001]_{bcc\ I}$ and $[351]_{bcc\ II}$, 5-fold $\parallel [113]_{bcc\ II}$ and 3-fold $\parallel [110]_{bcc\ II}$. At lower quenching rate, the alloy having Fe 6 at% exhibits orthorhombic phase ($a$ = 23$\cdot$6 Å, $b$ = 12$\cdot$4 Å, $c$ = 20$\cdot$1 Å). Some prominent orientation relationships of the orthorhombic phase with decagonal phase have also been reported. At lower quenching rate ($\sim$ 10 m/sec), the alloy (Al$_{65}$Cu$_{22}$Cr$_9$Fe$_6$) shows the presence of diffuse scattering of intensities along quasiperiodic direction of the decagonal phase. For making the occurrence of the sheets of intensities intelligible, a model based on the rotation and shift of icosahedra has been put forward.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A CVD system for the production of continuous SiC fibre was set up. The process of SiC coating on 19 $\mu$m diameter tungsten substrate was studied. Methyl trichloro silane (CH$_3$SiCl$_3$) and hydrogen reactants were used. Effect of substrate temperature (1300–1500$^\circ $C) and concentration of reactants on the formation of SiC coating were studied. SiC coatings of negligible thickness were formed at very low flow rates of hydrogen (5 $\times$ 10$^{–5}$ m$^3$/min) and CH$_3$SiCl$_3$ (1$\cdot$0 $\times$ 10$^{–4}$ m$^3$/min of Ar). Uneven coatings and brittle fibres were formed at very high concentrations of CH$_3$SiCl$_3$  (6 $\times$ 10$^{–4}$ m$^3$/min of Ar). The flow rates of CH$_3$SiCl$_3$  and hydrogen were adjusted to get SiC fibre with smooth surface. The structure and morphology of SiC fibres were evaluated.</p>

					<p>The oxidation behaviour of Zr-based bulk amorphous alloy Zr$_{65}$Cu$_{17$\cdot$5}$Ni$_{10}$Al$_{7$\cdot$5}$ has been studied in air environment at various temperatures in the temperature range 591–684 K using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA).

				<page>0285-0289</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigated the optical properties of silicon clusters and Si nanocrystallites using photoluminescence (PL) and Raman scattering technique. Broad luminescence band in the red region was observed from Si-doped SiO$_2$ thin films deposited by co-sputtering of Si and SiO$_2$ on $p$-type Si (100) substrates, annealed in Ar and O$_2$ atmosphere. Nanocrystalline Si particles fabricated by pulsed plasma processing technique showed infrared luminescence from as grown film at room temperature. Raman spectra from these films consisted of broad band superimposed on a sharp line near 516 cm$^{–1}$  whose intensity, frequency, and width depend on the particle sizes arising from the phonon confinement in the nanocrystalline silicon. We also performed PL, Raman and resonantly excited PL measurements on porous silicon film to compare the optical properties of Si nanostructures grown by different techniques. An extensive computer simulation using empirical pseudopotential method was carried out for 5–18 atoms Si clusters and the calculated gap energies were close to our PL data.</p>

					<p>The optical energy gaps of WS$_2$ single crystal were determined from the analysis of the absorption spectrum near the fundamental absorption edge at room temperature using light parallel to $c$-axis incident normally on the basal plane. On the basis of two- and three-dimensional models it was found that both direct and indirect band transitions took place in WS$_2$  and the indirect transition was of the allowed type.

				<abstract>
					<p>The thermally evaporated stoichiometric CdI$_2$ films show good $c$-axis alignment normal to substrate plane for film thickness up to 200 nm. The optical absorption data indicate an allowed direct interband transition across a gap of 3$\cdot$6 eV in confirmation with earlier band structure calculations. However, part of the absorption data near band edge can be fitted to an indirect band gap of 3 eV. The dependence of band gap on film thickness ($\gt$ 200 nm) can be explained qualitatively in terms of decreasing grain boundary barrier height with grain size.</p>

				<page>0301-0304</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>25%Al-Zn alloy coating performs better than hot dip galvanized coating and 55%Al-Zn-Si coating with regard to general seawater corrosion protection. This study deals with the interfacial intermetallic layer's growth, which affects considerably the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of 25%Al-Zn alloy coatings, by means of three-factor quadratic regressive orthogonal experiments. The regression equation shows that the intermetallic layer thickness decreases rapidly with increasing content of Si added to the Zn-Al alloy bath, increases with rise in the bath temperature and prolonging dip time. The most effective factor that determined the thickness of intermetallic layer was the amount of Si added to Zn-Al alloy bath, while the effect of bath temperature and dip time on the thickness of intermetallic layer were not very obvious.</p>

				<title>Cellular automaton simulation of microstructure evolution during austenite decomposition under continuous cooling conditions</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0305-0312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A two-dimensional diffusion based model is developed to describe transformation of austenite into ferrite and pearlite under continuous cooling conditions. The nucleation of ferrite is assumed to occur over grain boundaries and the nucleation of pearlite is assumed to be taking place all over the grain and at growing ferrite–austenite interfaces, when the composition and temperature conditions are favourable. A cellular automaton algorithm, with transformation rules based on this model is used for the growth of ferrite and pearlite. Model predicted results for continuous cooling transformations are verified by comparing the model predicted microstructure features with the experimental measurements for two sets of plain carbon steels of different composition and austenite grain size. Using the model, it is possible to generate results like undercooling to start ferrite and pearlite transformations, which are difficult to obtain experimentally.</p>

					<p>Compositional and structural information were obtained from an ancient 1600-year old Indian iron using microprobe techniques (EDS, $\mu$XRD and $\mu$PIXE). Several different local locations in the iron matrix and in the entrapped slag inclusions were analyzed. The P content of the metallic iron matrix was very heterogeneous. Lower P contents were observed in the regions near slag inclusions. This was correlated to the dephosphorization capacity of the slag. The crystallized phases identified in the slag inclusions were wüstite and fayalite. The compositions of the slag inclusions were relatively homogeneous.</p>

				<page>0323-0330</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chemically beneficiated high silica/alumina iron ore rejects (27–76% Fe$_2$O$_3$) were used to synthesize iron oxides of purity 96–98% with SiO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ ratio reduced to 0$\cdot$03. The major impurities on chemical beneficiations were Al, Si, and Mn in the range 2–3%. A 99$\cdot$73% purity Fe$_2$O$_3$ was also prepared by solvent extraction method using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) from the acid extracts of the ore rejects. The magnesium ferrite, MgFe$_2$O$_4$, prepared from these synthetic iron oxides showed high resistivity of $\sim$ 10$^8$ ohm cm. All ferrites showed saturation magnetization, 4$piM_s$, in the narrow range of 900–1200 Gauss and the Curie temperature, $T_c$, of all these fell within a small limit of 670 $\pm$ 30 K. All ferrites had low dielectric constants ($\varepsilon'$), 12–15, and low dielectric loss, tan $\delta$, which decreased with the increase in frequency indicating a normal dielectric dispersion found in ferrites. The presence of insignificant amount of polarizable Fe$^{2+}$ ions can be attributed to their high resistances and low dielectric constants. Impurities inherent in the samples had no marked influence on the electrical properties of the ferrites prepared from the iron ore rejects, suggesting the possibility of formation of ferrite of constant composition, MgFe$_2$O$_4$, of low magnetic and dielectric losses at lower temperatures of 1000$^\circ $C by ceramic technique.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Iron oxyhydroxides and hydroxides were synthesized from chemically beneficiated high SiO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ low-grade iron ore (57$\cdot$49% Fe$_2$O$_3$) rejects and heated to get iron oxides of 96–99$\cdot$73% purity. The infrared band positions, isothermal weight loss and thermogravimetric and chemical analysis established the chemical formulas of iron-oxyhydroxides as $\gamma$-FeOOH$\cdot$0$\cdot$3H$_2$O; $\alpha$-FeOOH$\cdot$0$\cdot$2H$_2$O and amorphous FeOOH. The thermal products of all these were $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ excepting that of $\gamma$-FeOOH$\cdot$0$\cdot$3H$_2$O which gave mainly $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and some admixture of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. The hydrazinated iron hydroxides and oxyhydroxides, on the other hand, decomposed autocatalytically to mainly $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. Hydrazine method modifies the thermal decomposition path of the hydroxides. The saturation magnetization, $J_s$, values were found to be in the range 60–71 emu $g^{–1}$ which are close to the reported values for $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. Mechanism of the $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ formation by hydrazine method is discussed.</p>

				<title>Effects and mechanisms of grain refinement in aluminium alloys</title>
				<feature>Metals and Alloys</feature>
				<page>0345-0353</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Grain refinement plays a crucial role in improving characteristics and properties of cast and wrought aluminium alloys. Generally Al–Ti and Al–Ti–B master alloys are added to the aluminium alloys to grain refine the solidified product. The mechanism of grain refinement is of considerable controversy in the scientific literature. The nucleant effects i.e. which particle and its characteristics nucleate $\alpha$-Al, has been the subject of intensive research. Lately the solute effect i.e. the effect of dissolved titanium on grain refinement, has come into forefront of grain refinement research. The present paper attempts to review the literature on the nucleant effects and solute effects on grain refinement and addresses the importance of dissolved titanium in promoting nucleation of $\alpha$-Al on nucleant particles.</p>

				<title>Corrosion behaviour of hot dip zinc and zinc$–$aluminium coatings on steel in seawater</title>
				<feature>Metals and Alloys</feature>
				<page>0355-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comparative investigation of hot dip Zn–25Al alloy, Zn–55Al–Si and Zn coatings on steel was performed with attention to their corrosion performance in seawater. The results of 2-year exposure testing of these at Zhoushan test site are reported here. In tidal and immersion environments, Zn–25Al alloy coating is several times more durable than zinc coating of double thickness. At long exposure times, corrosion rate for the Zn–25Al alloy coating remains indistinguishable from that for the Zn–55Al–Si coating of similar thickness in tidal zone, and is two to three times lower than the latter in immersion zone. The decrease in tensile strength suggested that galvanized and Zn–55Al–Si coated steel suffer intense pitting corrosion in immersion zone. The electrochemical tests showed that all these coatings provide cathodic protection to the substrate metal; the galvanic potentials are equal to – 1,050, – 1,025 and – 880 mV (SCE) for zinc, Zn–25Al alloy and Zn–55Al–Si coating, respectively, which are adequate to keep the steel inside the immunity region. It is believed that the superior performance of the Zn–25Al alloy coating is due to its optimal combination of the uniform corrosion resistance and pitting corrosion resistance. The inferior corrosion performance by comparison of the Zn coating mainly results from its larger dissolution rate, while the failure of the Zn–55Al–Si coating is probably related to its higher susceptibility to pitting corrosion in seawater.</p>

				<title>Processing of low carbon steel plate and hot strip$—$an overview</title>
				<feature>Metals and Alloys</feature>
				<page>0361-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Soaking temperature, drafting schedule, finish rolling and coiling temperatures all play important roles in processing of low carbon plate and strip. They control the kinetics of various physical and metallurgical processes, viz. austenitization, recrystallization and precipitation behaviour. The final transformed microstructures depend upon these processes and their interaction with each other. In view of increasing cost of input materials, new processing techniques such as recrystallized controlled rolling and warm rolling have been developed for production of plates and thinner hot bands with very good deep drawability respectively. Besides hybrid computer modelling is used for production of strip products with tailor made properties. Although there have been few reviews on low carbon microalloyed steels in the past the present one deals with new developments.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of solid–liquid interface profile during continuous casting by a spline based formalism</title>
				<feature>Metals and Alloys</feature>
				<page>0373-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A numerical framework has been applied which comprises of a cubic spline based collocation method to determine the solid–liquid interface profile (solidification front) during continuous casting process. The basis function chosen for the collocation algorithm to be employed in this formalism, is a cubic spline interpolation function. An iterative solution methodology has been developed to track the interface profile for copper strand of rectangular transverse section for different casting speeds. It is based on enthalpy conservation criteria at the solidification interface and the trend is found to be in good agreement with the available information in the literature although a point to point mapping of the profile is not practically realizable. The spline based collocation algorithm is found to be a reasonably efficient tool for solidification front tracking process, as a good spatial derivative approximation can be achieved incorporating simple modelling philosophy which is numerically robust and computationally cost effective.</p>

				<feature>Magnetic Materials</feature>
				<page>0379-0383</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The low temperature sintering of MgCuZn ferrite was investigated using the usual ceramic method. The effect of Cu substitution on the properties of MgZn ferrites was also investigated and it was found that the densification of MgCuZn ferrite is dependent upon Cu concentration. The sintered ferrite with a density of 4$\cdot$93 g/cm$^3$ and electrical resistivity $\gt$ 10$^{11} \Omega$-cm was obtained for the ferrite with 12 mol% Cu at relatively low sintering temperature (910$^\circ $C). The magnetic properties of the ferrites also improved by the Cu substitution. The chip inductors made of the ferrite fired at 910 C with 12 mol% Cu exhibited higher d.c. resistance. From these studies it is concluded that the good quality chip inductor can be obtained using the MgCuZn ferrites.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Poly(2,5-dimethoxyaniline) (PDMOA) and its copolymers with aniline (PADMOA), which exhibit remarkably improved solubility in common organic solvents, were obtained by chemical polymerization, and characterized by a host of physical techniques. The lowering of the quinoid absorption in the IR spectra and the upshifting of the N$_{1s}$ envelope in the XPS spectra indicate residual doping in the XPS polymers and thermal characteristic of the polymers provide evidence for hydrogen bonding, which appear to enhance the thermal stability of the homopolymer. These polymers are highly planar and conjugated, with well-developed polaronic features, shown by the XRD, ESR and UV-spectral data. The conductivity, however, is not high and apparently may be due to localization of polaronic charges at the hydrogen-bonding sites and the increased proportion of the insulating methoxy component in the polymer matrix.</p>

				<title>Mössbauer studies of iron doped poly(methyl methacrylate) before and after ion beam modification</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0397-0400</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High-energy MeV ions from accelerators are known to produce drastic modifications in polymers. The typical effects include chain scissions, crosslinks, molecular emission and double bond formation. Poly(methyl methacrylate) was doped with Fe(III) and irradiated with 95 MeV O$^{7+}$ ions. ${}^{57}$Fe-Mössbauer studies were done on the doped samples before and after irradiation. Before irradiation, no Mössbauer absorption was observed. The irradiated samples showed a good Mössbauer absorption, which seems to indicate that there is a significant interaction between the metal ion and the polymer matrix. Two possibilities exist at these doses ($\sim$ 22 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ ions/cm): Fe(III) ions may be bridging the various polymer segments through crosslinking or amorphization of the sample leading to Fe–C bonding. Studies of FTIR, conductivity and glass transition temperatures on these samples support these observations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present paper charging and discharging transient currents in polyvinyl formal (PVF) were measured as a function of temperatures (40–80$^\circ $C), poling fields (9$\cdot$0 $\times$ 10$^3$–9$\cdot$0 $\times$ 10$^4$ V/cm) and electrode combinations (Al–Al, Au–Al, Zn–Al, Bi–Al, Cu–Al and Ag–Al). The current–time characteristics have different values of slope lying between 0$\cdot$42–0$\cdot$56 and 1$\cdot$42–1$\cdot$63. The polarization is considered to be due to dipolar reorientation associated with structural motions and space charge relaxations due to trapping of injected charge carriers in energetically distributed traps.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>With the aim of developing an ideal bone graft, a new bone grafting material was developed using deglued bone, chitosan and gelatin. Deglued bone (DGB) which is a by-product of bone glue industries and has the close crystallographic similarities of hydroxyapatite was used as main component in the preparation of bone implant. Chitosan was prepared from the exoskeleton of prawn (Pinaeus indicus, family Crustaceae) which is a by-product of seafood industries. Chitosan gives toughness to the product and do not allow the DGB particles to wither away when the implant is placed in the defect. Gelatin was used as binder for the preparation of DGB–chitosan composite. The DGB, chitosan and DGB–chitosan–gelatin composite, which were prepared in the laboratory, were analysed for their physicochemical properties by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy studies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Cholesterol (C$_{27}$H$_{46}$O) is the most abundant and best-known steroid in the animal kingdom. The $in\ vitro$ crystallization of this important biomaterial has been attempted by few researchers. Here we are reporting crystallization of pure cholesterol monohydrate crystals in gel medium. It is found that the morphology of the crystals depends on various parameters. The effect of solvent has been studied in detail. The different morphologies observed are fibrous, needle, platelet, dendrite etc. Micro topographical studies have been made and it is found that the crystals grow, at least in the last stage, by spreading of layers. However, at initial stage microcrystals formed and developed into dendrite or needle forms. These one-dimensional crystals developed into platelets and finally thickened. Further studies reveal that micro impurities play a vital role in the development of these crystals as seen by dissolution figures on the crystals. These crystals are characterized by using the XRD and IR spectroscopic methods.</p>

				<title>Crystallization of mixed rare earth (didymium) molybdates in silica gel</title>

				<page>0435-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Experiments on the growth of mixed rare earth (didymium$—$a combination of La, Nd, Pr and Sm) molybdates in silica gel medium are reported. The optimum conditions conducive for the growth of these crystals are described and discussed. Concentration programming is reported to enhance the size of crystals by two-fold; the maximum size obtained being about 1 mm$^3$. EDAX results suggest the crystals to be heptamolybdates of type R$_2$Mo$_7$O$_{24}$, bearing composition La$_{1$\cdot$23}$Nd$_{0$\cdot$43}$Pr$_{0$\cdot$29}$ Sm$_{0$\cdot$05}$Mo$_7$O$_{24}$. The didymium molybdate crystals assume morphologies corresponding to those of spherulites, platelets, cuboids and coalesced crystals. Twinned structure in didymium molybdate crystals are also reported. It is explained that spherulitic morphologies result from aggregates of crystals joining in a spherical envelope. It is suggested that the crystals of didymium molybdates grow by two-dimensional spreading and piling up of layers.</p>

					<p>Ni$_x$Mg$_{1–x}$SO$_4$⋅7H$_2$O single crystals were grown by the slow evaporation method from aqueous solutions. Density was measured by the floatation method. X-ray diffraction data were collected for powder samples and used for the estimation of lattice variation and thermal parameters like Debye–Waller factor, mean-square amplitude of vibration and Debye temperature. Lattice volumes approximately obey a relation similar to Retger’s rule. Values of thermal parameters do not follow any particular order with composition. The results obtained are reported.</p>

					<p>Single crystals of calcium iodate and barium iodate were grown by simple gel technique by single diffusion method. The optimum conditions were established by varying various parameters such as pH of gel solution, gel concentration, gel setting time, concentration of the reactants etc. Crystals having different morphologies and habits were obtained. Prismatic, dendritic crystals of barium iodate and prismatic, needle shaped, hopper crystals of calcium iodate were obtained. Some of them were transparent, some transluscent, and few others were opaque. Both the crystals were studied using XRD, FT-IR, and thermal analysis. The crystals were doped by iron impurity. The effect of doping was studied using IR spectroscopy and thermal analysis.</p>

					<p>Microhardness measurements were undertaken on twelve rare earth garnet crystals. In yttrium aluminium garnet and gadolinium gallium garnet, there was no measurable difference in the hardness values of pure and nominally Nd-doped crystals. The hardness values were correlated with the lattice and elastic constants. An analysis of hardness data in terms of the interatomic binding indicated a high degree of covalency.</p>

					<p>The growth of Sb-based crystals (InSb, GaSb etc) was undertaken using resistive heater furnace by vertical directional solidification (VDS) technique. Crystal–melt interface shape during the growth was shown to convert from concave to convex along the crystal axis of the ingots. Many antimonide (Sb) crystals of 8 mm to 18 mm diameter were grown by optimized growth parameters. The forced convection and absence of conducting support to ampoule showed improvement in crystal quality of as grown ingots. Crystals showed preferred orientation and self-seeding. Results on interface shape and crystallinity of ingots were found to be in good agreement with the experiments.</p>

					<p>The solid solutions of Sn$_{1–x}$Ti$_x$O$_2$ (0 0 &lt; $x$ &lt; 0$\cdot$25) were prepared by the usual high temperature ceramic processing techniques with small amounts of dopants such as Nb, Co, Al. The electrical measurements (log $I$–log $V$) on the ohmically metal electroded sintered pellets showed the non-linear behaviour. The nonlinear coefficient was found to decrease from 12 to 3 with increase in $x$. On the other hand, the breakdown voltage ($E_b$) showed the increase with the increase in $x$. This complex electrical behaviour is explained on the effects of the three dopants (as varistor former, performance enhancer and highlighter) on the microstructural features of the dense pellet.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Dielectric properties such as dielectric constant ($\varepsilon'$) and dielectric loss tangent (tan $\delta$) of mixed Mn–Zn–Er ferrites having the compositional formula Mn$_{0\cdot58}$Zn$_{0\cdot37}$Fe$_{2\cdot05–x}$Er$_x$O$_4$ (where $x$ = 0$\cdot$2, 0$\cdot$4, 0$\cdot$6, 0$\cdot$8 and 1$\cdot$0) were measured at room temperature in the frequency range 1–13 MHz using a HP 4192A impedance analyser. Plots of dielectric constant ($\varepsilon'$) vs frequency show a normal dielectric behaviour of spinel ferrites. The frequency dependence of dielectric loss tangent (tan $\delta$) was found to be abnormal, giving a peak at certain frequency for all mixed Mn–Zn–Er ferrites. A qualitative explanation is given for the composition and frequency dependence of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent. Plots of dielectric constant vs temperature have shown a transition near the Curie temperature for all the samples of Mn–Zn–Er ferrites. However, Mn$_{0\cdot58}$Zn$_{0\cdot37}$Er$_{1\cdot0}$Fe$_{1\cdot05}$O$_4$ does not show a transition. On the basis of these results an explanation for the dielectric mechanism in Mn–Zn–Er ferrites is suggested.</p>

					<p>Magnetic sub-micron sized particles (with diameters in the range 100–600 nm) of Co, Ni and Co–Ni alloys, protected with polyvinylpyrrolidone have been prepared in gram quantities using the polyol process. Experiments carried out with different metal precursors and starting compositions have yielded reliable routes to produce particles of the desired diameters in the 100–600 nm range. The particles were characterized with X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and magnetic measurements. The particles are found to be stable under ambient conditions indefinitely. The coercivity values of the Co and Ni particles are $\sim$ 50% higher compared to the corresponding bulk values. The alloy particles follow a trend similar to the bulk alloys.</p>

Bulk polycrystalline samples have been prepared by the two-step solid state reaction process (precursor route). It has been observed that the as grown H$g$Bi$_{0\cdot2–x}$Tl$_x$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (with $x$ = 0$\cdot$00, 0$\cdot$05, 0$\cdot$10, 0$\cdot$15, 0$\cdot$20) corresponds to the 1223 phase. It has been found that the $T_c$ varies with the average cationic size $\langle R_d \rangle$ of the dopantcations. The optimum $T_c$ of $\sim$ 131 K has been found for the composition H$g$Bi$_{0\cdot15}$Tl$_{0\cdot05}$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$. This composition leads to the average dopant cation size of $\sim$ 1$\cdot$108 Å which is very close to the size of H$g^{2+}$($\sim$ 1$\cdot$11 Å). The microstructure for H$g$Bi$_{0\cdot15}$Tl$_{0\cdot05}$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ has been found to be most dense and this phase exhibits the highest stability. The $J_c$ of the optimum material H$g$Bi$_{0\cdot15}$Tl$_{0\cdot05}$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ is found to be $\sim$ 1$\cdot$29 $\times$ 10$^3$ A/cm$^2$ at 77 K.</p>

				<page>0529-0534</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Physical and chemical responses of 70 MeV carbon ion irradiated Kapton-H polymer were studied by using UV-visible, FTIR and XRD techniques. The ion fluences ranging from 9$\cdot$3 $\times$ 10$^{11}$–9 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ ions cm$^{–2}$ were used. Recorded UV-visible spectra clearly showed a decrease in absorption initially with fluence, but for the higher fluences it showed a recovery characteristic. A decrease in band-gap energy of 0$\cdot$07 eV was observed. The FTIR analysis indicated the high resistance to radiation induced degradation of polymer. The diffraction pattern of Kapton-H indicates that this polymer is semi-crystalline in its nature. In case of irradiated one, there was an average increase of crystallite size by 20%, but diffuse pattern indicates that there was a decrease in crystallinity, which may be attributed to the formation of complex structure induced by the cross-linking of the polymeric chains.</p>

					<p>Interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) of glycerol modified castor oil polyurethane (GC–PU) and poly[2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate] (PHEMA) were synthesized using benzoyl peroxide as initiator and N,N-methylene $bis$ acrylamide as crosslinker. GC–PU/PHEMA interpenetrating polymer networks were obtained by transfer moulding. These were characterized with respect to their resistance to chemical reagents and mechanical properties such as tensile strength, per cent elongation and shore A hardness. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were undertaken for thermal characterization. The changes in NCO/OH ratio and GC–PU/PHEMA composition on the properties of the IPNs were studied.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal history of droplets associated with gas atomization of melt has been investigated. A mathematical model, based on classical theory of heterogeneous nucleation and volume separation of nucleants among droplets size distribution, is described to predict undercooling of droplets. Newtonian heat flow condition coupled with velocity dependent heat transfer coefficient is used to obtain cooling rate before and after nucleation of droplets. The results indicate that temperature profile of droplets in the spray during recalescence, segregated and eutectic solidification regimes is dependent on their size and related undercooling. The interface temperature during solidification of undercooled droplets rapidly approaches the liquidus temperature of the alloy with a subsequent decrease in solid–liquid interface velocity. A comparison in cooling rates of atomized powder particles estimated from secondary dendrite arm spacing measurements are observed to be closer to those predicted from the model during segregated solidification regime of large size droplets. </p>

				<title>Possibility of improvement of potentiodynamic method for monitoring corrosion rate of steel reinforcement in concrete</title>
				<feature>Corrosion Studies</feature>
				<page>0555-0558</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quantitative data on corroding steel reinforcement in reinforced concrete structures are undoubtedly very useful for evaluation of their service life and timely repairs. The method of electrode potential measurement is a convenient and simple test for this purpose, but it provides no quantitative data on corrosion rate and only information regarding active or passive state of steel reinforcement can be obtained. We show here the possibility of obtaining quantitative data on degree of corrosion of steel reinforcement by a potentiodynamic method. The developed method is based on experimentally estimated mathematical relation between the results of potentiodynamic method and degree of corrosion of steel reinforcement. It is possible to calculate the degree of corrosion of steel reinforcement using this mathematical relation and the measured values of current density by the potentiodynamic method.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nanocomposites of polypyrrole and iron oxide were prepared using simultaneous gelation and polymerization processes. Varied amounts of pyrrole monomer were added to a solution containing iron nitrate as precursor and 2-methoxy ethanol as solvent. The presence of oxide and polypyrrole was confirmed by using X-ray and FTIR techniques. Some of these nanocomposites exhibited magnetic behaviour. SEM studies of powders indicated presence of nanosized particles. Electrical conductivity studies of powders showed a slight variation in conductivity for lower concentration of pyrrole, with a sudden increase in conductivity at 15% of pyrrole concentration. A transition from a nonmagnetic to magnetic phase was also observed at the same concentration.</p>

					<p>The corrosion resistant oxide coatings, developed and applied by the conventional vitreous enamelling techniques, showed superior resistance to a range of mineral acids at various strengths and temperatures, alkaline solutions, boiling water and chrome plating solutions. These coatings possess considerable abrasion and impact resistance as well as high thermal shock resistance. The properties of the coating system have been studied in detail and found to be strongly dependent on composition and processing parameters. These coatings have been characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis and SEM studies. Some of the coating materials have been found to be biocompatible.</p>

				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0583-0586</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sm–Ru intermetallic surface alloy films were prepared by vacuum deposition and annealing of rare earth Sm on single crystal Ru(0001) surface. The Ru $3d$ and Sm $3d$ core level spectra clearly show the formation of surface alloy layers. XPS measurements on surface alloy film revealed an induced peak in the Ru $3d$ region at lower binding energy by 1 eV compared to the bulk Ru (elemental) suggesting an electronic effect of alloying and Sm–Ru bond formation. The Sm $3d_{5/2}$ photoemission peak of Sm film consists of strong features characteristic of Sm(II) with electron configuration $4f^6$ $(5d\ 6s)^2$ and Sm(III) with electron configuration $4f^5$ $(5d\ 6s)^3$. It is observed that the Sm(II) feature decreases in intensity upon alloy formation with surface Ru atoms. Oxidation of these films with carbon monoxide indicates alloy breakdown due to the oxidation of Sm atoms selectively. Alloy oxidation also shows a clear shift of Sm $3d_{5/2}$ feature.</p>

					<p>In the present work, tracking phenomena has been studied with the ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) material under the a.c. and d.c. voltages, with ammonium chloride/acid rain solution as the contaminant. It is noticed that the tracking time depends on the conductivity and flow rate of the contaminant. The physico-chemical analyses viz. wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), thermo-gravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies, were carried out and it was concluded that the tracking process is a surface degradation process. The tracking time is different for a.c. and d.c. voltages.</p>

				<page>0595-0601</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis of H$g$(Tl)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ superconducting tapes have been accomplished by annealing the precursor tape, Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (fabricated by doctor blade tape casting technique) in an environment of H$g$(Tl) vapour. Characterization of superconducting HTSC tape sample was carried out through XRD, TEM, SEM and R–T measurements. Surface morphological investigations of the as-synthesized H$g$(Tl)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ HTSC tapes by scanning electron microscope have shown the occurrence of curious growth characteristics resembling spiral like features. These growth spirals encompass nearly the whole grain suggesting that spiral growth led to the formation of small crystal like grains of superconducting material H$g$(Tl)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$. The likely mechanism for the generation of these screw dislocations has been elucidated in terms of incoherent coalescence of growth fronts formed from H$g$(Tl):1223 and H$g$(Tl):1234 nuclei.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Bulk tube conductors of Bi$_{1\cdot84}$Pb$_{0\cdot4}$Sr$_2$Ca$_{2\cdot2}$Cu$_3$O$_{10+x}$ with addition of silver varying from 0 to 25 wt% (not reported earlier) were systematically studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrical transport and a.c. susceptibility techniques. The tube conductors formed by cold isostatic pressing (CIP) of the powders obtained from spray drying method have been made successfully. It was found that Ag addition has not only affected the formation of the desired Bi-2223 phase and the microstructure of these large bulk tube samples thereby influencing on the critical current ($I_c$), it also reduces the contact resistance to minimize the cryogen losses. These variations have been found to be Ag content dependent. An optimized value of 10 wt% Ag has been found to produce the best quality tubes showing reproducible $I_c$ value $\gt$ 120 Amp at 77 K which is in general a requirement to energies of the cryogen free conventional/HTSC superconducting magnets below 20 K.</p>

				<title>A study of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation on polycrystalline Ni–Zn ferrites</title>
				<feature>Magnetic Materials</feature>
				<page>0611-0616</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Polycrystalline NiZn ferrites with different grain sizes (1$\cdot$2 $\mu$m to 10$\cdot$2 $\mu$m) were prepared by the usual ceramic method. The magnetic properties were measured at room temperature. The ultrasonic velocity and attenuation were measured on Ni–Zn ferrite by using the pulse transmission method at 1 MHz, in the temperature range 300–600 K. The velocity was found to be slightly sample dependent at room temperature and decreased with increasing temperature, except near the Curie temperature, $T_c$, where a small anomaly was observed. The longitudinal attenuation ($\alpha_l$) at room temperature was found to be more sample dependent. The temperature variation of ultrasonic longitudinal attenuation exhibited a broad maximum around 400 K and a sharp maximum just below Curie temperature ($T_c$). The above observations were carried out in the demagnetized state. The application of a 380 mT magnetic field allowed us to reach the saturated state of the sample at all the measuring temperatures. The anomaly observed in the thermal variation of velocities (longitudinal and transverse) and attenuation has been qualitatively explained with the help of the temperature variation of the magneto-crystalline anisotropy constant.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new combustion route for the synthesis of $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is reported by employing purified $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ as aprecursor in the present investigation. This synthesis which is similar to a self propagation combustion reaction, involves fewer steps, a shorter overall processing time, is a low energy reaction without the need of any explosives, and also the reaction is completed in a single step yielding magnetic iron oxide i.e. $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. The as synthesized $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is characterized employing thermal, XRD, SEM, magnetic hysteresis, and density measurements. The effect of ball-milling on magnetic properties is also presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Rubber ferrite composites containing various mixed ferrites were prepared for different compositions and various loadings. The magnetic and dielectric properties of the fillers as well as the ferrite filled matrixes were evaluated separately. The results are correlated. Simple equations are proposed to predetermine the magnetic and dielectric properties. The validity of these equations is verified and they are found to be in good agreement. These equations are useful in tailoring the magnetic and dielectric properties of these composites with predetermined properties.</p>

				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0633-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simple method for the analysis of stainless steel samples is presented which is based on radioisotope excited energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry and does not require any type-standards. Both absorption and enhancement effects have been taken into account in the fundamental parameter method for quantitative analysis and an iterative approach is followed for calculation of concentrations in steel samples. Non-linear least square fitting (NL-LSF) procedures have been used to determine accurately the fluorescent peak intensities. The method has been tested by analysing several CRM standard reference samples and 304 and 316 steel samples assuming as unknown. The EDXRF results have also been compared with the results of analysis of same samples by vacuum emission spark spectrometry (VES). Obtained values for concentration in steel samples match quite well with their certified values.</p>

					<p>The interface of Fe$_3$Al/Q235 dissimilar materials joint, which was made by vacuum diffusion welding, combines excellently. There are Fe$_3$Al, FeAl phases and $\alpha$-Fe (Al) solid solution at the interface of Fe$_3$Al/Q235. Aluminum content decreases from 28% to 1$\cdot$5% and corresponding phase changes from Fe$_3$Al with DO$_3$ type body centred cubic ($bcc$) structure to $\alpha$-Fe (Al) solid solution with B2 type $bcc$ structure. All phases are present in sub-grain structure level and there is no obvious brittle phases or micro-defects such as pores and cracks at the interface of Fe$_3$Al/Q235 diffusion joint.</p>

				<title>Effect of zirconium addition on the recrystallization behaviour of a commercial Al–Cu–Mg alloy</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0643-0648</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well known that the second phase particles have an effect on recrystallization and grain growth behaviour of an alloy. Particularly the bimodal distribution of second phase particles has an effect which is opposite in sense where coarse second phase particles ($\gt$ 1 $\mu$m) stimulate nucleation while fine particles exhibit Zener drag.</p>
					<p>In the literature, the effect of zirconium addition to aluminium alloys has been well documented in order to produce superplasticity by giving ultra fine grain size to the alloy. Addition of zirconium produces Al$_3$Zr particles which pin the grain boundaries during recrystallization and grain growth.</p>
					<p>In the present work, zirconium was added to a commercial Al–Cu–Mg alloy and by heat treatment Al$_3$Zr particles were precipitated and after forging, the grain size was an order of magnitude lower than the alloy without zirconium.</p>
					<p>Transmission electron microscopy was employed to characterize the second phase particles, i.e. Al$_3$Zr particles and found to be rod shaped and identified to be cubic ordered $L1_2$ phase with a lattice parameter of 0$\cdot$408 nm. Further, it was observed that fine (100 nm) Al$_3$Zr particles promote only continuous recrystallization which is polygonization of subgrains and subgrain growth.</p>
					<p>It was found that the fine dispersion of Al$_3$Zr particles inhibits both recrystallization and grain growth in the commercial Al–Cu–Mg alloy.</p>

					<p>Two bioceramics (Ca–P–O glass and A–W glass ceramic) were produced using conventional methods of ceramic technology. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were used for identifying the phases and 3-point bend test was carried out for the determination of fracture strength of the bioceramics. Biocompatibility of both ceramics was evaluated using animal model experiments. Histological studies showed that A–W glass ceramic implanted in the tibia of rat formed an intimate contact with newly grown bone and provided enough strength to the bone to bear the animal weight. Implants made of Ca–P–O glass was almost fully resorbed and was replaced by new bone. The implants made of both the bioceramics were biocompatible and did not exhibit any kind of adverse effect to the surrounding tissues.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>One of the most pressing issues in the growth of high quality single crystal Cd$_{0\cdot96}$Zn$_{0\cdot04}$Te material, is to achieve homogenization of the high axial variation of Zn concentration, caused by the larger than unity segregation coefficient of Zn in CdTe. This is achieved in our crystals</p>

						<li>by thermal annealing of the CdZnTe crystal, which redistributes the as grown Zn distribution by solid state diffusion of Zn (this solid state diffusion of Zn occurs at three stages

						<li>by the reduction of Zn segregation during the growth stage by enhanced convective mixing of the melt, through a proper choice of ampoule and furnace dimensions.</li>

					<p>Single crystals of sodium bromate are grown at various supersaturations ranging from 3% to 8%. Surface studies have been carried out on as-grown and etched (111) faces of these crystals. Typical and systematically oriented growth hillocks are observed almost on all the faces. Further dislocation studies are made to understand the growth history of these crystals. These studies suggest that the crystals grow by 2D-growth mechanism. In addition to this, studies are also conducted on the formation of overgrowths and inclusions in these crystals.</p>

					<p>Stable nanoclusters of Cu were synthesized using Langmuir–Blodgett films of octadecylsuccinic acid (ODSA) as template. The Langmuir–Blodgett films of ODSA formed from subphase containing copper ions were first subjected to sulphidation (S) using sodium sulphide and then hydrogenated (H) using hydrogen gas. Diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy (DIR-UV-vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) used to characterize these films indicated the formation of Cu(0) metallic clusters ranging in size from 3 $\sim$ 10 nm.</p>

				<title>Cell attachment on diamond-like carbon coating</title>
				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0007-0013</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Preliminary results of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating with its novel properties with no toxicity have caused a strong interest of commercial manufacturers of surgical implants. DLC coatings were prepared on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) at room temperature using ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD). It could be shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy that DLC coating prepared by 800 eV CH$^{n+}$ beam bombardment possessed a higher fraction of $sp^3$ bonds in the structure of mixed $sp^3$ + $sp^2$ bonding, resulting in a higher hydrophobicity. The results of the cell attachment tests indicated that DLC coatings exhibited low macrophage attachment and provided desirable surface for the normal cellular growth and morphology of the fibroblasts. At the same time, the number of both neutral granulocytes and platelets adhering to DLC coatings decreased significantly. These findings showed that DLC was a better coating with desirable tissue and blood compatibility.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, microstructure and mechanical properties of ceria stabilized tetragonal zirconia prepared by spray drying technique</title>
				<feature>Mechanical Properties</feature>
				<page>0015-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ceria stabilized zirconia powders with ceria concentration varying from 6 to 16 mol% were synthesized using spray drying technique. Powders were characterized for their particle size distribution and specific surface area. The dense sintered ceramics fabricated using these powders were characterized for their microstructure, crystallite size and phase composition. The flexural strength, fracture toughness and microhardness of sintered ceramics were measured. High fracture toughness and flexural strength were obtained for sintered bodies with 12 mol% of CeO$_2$. Flexural strength and fracture toughness were dependent on CeO$_2$ concentration, crystallite size and phase composition of sintered bodies. Correlation of data has indicated that the transformable tetragonal phase is the key factor in controlling the fracture toughness and strength of ceramics. It has been demonstrated that the synthesis method is effective to prepare nanocrystalline tetragonal ceria stabilized zirconia powders with improved mechanical properties. Ce–ZrO$_2$ with 20 wt% alumina was also prepared with flexural strength, 1200 MPa and fracture toughness, 9$\cdot$2 MPa $\surd$m.</p>

				<title>Surface modification on PMMA : PVDF polyblend: hardening under chemical environment</title>
				<feature>Mechanical Properties</feature>
				<page>0021-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The influence of chemical environment on polymers include the surface alteration as well as other deep modifications in surface layers. The surface hardening, as an effect of organic liquids on poly(methyl methacrylate): poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PMMA: PVDF), which is one of the few known miscible blends, has been detected using microhardness testing. Organic liquids like acetone, toluene, xylene and benzene were introduced on the surface of blend specimens for different durations. Vickers microhardness ($H_v$) was measured for treated and untreated specimens. The study reveals both hardening and plasticization of specimens at different exposure times. The degree of surface hardening is maximum under acetone treatment. All the specimens exhibit surface hardening at an exposure time of 1 h with all the four liquids. This feature is prominent with longer exposures for specimens with increasing content of PVDF. However, the degree of hardening decreases with the time of exposure in the respective environments. In general, acetone and toluene impart surface hardening, whereas, xylene and benzene soften the specimen. PMMA: PVDF (83 : 17) blend exhibits surface hardening under all the four treatments when compared with the respective untreated specimens.</p>

					<p>Dried $Musa\ paradiciaca$ (banana) stem and veins of the leaves, which were hitherto discarded as a waste, were collected and used as starting material for the preparation of cellulose and cellulose acetate. This cellulose acetate was mixed with polystyrene to form blend of cellulose acetate–polystyrene in order to provide enhanced stability and extended utility to the end products. The films of these composites or their individual partners were made separately and studied for their mechanical properties, chemical modification and morphological changes. We report here that banana stem is good source of cellulose and that cellulose completely undergoes modification upon esterification.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the dielectric properties of fly ash. The dielectric measurements were performed as a function of frequency and temperature. The sample of fly ash shows almost similar behaviour in the frequency and temperature range studied. The large value of dielectric constant in the typical frequency range is because of orientation polarization and tight binding force between the ions or atoms in the fly ash. The sample of fly ash is of great scientific and technological interest because of its high value of dielectric constant (10$^4$).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Single crystals of tetraethylammonium tetrachlorocobaltate were grown by solution method and characterized through single crystal X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetric studies (DSC) and infrared spectroscopic technique (IR). The crystals were bright, transparent and blue coloured. The unit cell parameters were found to be $a$ = $b$ = 9$\cdot$0363 Å and $c$ = 14$\cdot$9879 Å and $\alpha$ = $\beta$ = $\gamma$ = 90$^\circ $, showing tetragonal lattice from the XRD data. Thermogravimetric analysis showed a loss of weight at 683 K from which the decomposition reaction was formulated. Thermal anomalies were found for this crystal at temperatures 200 K, 220 K in the cooling cycle and at temperatures 200 K, 240 K in the heating cycle, respectively which showed that this crystal was associated with first order phase transition. All the vibrational frequencies corresponding to (TEA)$^+$ ions and CoCl$^{2-}_4$ ions were assigned from the IR spectral data of this crystal.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of AISI 321 stainless steel in acidic chloride solution was studied by slow strain rate (SSR) technique and fracture mechanics method. The fractured surface was characterized by cleavage fracture. In order to clarify the SCC mechanism, the effects of inhibitor KI on SCC behaviour were also included in this paper. A study showed that the inhibition effects of KI on SCC were mainly attributed to the anodic reaction of the corrosion process. The results of strain distribution in front of the crack tip of the fatigue pre-cracked plate specimens in air, in the blank solution (acidic chloride solution without inhibitor KI) and in the solution added with KI measured by speckle interferometry (SPI) support the unified mechanism of SCC and corrosion fatigue cracking (CFC).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The changes with time in the corrosion rate and corrosion current density on a cast iron electrode in various aqueous salt solutions have been carried out using total immersion test and potentiostatic polarization curves. The concentration of salts taken is expected to be present in potable water. The relative behaviour of these salts towards corrosion has also been studied, which is found to be different from previous studies. The total immersion test parameters viz. weight loss, corrosion rate as well as potentiostatic parameters, open circuit potential, $I_{corr}$, Tafel slopes, corrosion rate, have been calculated by standard methods. Besides these the relative increase in corrosion rate with time as well as the percentage to which corrosion rate should be decreased so as to provide protection towards corrosion have also been calculated. It was found that KCl and NaCl are major contributors than MnSO$_4$, Pb(NO$_3$)$_2$, KI and KBr. The relative increase in corrosion is high in KBr, KI, NaNO$_3$, CaCl$_2$, and less in Pb(NO$_3$)$_2$, NaHCO$_3$ and CaCO$_3$ test solutions. For the reliability of results the data has been statistically analysed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Cu$^{2+}$ ion doped silica gel matrices in monolithic shape were prepared by hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). The absorption, transmittance and fluorescence spectra of the gel matrices heat treated at different temperatures were monitored. The loss of water and hydroxyl group from silica network changes the optical properties of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions in the host, noted by the change in colour of monolith and spectral characteristics. The pronounced blue shift observed (700–900 nm to 600–850 nm) for the broad band of the absorption spectra of the samples heated up to 700$^\circ $C is attributed to the ligand field splitting and partial removal of hydroxyl group from the silica matrices. The results indicate broadband filtering effects of the samples in the wavelength region 400–600 nm. Absorption and fluorescence spectra of the glass matrices heated to 1000$^\circ $C confirms the conversion of Cu$^{2+}$ ion to Cu$^+$ ion.</p>

				<title>Preparation of high purity tellurium by zone refining</title>
				<feature>Materials Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0079-0083</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes purification process of tellurium metal using zone refining technique under high purity hydrogen gas ambient in normal room environment. Process automation by newly designed stepper motor drive and allied process control instruments circumvent the complexity of electrical motors. It is observed that overall impurities have gone down substantially from 4N+ to 5N5 purity with reference to Fe, Mg, Al, Cr, Zn, Bi and Cu. Removal of selenium is effected by hydrogen, which also serves as carrier gas during zone refining. The selenium in tellurium matrix is found to be below detection limits. The zone temperature, zone length and tilt angle maintained in the experiment are adequate to go down to high purity levels.</p>

				<title>Photoelectronic properties of HgI$_2$ crystals for nuclear radiation detection</title>
				<feature>Materials Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0085-0093</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photoelectronic properties of red mercuric iodide single crystals, grown from its saturated solution in tetrahydrofuran, have been studied for the wavelength range 450-700 nm at temperatures 80, 110, 175, 235 and 300 K. Various aspects of the optical generation of charge carriers have been discussed. The computer simulation of the room temperature photoconductivity has generated the optimized values of the mobility-lifetime products ($\mu_e\tau_e$ = 5$\cdot$67 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/V, $\mu_h\tau_h$ = 0$\cdot$18 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/V), and surface recombination velocities ($S_e$ = 3$\cdot$2 $\times$ 10$^5$ cm/s, $S_h$ = 4$\cdot$5 $\times$ 10$^5$ cm/s) of the charge carriers in these crystals. The estimated values of the electron and hole drift lengths for typical electric fields suggest that, under the negative electrode illumination, THF $\alpha$-HgI$_2$ crystals have high potential as regards to their use as phptodetectors in most of the scintillation spectrometers.</p>

					<p>The characteristics of a magnetic sensor, based on the non-linear electromagnetic response of the weak links present in polycrystalline BPSCCO superconductor are reported. The second harmonic response of the sensor in an alternating magnetic field at 40 kHz and at 77 K being a strong linear function of low d.c. field is utilized for magnetic field sensing. The noise limited resolution of the sensor is found to be 3$\cdot$16 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$ T/$\surd$Hz for $H_{a.c.}$ = 16 G and frequency 40 kHz. The magnetic sensor has been applied for non-destructive detection of various types of flaws in ferromagnetic plates and also for detection of small magnetic inclusions in a non-magnetic matrix. Our results suggest that the 2$f$ response based BPSCCO superconductive magnetometer has potential for its appication in the area of non-destructive evaluation of defects in ferromagnetic materials.</p>

				<title>Fretting fatigue in AISI 1015 steel</title>
				<feature>Steels and Alloys</feature>
				<page>0109-0114</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A small osillatory movement between two contacting surfaces is termed as fretting and on many occasions it acts as the crack initiation site leading to catastrophic failure of the overall structure. The occurrence of fretting is observed in many engineering structures such as shaft flanges, gas turbines, steel ropes etc. An experimental facility, which can simulate the fretting fatigue in many engineering applications, is the primary requirement of the research program. A laboratory fretting fatigue test facility capable of varying many influencing parameters of fretting fatigue such as slip amplitutde, frequency, contact pressure, etc is designed and developed. Preliminary investigations on plain and fretting fatigue behaviour of AISI 1015 structural steel are reported in this paper. A strength reduction factor of about 1$\cdot$30 was obtained due to fretting for the test material under the present experimental conditions. Influence of contact load on fretting was also studied. Increasing fretting contact load decreased the fatigue life in the range investigated. Failure analysis showed typical stage I oblique crack growth followed by stage II straight crack perpedicular to the fretting zone.</p>

				<page>0115-0119</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Boehmite sols were obtained by peptizing boehmite precipitates with glacial acetic acid. The sols were aged at room temperature (30 $\pm$ 1$\circ $C) under closed condition. Rheological properties of the sols were studied at different ageing times. The sol characteristics were interpreted by measuring their viscosity, areas of hysteresis of the flow curves and yield stress ($\tau_y$). Viscosity and the area of hysteresis of the flow curves increased with increasing ageing time of the sols. A sharp change of yield stress was observed during the ageing period from 15 to 36 days. The change in viscous to elastic nature and the appearance of gel point of the sol was observed by studying their oscillatory flow behaviour, i.e. by measuring loss modulus ($G''$), elastic modulus ($G'$), and loss tangent (tan $\delta$) of the sols. Gel point of boehmite sol was found at 36 days of ageing under closed condition at room temperature (30 $\pm$ 1$^\circ $C).</p>

				<title>Evaluation of thermal shock resistance of cordierite honeycombs</title>
				<feature>Ceramic Materials</feature>
				<page>0127-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comparative study on thermal shock resistance (TSR) of extruded cordierite honeycombs is presented. TSR is an important property that predicts the life of these products in thermal environments used for automobile pollution control as catalytic converter or as diesel particulate filter. TSR was experimentally studied by quenching (descending test) the heated samples to water or by heating (ascending test) with an oxyhydrogen flame along with crack detection by acoustic emission (AE) method. TSR was also calculated by using coefficient of themal expasion (CTE), modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) of the honeycomb samples. Cordierite honeycombs of 200 and 400 cpsi were used for the above study. It was observed that the trends of TSR were same for both the experimental methods as well as by calculation. The ascending test method showed lower TSR values compared to water quench method due to early detection of cracks by AE. Finite element method (FEM) was also used to evaluate the thermal stress distribution in solid cordierite using thermal shock test data. It was observed that the maximum thermal stress calculated by FEM was lower than the strength of the material; therefore, the solid cordierite did not fail during such tests.</p>

				<title>Analysis of filler--fibre interaction in fly ash filled short fibre$-$epoxy composites using ultrasonic NDE</title>
				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0137-0140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Size and aspect ratio are believed to influence the rheology or the flow in the mixture and in turn the mechanical performance of the composites. Fillers and fibres when used in combination are expected to complement each other's performance resulting in better properties for the composite. They also reduce the extent of matrix polymer required in the system. Composites involving fillers and fibres individually and in combination are studied for the level defect population using NDE and the mechanical performance under compression correlated with such an analysis. It was found that inclusion filler-fibre combination besides yielding better physical properties like density also yielded improved mechanical properties like strength and modulus. These properties showed an improvement of about 30-40% as compared to the ones where a single reinforcement either ash or fibre was used. Further, they exhibited uniform distribution of defects whose population was least compared to the situation where only one component (either filler or fibre) as reinforcement was tried.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This study evaluated the tissue reaction to porous hydroxyapatite (HA) granules in a critical sized tibial-defect of New Zealand white rabbits for a period of 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Physicochemical characterizations of the granules were done using transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to analyse the microstrucutre, composition, phase purity crystallinity and functional groups of HA. Prior to $in\ vivo$ testing, the HA granules had proved to be biocompatible and cytocompatible $en\ route\ in\ vitro$ studies using L929 mouse fibroblast cells. In the histologic evaluation, as early as 2 weeks, bone ingrowth was observed in the pores and interstices of the granules forming a network of bony trabeculae and over 6, 12 and 24 weeks, it was seen that the granules assisted in bone formation. Fluorochrome multilabels of yellow, red and orange lines showed active sites of bone mineralization in progress in the pores and periphery of the granules. Good osteointegration of the granules with the host bone was observed. There was neither inflammation nor fibreous tissue interposition while resorption of the material was in effect a slow process, since the HA granules still persisted after 24 weeks.</p>

				<page>0155-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>CeO$_2$-ZnO materials were prepared by amorphous citrate process and characterized by TGA, XRD, UV-DRS and surface area measurements. TGA showed that the citrate precursors decompose in the range 350-550$^\circ $C producing CeO$_2$-containing catalytic materials. XRD and DRS results indicated the formation of well-dispersed interstitial Zn$_x$Ce$^{4+}_{1-2x}$Ce$^{3+}_{2x}$O$_2$ solid solution on ZnO matrix. Addition of CeO$_2$ to ZnO produced high surface area mixed oxide materials in citrate method. Cyclohexanol conversion reaction was carried out on these catalytic materials to investigate the effect of rare earth oxide on the activity and selectivity. It was found that CeO$_2$ promotes the activity of ZnO without affecting the selectivity to cyclohexanone significantly. The factors such as reaction temperature and WHSV have turned out to be important for cyclohexanol conversion over CeO$_2$-containing ZnO catalyst materials.</p>

				<title>Carbonaceous alumina films deposited by MOCVD from aluminium acetylacetonate: a spectroscopic ellipsometry study</title>
				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0163-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to characterize carbonaceous, crystalline aluminium oxide films grown on Si(100) by low-pressure metal organic chemical vapour deposition, using aluminium acetylacetonate as the precursor. The presence of carbon in the films, attribured to the use of a metalorganic precursor for the deposition of films, was identified and analysed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron sectroscopy, for the elemental distribution and the chemical nature of the carbon in the films, respectively. Ellipsometry measurments over the photon energy range 1$\cdot$5-5 eV were used to derive the pseudo-dielectric function of the aluminium oxide-containing films. Multi-layer modelling using linear regression techniques and the effective medium approximation were carried out to extract the structural details of the specimens. The excellent fit between the simulated and experimental optical data validates the empirical model for alumina-containing coatings grown by MOCVD.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with development of single- and double-layer microwave absorbing paints using Mn-substituted barium hexagonal ferrite. The comparative studies of both theoretical and experimental results at Ku band have been reported. It has been found that the single layer absorbing paint exhibits peak absorption of 12$\cdot$3 dB at 17$\cdot$4 GHz for a thickness of 1$\cdot$12 mm. Double layer absorbing paint with each layer of different composition of ferrite gives a broad band characteristics, but at the cost of lowered absorption.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sinterable nano silicon carbide powders of mean particle size (37 nm) were prepared by attrition milling and chemical processing of an acheson type alpha silicon carbide having mean particle size of 0$\cdot$39 $\mu$m (390 nm). Pressureless sintering of these powders was achieved by addition of boron carbide of 0$\cdot$5 wt% together with carbon of 1 wt% at 2050$^\circ $C at vacuum (3 mbar) for 15 min. Nearly 99% sintered density was obtained. The mechanism of sintering was studied by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. This study shows that the mechanism is a solid-state sintering process. Polytype transformation from 6H to 4H was observed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The low thermal expansion ceramic system, Ca$_{1–x}$Sr$_x$Zr$_4$P$_6$O$_{24}$, for the compositions with $x$ = 0, 0$\cdot$25, 0$\cdot$50, 0$\cdot$75 and 1 was synthesized by solid-state reaction. The sintering characteristics were ascertained by bulk density measurements. The fracture surface microstructure examined by scanning electron microscopy showed the average grain size of 2$\cdot$47 $^\mu$m for all the compositions. The thermal expansion data for these ceramic systems over the temperature range 25–800$^\circ $C is reported. The sinterability of various solid solutions and the hysteresis in dilatometric behaviour are shown to be related to the crystallographic thermal expansion anisotropy. A steady increase in the amount of porosity and critical grain size with increase in $x$ is suggested to explain the observed decrease in the hysteresis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Proton conducting composites of heteropolyacid hydrates (phosphomolybdic acid H$_3$PMo$_{12}$O$_{40}$⋅$n$H$_2$O,PMA; phosphotungstic acid H$_3$PW$_{12}$O$_{40}$⋅$n$H$_2$O, PTA) and salt hydrate like NiCl$_2$⋅6H$_2$O were prepared with insulating Al$_2$O$_3$ as dispersoid. The ionic conductivity peaks at two concentrations of Al$_2$O$_3$ indicating two percolation thresholds for proton conduction. Two separate experiments were carried out to check the existence of such percolation thresholds viz. the volta battery experiment involving the measurement of e.m.f. of an electrochemical cell with composites of different compositions used as electrolyte and the composition vs conductivity measured by the complex impedance spectroscopy. The presence of two maxima has been attributed to two different percolation thresholds for the two possible mobile protonic species $H^+$ (H$_3$O$^+$) and OH$^–$ arising from the hydrates.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Under the condition of tungsten inert gas shielded welding (TIG) + shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) technology, the microstructure in the welding zone of 9Cr–1Mo–V–Nb (P91) heat-resisting steel is studied by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The test results indicate that when the weld heat input ($E$) of TIG is 8$\cdot$5 $\sim$ 11$\cdot$7 kJ/cm and the weld heat input of SMAW is 13$\cdot$3 $\sim$ 21$\cdot$0 kJ/cm, the microstructure in the weld metal is composed of austenite and a little amount of $\delta$ ferrite. The substructure of austenite is crypto–crystal martensite, which included angle. There are some spot precipitates in the martensite base. TEM analysis indicates that the fine structure in the heat-affected zone is lath martensite. There are some carbides (lattice constant, 1$\cdot$064 nm) at the boundary of grain as well as inside the grain, most of which are Cr$_{23}$C$_6$ and a little amount of (Fe, Me)$_{23}$C$_6$.</p>

					<p>The present paper describes the alcohol sensing characteristics of spin coated SnO$_2$ thin film deposited by using sol–gel process. The sensitivity of the film was measured at different temperatures and different concentrations of alcohol at ppm level. Alcohol detection result shows peak sensitivity at 623 K. The variation of sensitivity and ethanol concentration has shown a linear relationship up to 1150 ppm and after that it saturates. The response time measurement of the sensor was also observed and it was found that the response time is 30 sec. The results obtained favour the sol–gel process as a low cost method for the preparation of thin films with a high sensing characteristic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of different compositions of monomers on the transport properties of copolymers by various techniques such as optical, electrical and magnetic has been investigated and compared with the homopolymers. The UV-visible absorption spectra show a hypsochromic shift with an increase in the o-anisidine content in copolymers indicating a decrease in the extent for conjugation (i.e. an increase in the bandgap). From temperature dependence of electrical conductivity the transport parameters such as charge localization length and average hopping distance are calculated and also the effect of the monomeric composition on the coherence length has been discussed. The magnetic studies show the paramagnetic and diamagnetic nature of homopolymers and copolymers. The X-ray diffraction pattern indicates that the copolymers are of amorphous nature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of twin pellets of Se$_{80}$Te$_{20–x}$In$_x$ ($x$ = 2, 4, 6 and 10) glasses, prepared under a load of 5 tons were carried out at room temperature using transient plane source (TPS) technique. The measured values of both thermal conductivity and diffusivity were used to determine the specific heat per unit volume of the said materials in the composition range of investigation. Results indicated that both the values of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increased with the addition of indium at the cost of tellurium whereas the specific heat remained almost constant. This compositional dependence behaviour of the thermal conductivity and diffusivity has been explained in terms of the iono-covalent type of bond which In makes with Se as it is incorporated in the Se–Te glass.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>$I–z$ spectroscopy measurements using a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) were carried out to determine the change in the work function of a W tip following one monolayer (1 ML) deposition of Ni and subsequent annealing at 700 K. The variation in the actual gap voltage obtained from the $I–z$ data of the clean tip was used in the calculation. The estimated values of the change in work function, 0$\cdot$16 eV and 0$\cdot$59 eV, for as-deposited and annealed tips, respectively match closely with the reported values. The method is generally applicable to chemically modified metal tips.</p>

				<feature>Experimental Techniques</feature>
				<page>0251-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive analysis of size and strain broadened profile shapes in X-ray diffraction line broadening analysis is presented. Both size and strain broadened profiles were assumed to be Voigtian and the derived microstructural parameters (size and strain) were found to be in close agreement with those calculated from model independent Warren–Averbach method. The method is applied to three different alumina samples viz. micron size $\alpha$-alumina ($\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$) prepared by the combustion of aluminium nitrate and urea mixture, annealed samples and commercial $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ sample. It is likely from the present analysis that a significant Gaussian size contribution is related to narrow size distribution observed from the analysis. It has been concluded that present Voigtian analysis is more reliable and may largely replace the earlier simplified integral breadth methods of analysis often used in line broadening analysis.</p>

				<page>0263-0266</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ni–Zn ferrite powders were synthesized by self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) method. X-ray diffraction, TEM and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) were used to characterize the phase composition, microstructure and magnetic properties of the combustion products. The effect of the combustion temperature ($T_c$), the major parameter of the SHS process, on particle size, phase composition and magnetic properties of the products was also studied. The results showed that particle size grew with the increasing combustion temperature. The maximum saturation magnetization, $M_s$, increased with combustion temperature indicating the growth of grain size and high degree of ferritization, while residual magnetization, $M_r$, and coercive force, $H_c$, decreased. Compared with other methods, Ni$_{0\cdot35}$Zn$_{0\cdot65}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ ferrite powders with improved magnetic properties can be obtained by SHS at 1000$^\circ $C.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>TiO$_2$ is produced and marketed in two main grades viz. anatase and rutile. Both anatase and rutile have their own pigmentry properties and hence cannot be substituted by each other. Pure anatase on heating at higher temperatures undergoes crystallographic rearrangement to form rutile. This transformation in presence of NiO and Fe$_2$O$_3$ under air atmosphere was studied using XRD and SEM. The transformation temperature was found to be reduced much in presence of NiO and Fe$_2$O$_3$ and the extent of lowering was higher for NiO than Fe$_2$O$_3$. The activation energy for this transformation was also calculated. The method of preparation had major influence on the transformation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The room temperature structure of three compounds belonging to the Aurivillius family ($n =$ 4), ABi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ (A = Ba, Sr or Pb) has been analysed. BaBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ crystallizes in a tetragonal $I4/mmm$ space group whereas SrBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ and PbBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ crystallize in the orthorhombic space group $A2_1am$. The starting model for the Sr and Pb analogues was derived from $ab\ initio$ methods and refined using the Rietveld method. The cations Ba and Sr are disordered over the Bi sites while the Pb cation is found exclusively in the [Bi$_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ layers. The TiO$_6$ octahedra are tilted with the Ti–O bonds forming zigzag chains along the $‘c’$ axis. The displacement of Bi atoms along the $‘a’$ axis might be responsible for ferroelectricity in these compounds. The high temperature X-ray data above $T_c$ indicate no structural transition for A = Ba and Pb while A = Sr transforms to the tetragonal structure.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrotalcite like precursors containing Pd$^{II}$–Mg$^{II}$–Al$^{III}$ with varying molar ratios, (Pd + Mg)/Al $\approx$ 3 and Mg/Pd $\approx$ 750 to 35, were prepared by coprecipitation of metal nitrates at constant pH. Characterization of samples as synthesized and their calcined products by elemental analyses, powder XRD, TG–DTA, FT–IR spectroscopy, TPR and N$_2$ physisorption indicated a well crystalline hydrotalcite like structure with incorporation of Pd$^{2+}$ in the brucite layers. Thermal decomposition of hydrotalcite precursors at intermediate temperatures led to amorphous mixed oxides, Pd/MgAl(O), which on reduction yielded bi-functional catalyst, Pd$^\circ $/MgAl(O). The resultant catalysts with acid, base and hydrogenating sites, were highly active and selective for one-step synthesis of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) from acetone and hydrogen. The results showed an optimal balance between acid-base and metallic sites were required to increase the selectivity of MIBK and stability of the catalysts.</p>

				<title>Metadynamic recrystallization in C steels</title>

				<page>0291-0299</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metadynamic recrystallization has been investigated in three plain carbon steels (ENIA, EN2 and EN24) through the use of hot interrupted compression tests on a wedge plastometer. Holding time was 0$\cdot$5 s between passes. Strain rates of 0$\cdot$05 and 0$\cdot$12/s and small strain increments of 3, 5 and 7% were employed. Test temperatures were varied between 800 and 1100$^\circ $C.</p>
					<p>Various incremental and continuous stress strain curves were highlighted at different temperatures and strain rates for 3 steels, ENIA, EN2 and EN24, resulting in varying flow stresses and strains. Highest peak stress was 180 MPa for EN24 at peak strain of 0$\cdot$25 and 900$^\circ $C, with a strain rate 0$\cdot$12/s. Peak strain values for all steels at 1100$^\circ $C was 0$\cdot$133 at a strain rate of 0$\cdot$05/s and 0$\cdot$15 at a strain rate of 0$\cdot$12/s.</p>
					<p>Strain accumulation resulted in dynamic and metadynamic recrystallization with refinement to about 15 $\mu$m for dynamic and 22 $\mu$m for metadynamic recrystallization. Fractional softening, $X$, decreased from 0$\cdot$27 to 0$\cdot$12 as recrystallization times in metadynamic recrystallization increased from 0$\cdot$9 s to 1$\cdot$5 s at 1100$^\circ $C. Time for 50% metadynamic recrystallization was also reduced as temperature increased.</p>
					<p>For ENIA, a drop from 10000 s to 20 s, as temperature increased from 800 to 1100$$^\circ $C was observed. For EN24 and EN2 steels, a drop from 4000 s to 6 s for similar temperature rise was observed.</p>
					<p>Metadynamic recrystallization (at strains higher than critical strain) is observed to be a strong function of strain rate and a very weak function of temperature and strain. It significantly refined the austenite grain size prior to transformation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A fatigue crack can be effectively retarded by heating a spot near the crack tip under nil remote stress condition. The subcritical spot heating at a proper position modifies the crack growth behaviour in a way, more or less, similar to specimen subjected to overload spike. It is observed that the extent of crack growth retardation increases with increasing level of overload as well as with increasing spot temperature. It is also observed that modification in crack growth behaviour is a function of location of heating spot and maximum retardation is observed at + 5 position.</p>

				<page>0315-0317</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed X-ray Fourier line shape analysis has been performed on three compositions of Al–Zn alloys viz. Al–3 55 wt% Zn, Al–14 7 wt% Zn and Al–19 3 wt% Zn in $fcc$ phase. It has been found that deformation stacking faults, both intrinsic $\alpha'$ and extrinsic $\alpha''$ are absent in the cold worked state and twin fault $\beta$ is found to be slightly present in the deformed lattice of the two initial compositions of the alloys. Similar to the effect of solute germanium and copper, respectively in Al–Ge and Al–Cu systems, hexagonal zinc also fails to impart faulting in $fcc$ Al–Zn system. This corroborates the fact that aluminium has high stacking fault energy.</p>

					<p>Charpy V-notch impact toughness of 600 MPa yield stress TMT rebars alloyed with copper, phosphorus, chromium and molybdenum has been evaluated. Subsize Charpy specimens were machined from the rebar keeping the tempered martensite rim intact. The copper–phosphorus rebar showed toughness of 35 J at room temperature. The toughness of copper–molybdenum and copper–chromium rebars was 52 J. The lower toughness of phosphorus steel is attributed to solid solution strengthening and segregation of phosphorus to grain boundaries. Due to superior corrosion resistance, copper–phosphorus TMT rebar is a candidate material in the construction sector.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Anomalous dispersion effects lead to the modification of the measured X-ray structure factors. In this work, we have determined the imaginary part of the anomalous dispersion correction terms ($f''$ ) of arsenide atom (As), through the X-ray data collected using spherical single crystal of GaAs, at various temperatures, i.e. 170, 200, 250 and 300 K. It is stressed that more measurements of $f''$ of the elements are needed to confirm the theoretical calculations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The site symmetry of P doped ZnSe is analysed in detail here, as the recent experiments suggest two possible symmetries $T_d$ and $C_{3V}$. The reduction to $C_{3V}$ is attributed to the presence of natural impurity, Ga. Our calculations based on molecular model and Green’s functions suggest that the symmetry $C_{3V}$ is possible with ZnSe : P when Jahn Teller distortion of about $\sim$ 0$\cdot$2 Å (towards one of Zn atom) is assumed. This has been supported by other experiments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polycrystalline Pb(Mn$_{0\cdot5}$W$_{0\cdot5}$)O$_3$, a ferroelectric oxide having perovskite structure, was prepared by high temperature solid state reaction technique. Preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis confirms single phase formation with the lattice parameters $a$ = 7$\cdot$2501 Å, $b$ = 8$\cdot$1276 Å and $c$ = 12$\cdot$0232 Å. Room temperature dielectric constant ($\varepsilon'$ ) and loss tangent (tan $\delta$) were scanned with respect to frequency in the range 100 Hz–1 MHz. Detailed study of dielectric constant and electrical conductivity reveals a phase change around 400 K, which is quite different from those in the other materials of the same type. Further, the seebeck coefficient ($\alpha$) is temperature independent. The conduction is interpreted as due to small polaron hopping.</p>

Far infrared absorption spectra show two significant absorption bands, first at about 600 cm$^{–1}$ and second at about 425 cm$^{–1}$ , which were respectively attributed to tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites of the spinel. The positions of bands are found to be composition dependent. The force constants, $K_T$ and $K_O$, were calculated and plotted against zinc concentration. Compositional dependence of force constants is explained on the basis of cation–oxygen bond distances of respective sites and cation distribution.</p>

					<p>In this study, austenite–martensite phase transformations which are formed by cooling effect in Fe–30% Ni–0$\cdot$2% Mn alloy are investigated with Mössbauer spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The single peak of the paramagnetic phase and the six peaks of the ferromagnetic phase of Fe–30% Ni–0$\cdot$2% Mn alloy were observed in the Mössbauer spectrum. The internal magnetic field strength of ferromagnetic martensite phase was determined as 33$\cdot$8 $T$ and the isomer shift values were determined as – 0$\cdot$11 mm⋅sec$^{–1}$ and – 0$\cdot$06 mm⋅sec$^{–1}$, respectively, for the austenite and martensite phases. In this alloy, athermal transformation was observed. The results obtained are in agreement with literature.</p>

				<title>TEM observation and fracture morphology in the CGHAZ of a new 0Cr18Mo2Ti ferritic stainless steel</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0361-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microstructure, precipitates and fracture morphology in the coarse grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) of a new high-purity 0Cr18Mo2Ti ferritic stainless steel were studied by means of optical metallography, SEM, TEM, X-ray diffractometer, etc. Experimental results indicated that grain coarsening resulted in brittle fracture in the CGHAZ of 0Cr18Mo2Ti steel. The reduction of impact toughness in the CGHAZ due to change of cooling rate can be attributed to the increase of nitrides (TiN, Cr$_2$N, etc). These nitrides in the CGHAZ promote initiation and propagation of brittle cracks. The precipitated Cr$_2$N nitrides in the grain boundaries decrease impact toughness in the CGHAZ of 0Cr18Mo2Ti steel by promoting crack initiation. In practical applications, the welding heat input ($E$) should be as low as possible to prevent toughness reduction in the CGHAZ.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The chemical composition of the second phase precipitation in the vacuum diffusion-bonded zone of Fe$_3$Al intermetallic compound and Q235 carbon steel was analysed by means of electron probe microanalyser (EPMA). The relative content of the second phase precipitation and grain size was evaluated through a micro-image analyser. The percentage of Fe and Al content in the diffusion zone was measured by EPMA. The results indicated that the relative content of the second phase precipitation rich in carbon and chromium at the Fe$_3$Al/Q235 interface was much higher. With the transition from Fe$_3$Al intermetallic compound to Q235 carbon steel across Fe$_3$Al/Q235 interface, the grain diameter decreased from 250 $\mu$m to 112 $\mu$m, Al atom content decreased from 27% to 15%, while Fe atom content increased from 76% to 96%.</p>

				<title>Significance and influence of the ambient temperature as a rate factor of steel reinforcement corrosion</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0375-0379</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rate of corrosion of reinforcement being an electrochemical process, undoubtedly is dependent even on the level of the ambient temperature. Therefore, the ambient temperature seems to be an important factor of the corrosion rate and the durability of the reinforced concrete structures in aggressive environment.</p>
					<p>The present data on the influence and significance of the ambient temperature in the process of corrosion of reinforcement of the reinforced structures are surprisingly limited and poor. It seems that it is supposed to be a simple increase of corrosion rate when the ambient temperature is increased.</p>
					<p>The lack of information was a motivation for the present study. It was aimed at the experimental research of the influence of the increase of the ambient temperature on the rate of chloride induced corrosion of steel reinforcement. The results obtained show that the influence of the studied factor is more complex showing an acceleration effect till a temperature of 40$^\circ $C diversified by the inhibition effects with further increase of the ambient temperature.</p>

					<p>A synthetic porous ceramic composite material consisting of the mullite, cordierite and cristobalite phases is produced from a mixture of paper pulp waste and clay by reaction sintering at 1400$^\circ $C. Physicomechanical properties such as bulk density, porosity, cold crushing strength and cold modulus of rupture have been studied. The presence of mullite, cordierite, cristobalite and quartz as major phases and montellecite, tatanite, forsterite and anorthite as minor phases have been confirmed by X-ray diffraction pattern. SEM studies revealed the presence of well developed needle shaped mullite and quartz crystals. The paper also discusses the possible uses of this type of porous composite material.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Four compositions of nitride bonded SiC were fabricated with varying particle size of SiC of $\sim$ 9$\cdot$67, $\sim$ 13$\cdot$79, $\sim$ 60 $\mu$ and their mixture with Si of $\sim$ 4$\cdot$83 $\mu$ particle size. The green density and hence the open porosity of the shapes were varied between 1$\cdot$83 to 2$\cdot$09 g/cc and 33$\cdot$3 to 26$\cdot$8 vol.%, respectively. The effect of these parameters on room temperature and high temperature strength of the composite up to 1300$^\circ $C in ambient condition were studied. The high temperature flexural strength of the composite of all compositions increased at 1200 and 1300$^\circ $C because of oxidation of Si$_3$N$_4$ phase and blunting crack front. Formation of Si$_3$N$_4$ whisker was also observed. The strength of the mixture composition was maximum.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Equilibrium concentrations of various condensed and gaseous phases have been thermodynamically calculated, using the free energy minimization criterion, for the metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) of copper films using $bis$(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptadionato)copper(II) as the precursor material. From among the many chemical species that may possibly result from the CVD process, only those expected on the basis of mass spectrometric analysis and chemical reasoning to be present at equilibrium, under different CVD conditions, are used in the thermodynamic calculations. The study predicts the deposition of pure, carbon-free copper in the inert atmosphere of argon as well as in the reactive hydrogen atmosphere, over a wide range of substrate temperatures and total reactor pressures. Thin films of copper, grown on SiO$_2$/Si(100) substrates from this metalorganic precursor by low pressure CVD have been characterized by XRD and AES. The experimentally determined composition of CVD-grown copper films is in reasonable agreement with that predicted by thermodynamic analysis.</p>

				<title>Deposition of silicon films in presence of nitrogen plasma$—$A feasibility study</title>
				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0399-0402</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A design, development and validation work of plasma based ‘activated reactive evaporation (ARE) system’ is implemented for the deposition of the silicon films in presence of nitrogen plasma on substrate maintained at room temperature. This plasma based deposition system involves evaporation of pure silicon by e-beam gun in presence of nitrogen plasma, excited by inductively coupled RF source (13$\cdot$56 MHz). The activated silicon reacts with the ionized nitrogen and the films get deposited on silicon substrate. Different physical and process related parameters are changed. The grown films are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ellipsometry. The results indicate that the film contains silicon nitride and a phase of silicon oxy nitride deposited even at room temperature. This shows the feasibility of using the ARE technique for the deposition of silicon films in nitrogen plasma.</p>

				<title>Ion-beam modifications of the surface morphology and conductivity in some polymer thin films</title>
				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0403-0406</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Studies on the surface micromorphology and surface conductivity in thin polymer films of poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly ethylene oxide (PEO) in both as-grown and ion-implanted polymer films have been carried out to reveal certain specific features of the ordered state in these materials. Optical microscopic investigations revealed the existence and enhanced formation in number of spherulites and dendrites in ionimplanted films relative to the as-grown films. The number and rate of formation of spherulites indicated an increase in the degree of crystallinity in these films. Measurements of surface conductivity of as-grown and ion-implanted polymer films, employing four-point probe method, indicated a decrease in electrical conductivity on ion-implantation. Photomicrographic analysis of the PVA and PEO thin film surfaces, has enabled to propose a temperature–stress induced mechanism of crystallization in conjunction with the surface conductivity measurements. The decrease in surface conductivity on ion-implantation in both PVA and PEO thin films, is attributed to a decrease in mobility of macromolecular charged species due to an increase in degree of crystallinity as has been observed by optical microscopy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The electrical properties of silver selenide thin films prepared by reactive evaporation have been studied. Samples show a polymorphic phase transition at a temperature of 403 $\pm$ 2 K. Hall effect study shows that it has a mobility of 2000 cm$^2$V$^{–1}$s$^{–1}$ and carrier concentration of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{–3}$ at room temperature. The carriers are of $n$-type. X-ray diffraction study indicates that the as-prepared films are polycrystalline in nature. The lattice parameters were found to be $a$ = 4$\cdot$353 Å, $b$ = 6$\cdot$929 Å and $c$ = 7$\cdot$805 Å.</p>

					<p>Crystal behaviours such as crystallization temperature (amorphous to tetragonal ($t$) zirconia), tendency of phase transformation (tetragonal to monoclinic ($m$) zirconia) and lattice strain were studied with mechanical property e.g. tensile strength of sol–gel derived ZrO$_2$–2 mol% RE$_2$O$_3$ (RE = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Dy) spun fibres. Rare earth cations of varying sizes played a significant role in changing the above mentioned properties of ZrO$_2$–2 mol% RE$_2$O$_3$ fibres. It was found that with decreasing the ionic size difference between the zirconium and RE ions, crystallization temperature (amorphous $\rightarrow \ t$-ZrO$_2$) decreased, the probability of phase transformation ($t \rightarrow m$) decreased, lattice strain which is related to lattice distortion decreased and tensile strength increased.</p>

				<title>Preliminary $in\ vitro$ and $in\ vivo$ characterizations of a sol–gel derived bioactive glass–ceramic system</title>
				<feature>Sol--gel Materials</feature>
				<page>0419-0429</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study investigates quantitatively and qualitatively the sol–gel derived bioactive glass–ceramic system (BGS)$—$apatite–wollastonite (AW) type granules in the size range of 0$\cdot$5–1 mm, as an effective graft material for bone augmentation and restoration. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the sintered granules revealed the rough material surface with micropores in the range 10–30 $\mu$m. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the granules revealed the presence of crystalline phases of the hydroxyapatite and wollastonite, and the functional groups of the silicate and phosphates were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The $in\ vitro$ cell culture studies with L929 mouse fibroblast cell line showed very few cells adhered on the BGS disc after 24 h. This could be due to the highly reactive surface of the disc concomitant with the crystallization but not due to the cytotoxicity of the material, since the cellular viability (MTT assay) with the material was 80%. Cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility studies proved that the material was non-toxic and biocompatible. After 12 weeks of implantation of the BGS granules in the tibia bone of New Zealand white rabbits, the granules were found to be well osteointegrated, as observed in the radiographs. Angiogram with barium sulphate and Indian ink after 12 weeks showed the presence of microcapillaries in the vicinity of the implant site implicating high vascularity. Gross observation of the implant site did not show any inflammation or necrosis. SEM of the implanted site after 24 weeks revealed good osteointegration of the material with the newly formed bone and host bone. New bone was also observed within the material, which was degrading. Histological evaluation of the bone healing with the BGS granules in the tibial defect at all time intervals was without inflammation or fibrous tissue encapsulation. After 2 weeks the new bone was observed as a trabeculae network around the granules, and by 6 weeks the defect was completely closed with immature woven bone. By 12 weeks mature woven bone was observed, and new immature woven bone was seen within the cracks of the granules. After 24 weeks the defect was completely healed with lamellar bone and the size of the granules decreased. Histomorphometrically the area percentage of new bone formed was 67$\cdot$77% after 12 weeks and 63$\cdot$37% after 24 weeks. Less bone formation after 24 weeks was due to an increased implant surface area contributed by the material degradation and active bone remodeling. The osteostimulative and osteoconductive potential of the BGS granules was established by tetracycline labelling of the mineralizing areas by 2 and 6 weeks. This sol–gel derived BGS granules proved to be bioactive and resorbable which in turn encouraged active bone formation.</p>

				<title>Development of a total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometer for ultra-trace element analysis</title>
				<feature>Instrumentation</feature>
				<page>0435-0441</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simple and fairly inexpensive total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectrometer has been designed, constructed and realized. The spectrometer is capable of ultra-trace multielement analysis as well as performs surface characterization of thin films. The TXRF setup comprises of an X-ray generator, a slitcollimator arrangement, a monochromator/cutoff-stage, a sample reflector stage and an X-ray detection system. The glancing angle of incidence on the two reflectors is implemented using a sine-bar mechanism that enables precise angle adjustments. An energy dispersive detector and a GM counter are employed for measuring respectively the fluorescence intensities and the direct X-ray beam intensity. A Cu-target X-ray generator with its line focus window is used as an excitation source. The spectrometer is quite portable with its compact design and use of a peltier cooled solid state detector for energy dispersive detection. Alignment and characterization of the TXRF system has been performed and the minimum detection limits for various elements have been determined to be in the range of 100 pg to 5 ng even at low X-ray generator powers of 30 kV, 5 mA. The capability of the TXRF system developed for thin film characterization is also demonstrated.</p>

					<p>Fly ash (FA) poses serious problems to the industries. Integrated steel plants generate huge quantity of FA from their captive power plants and other furnaces. This ash is generally disposed off in the ash ponds along with other sludges and residues of steel making operations. This changes the constitution of FA and makes the brick manufacturing difficult. This paper has attempted to devise the ways for the use of this mixed ash for manufacturing mixed ash clay bricks successfully. The bricks thus made are superior in structural and aesthetic qualities and portents huge saving in the manufacturing costs with better consumer response.</p>

					<p>Potentiometric sensors based on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with WO$_3$ as sensing electrode were fabricated using either Pt or Au electrodes. The sensors were studied in the temperature range 550–700$^\circ $C in the presence of different concentrations (300–1000 ppm) of NO$_2$ and CO in air. The response to NO$_2$ was very stable with fast response time (20–40 s). The best sensitivity (18$\cdot$8 mV/decade) using Pt electrodes was observed at 600$^\circ $C. At the same temperature a cross-sensitivity (– 15 mV/decade) to CO gas was also noticed. The response to CO was decreased (– 4 mV/decade) using Au electrode. The role played by WO$_3$  on the sensing electrode was discussed.</p>

					<p>The potential of ZrO$_2$ thin film as a high-$κ$ gate dielectric for scaled MOSFET devices has been studied. ZrO$_2$ has been deposited directly on a Si$_{0\cdot8}$Ge$_{0\cdot2}$  substrate by reactive RF magnetron sputtering. An equivalent oxide thickness of $\lt$ 20 Å with a leakage current of the order of 10$^{–4}$ A/cm$^2$ at 1 V has been obtained. Well-behaved capacitance–voltage characteristics with an interface state density of 2 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ cm$^{–2}$eV$^{–1}$ have been achieved. The deposited dielectric exhibits low charge trapping under constant current stressing.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, the fluorite-structured solid solutions with the general formula, (MF$_2$)$_{1–x}$(RF$_3$)$_x$ (M = Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb and R is a rare-earth element or Y), have been the subject of numerous experimental studies focussed on their superionic properties. The overall cubic crystal symmetry (space group $Fm3m$) is conserved up to $x \leq x_{max}$, where $x_{max}$ 0$\cdot$4–0$\cdot$5 depending on M and R. The zone centre phonons and phonon dispersion along three symmetry directions of the mixed superionic compound (BaF$_2$)$_{1–x}$(LaF$_3$)$_x$ have been investigated by applying de Launey angular force model for $x \leq x_{max}$. The calculated results are compared and explained with available experimental results.</p>

				<title>A novel method for sensing rotational speed, linear displacement and current using superconducting BPSCCO magnetic sensor</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0463-0467</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For many decades, magnetic sensors have been of great assistance to mankind in variety of functions that include simple compass based navigational systems to devices that monitor the invisible biological activities. In industries magnetic sensors are in great demand for control and measurement of linear and rotary position sensing etc, because of its non destructive and contact less way of detection. Consequently, newer, smarter and cheaper materials are continuously being explored to suit the varied needs of technological requirements. In the present communication, the characteristics of a magnetic sensor, based on the non linear electromagnetic response of the weak links present in the polycrystalline BPSCCO superconductor are reported. The second harmonic response of sintered superconducting BPSCCO pellet in an alternating magnetic field at 40 kHz and 77 K being a strong linear function of low d.c. magnetic field has been utilized for the development of highly sensitive magnetic field sensors. The noise limited resolution of the sensor is found to be 3$\cdot$16 $\times$ 10$^{–9}$ T/$\surd$Hz for $H_{a.c.}$ = 16 Oe and frequency 40 kHz. We further demonstrate that such HTSC based magnetic sensors are capable of sensing the rotational speed, small displacement and direct current with good resolution. The experimental methods and results obtained are discussed.</p>

				<title>Purification of cadmium up to 5N+ by vacuum distillation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0479-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cadmium was refined by vacuum distillation, a technique suitable for low boiling and melting point materials, to remove the heavy and low vapour pressure impurities at ppm level. The detailed analysis of the purified Cd as well as raw Cd was done by ICP–OES techniques for 27 impurity elements. Purification was carried out in an efficient high-yield vacuum distillation system designed and fabricated for purifying 3N+ purity indigenous cadmium to 5N+ (99$\cdot$999%). Analysis confirmed the reduction of total impurity content from 134 ppm (3N7) for raw Cd to 3 ppm (5N7) upon vacuum distilled Cd. The present study shows that the analysis of impurities such as Fe, Mg and Ca are contributed from environmental effect, whereas impurities such as Pb, Bi, Ag, Ni, Cu, Zn and Tl require adaptation of elemental analysing technique to counter dilution effect. The Hg trace analysis can however be carried out by hydride generation techniques.</p>

				<title>Development of diamond coated tool and its performance in machining Al–11%Si alloy</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0487-0491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An attempt has been made to deposit CVD diamond coating on conventional carbide tool using hot filament CVD process. ISO grade K10 turning inserts with SPGN 120308 geometry were used to deposit diamond coating. This diamond coating well covering the rake surface, cutting edges and flank surfaces could be successfully deposited. The coatings were characterized by SEM, XRD and Raman spectroscopy for coating quality, morphology etc. Performance of diamond coated tool relative to that of uncoated carbide tool was evaluated in turning Al–11%Si alloy under dry environment. The diamond coated tool outperformed the uncoated carbide tool which severely suffered from sizeable built-up edge formation leading not only to escalation of cutting forces but also poorer surface finish. In contrast, the diamond coated tool, owing to chemical inertness of diamond coating towards the work material, did not show any trace of edge built-up even in dry environment and could maintain low level of cutting forces and remarkably improved surface finish. It has been further revealed that success of the diamond coated tool depends primarily on adhesion of the diamond coating with the carbide substrate and this is strongly influenced by the pre-treatment of the carbide substrate surface before coating.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0493-0495</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A sol–gel vacuum infiltration technique has been developed for the fabrication of near-net-shape ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) using discontinuous mullite fibre preform with 15 vol.% of fibre content and ZrO$_2$⋅10 wt.% Y$_2$O$_3$ sol as the infiltrant. Effect of sol viscosity, number of infiltration and calcination temperature on physico-mechanical properties of fabricated CMCs were examined. Characterization of the fibre preform, matrix material (in the form of ceramic specimen without fibre) and the developed CMCs were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD indicated the presence of cubic ($c$) and tetragonal ($t$) zirconia in both the CMCs and the ceramic specimens calcined even at 1400$^\circ $C. Flexural strength of the CMCs and the ceramic specimens (calcined at 1400$^\circ $C), determined by the three-point bending test, was found to be about 14 mPa and 1$\cdot$40 mPa, respectively. SEM indicated multiple fracture of the matrix which gave rise to pseudo elasticity. This is also evident from the load-displacement curve of the three-point bend test. SEM studies also indicated fibre pull-out in the fracture surface of the CMCs.</p>

				<title>Bi-layer functionally gradient thick film semiconducting methane sensors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0497-0499</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gas sensors based on metal oxide semiconductors like tin dioxide are widely used for the detection of toxic and combustible gases like carbon monoxide, methane and LPG. One of the problems of such sensors is their lack of sensitivity, which to some extent, can be circumvented by using different catalysts. However, highly reactive volatile organic compounds (VOC) coming from different industrial and domestic products (e.g. paints, lacquers, varnishes etc) can play havoc on such sensors and can give rise to false alarms. Any attempt to adsorb such VOCs (e.g. by using activated charcoal) results in sorption of the detecting gases (e.g. methane) too. To get round the problem, bi-layer sensors have been developed. Such tin oxide based functionally gradient bi-layer sensors have different compositions at the top and bottom layers. Here, instead of adsorbing the VOCs, they are allowed to interact and are consumed on the top layer of the sensors and a combustible gas like methane being less reactive, penetrates the top layer and interacts with the bottom layer. By modifying the chemical compositions of the top and bottom layers and by designing the electrode-lead wire arrangement properly, the top layer can be kept electrically shunted from the bottom layer and the electrical signal generated at the bottom layer from the combustible gas is collected. Such functionally gradient sensors, being very reliable, can find applications in domestic, industrial and strategic sectors.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Indium tin oxide (ITO) nano powders of different compositions (In : Sn = 90 : 10, 70 : 30 and 50 : 50) were prepared by heat treatment (300–450$^\circ $C) of mixed hydroxides of In(III) and Sn(IV). The hydroxides were obtained by the reaction of aq. NH$_3$ with mixed aq. solutions of In(NO$_3$)$_3$ and SnCl$_4$. FTIR and TG/DTA studies revealed that powders existed as In(OH)$_3$ H$_2$O−SnO$_3$H$_2$ H$_2$O in the solid state and then they transformed to In$_2$O$_3$–SnO$_2$ via some metastable intermediates after 300$^\circ $C. Cubic phase of In$_2$O$_3$ was identified by XRD for the oxides up to 30% of Sn. Particle size measurements of the solid dispersed in acetone and SEM study for microstructure showed that the oxides were in the nano range (55–75 nm) whereas the size range determined from Debye–Scherrer equation were 11–24 nm.</p>

				<title>Improved zinc oxide film for gas sensor applications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0513-0515</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a versatile material for different commercial applications such as transparent electrodes, piezoelectric devices, varistors, SAW devices etc because of its high piezoelectric coupling, greater stability of its hexagonal phase and its pyroelectric property. In fact, ZnO is a potential material for gas sensor applications. Good quality ZnO films were deposited on glass and quartz substrates by a novel CVD technique using zinc acetate as the starting solution. X-ray diffraction confirmed the crystallinity of the zinc oxide film and SEM study revealed uniform deposition of fine grains. Undoped ZnO films were used for detection of dimethylamine (DMA) and H$_2$ at different temperatures by recording the change in resistivity of the film in presence of the test gases. The response was faster and the sensitivity was higher compared to the earlier reported ZnO based sensors developed in our laboratory. The main objective of this work was to study the selectivity of the ZnO film for a particular gas in presence of the others. The operating temperature was found to play a key role in the selectivity of such sensors.</p>

				<title>Thermal sensor properties of PANI(EB)–CSA$_X$ ($X$ = 0$\cdot$4 $\pm$ 0$\cdot$1 mol) polymer thin films</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0521-0526</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Films of polyaniline(EB) doped with camphor sulfonic acid (CSA) from $m$-cresol on glass substrates exhibit considerable metallic properties. Such polymer metallic films have thermal sensitivity superior to ceramic metal (Cermet) films, prepared by metallo organic deposition (MOD) technique on silicon substrates. These PANI(EB)–CSA$_X$ ($X$ = 0$\cdot$5, 0$\cdot$4, 0$\cdot$3 mol) polymer films were developed through controlled temperature atmosphere 60 $\pm$ 2$^\circ $C for 60 min, and with the help of temperature dependence of resistivity ($\rho$) values, high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) i.e. $\alpha$ values, and figure of merit ($\rho \alpha$) values of these films, thermal sensitivity were compared from that we observed. Among the three doping ratios the PANI(EB)–CSA$_{0\cdot3 mol}$ film (4$\cdot$4 $\mu$m thick) on glass substrate resistivity ($\rho$) values in the range of 838–1699 $\Omega$⋅$\mu$m with high TCR i.e. $\alpha$ = 10,291 ppm/$^\circ $C and figure of merit ($\rho \alpha$) value in range of 8$\cdot$62–17$\cdot$48 $\Omega$m/$^\circ $C seems to be the best. This paper deals with these superior thermal-sensing properties together with optical studies and surface topography by atomic force microscopy (AFM). These polymer films offer design advantages in developing ‘thin film polymer thermal sensor’.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0541-0543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most of the semiconductor materials are diamagnetic by nature and therefore cannot take active part in the operation of the magneto electronic devices. In order to enable them to be useful for such devices a recent effort has been made to develop diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) in which small quantity of magnetic ion is introduced into normal semiconductors. The first known such DMS are II–VI and III–V semiconductors diluted with magnetic ions like Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, etc. Most of these DMS exhibit very high electron and hole mobility and thus useful for high speed electronic devices. The recent DMS materials reported are (CdMn)Te, (GaMn)As, (GaMn)Sb, ZnMn(or Co)O, TiMn(or Co)O etc. They have been produced as thin films by MBE and other methods. This paper will discuss the details of the growth and properties of the DMS materials and some of their applications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Many semiconductor integrated circuit manufacturing processes require high dose of implantation at very low energies. Conventional beam line ion implantation system suffers from low beam current at low energies, therefore, cannot be used economically for high dose applications. Plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) is emerging as a potential technique for such implantations. This method offers high dose rate irrespective of implantation energy. In the present study nitrogen ions were implanted using PIII in order to modify the properties of silicon and some refractory metal films. Oxidation behaviour of silicon was observed for different implantation doses. Diffusion barrier properties of refractory barrier metals were studied for copper metallization.</p>

					<p>Precursor sol for sol–gel silica layer was prepared from the starting material, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). The sol was deposited onto borosilicate crown (BSC) glass by the spinning technique (rpm 2500). The gel layer thus formed transformed to oxide layer on heating to 450$^\circ $C for $\sim$ 30 min. The physical thicknessand the refractive index of the layer were measured ellipsometrically (Rudolph Auto EL II) at 632$\cdot$8 nm. About 10 $\times$ 10 mm surface area of the silica layer was chosen for evaluation of thickness and refractive index values at different points (121 nos.) with 1 mm gap between two points. Those data were utilized in the Autolisp programme for 3-D mapping. Radial distribution of the evaluated values was also displayed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Gelcasting is a promising technique for shape forming of bulk dense or porous ceramic, metal structures. The process offers a number of advantages over processes such as slip casting, injection molding in forming complex ceramic shapes. It is shown here that the optimization of slurry rheology, choice of mold material, mold design and the drying conditions have a significant role in the overall success of the process. In this process, components of simple or complex shapes can be produced to near net shape by direct casting. If required complex shapes can also be produced by machining the green gelcast bodies. The process of gelcasting also has a lot of potential in forming highly porous ceramic shapes.</p>

				<page>0573-0575</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>FeNbCuSiB based materials were produced in the form of ribbons by rapid solidification techniques. The crystallization, magnetic, mechanical and corrosion behaviour were studied for the prepared materials as a function of quenching rate from liquid to the solid state. Higher quench rates produced a more amorphous structure exhibiting superior soft magnetic properties with improved corrosion resistance.</p>

				<title>Silver and gold nanocluster catalyzed reduction of methylene blue by arsine in micellar medium</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0577-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Arsenic can be determined in parts-per-million (ppm) level by absorbance measurement. This method is based on the quantitative colour bleaching of the dye, methylene blue by arsine catalyzed by nanoparticles in micellar medium. The arsine has been generated in situ from sodium arsenate by NaBH$_4$ reduction. The absorbance measurement was carried out at the $\lambda{max}$ of the dye at 660 nm. The calibration graph set-up for three linear dynamic ranges (LDR) are 0–8$\cdot$63 ppm, 0–1$\cdot$11 ppm and 0–0$\cdot$11 ppm and limit of detections (LODs) are 1$\cdot$3, 0$\cdot$53 and 0$\cdot$03 ppm, respectively. This method is simple, sensitive and easy to carry out. It is free from phosphate and silicate interference and applicable to real sample analysis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated Bi$_2$O$_3$–Eu$_2$O$_3$ binary system by doping with Eu$_2$O$_3$ in the composition range from 1 to 10 mole% via solid state reactions and succeeded to stabilize $\beta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ phase which is metastable when pure. Stability of $\beta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ polymorph was influenced by heat treatment temperature. Tetragonal type solid solution was obtained in 3–6 mole% addition range when annealed at 750$^\circ $C and the range was 2–7 mole% when annealed at 800$^\circ $C. We have also carried out investigations on lattice parameters, microstructural properties and elemental compositions of this $\beta$ type solid solution for each doping ratio. Lattice parameters increased with amount of Eu$_2$O$_3$ addition. Our experimental observations strongly suggested that oxygen deficiency type non-stoichiometry is present in doped $\beta$ type solid solutions.</p>

				<title>Formation of oxygen related donors in step-annealed CZ–silicon</title>
				<feature>Semiconductors</feature>
				<page>0589-0592</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of step-annealing necessitated by the difficulties being faced in the long duration annealing treatments to be given to CZ–silicon has been studied. One pre-anneal of 10 h followed by annealing of 10 h causes a decrease in the absorption coefficient for carbon ($\alpha_c$). Oxygen and carbon both accelerate thermal donor (TD) formation process but oxygen plays a dominating role. Three anneals of 10 h each followed by one anneal of 10 h support the view that carbon suppresses the donor formation. The absorption coefficient for carbon decreases after a few number of step-anneals resulting in the transformation of TD to new donor (ND) as brought about by annealing at temperature, $\gt$ 500$^\circ $C. It is quite logical to conclude that step-annealing may bring about the same results as obtained on continuous annealing for a longer duration.</p>
					<p>The results have been fully supported by proper interpretation in the light of existing theories.</p>

				<title>Preparation of Si$_3$N$_4$–SiC composites by microwave route</title>
				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0593-0598</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Si$_3$N$_4$–SiC composites have been microwave sintered using $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ and $\beta$-SiC as starting materials. Si$_3$N$_4$ rich compositions (95 and 90 vol.% Si$_3$N$_4$) have been sintered above 96% of theoretical density without using any sintering additives in 40 min. A monotonic decrease in relative density is observed with increase in SiC proportion in the composite. Decrease in relative density has manifested in the reduction of fracture toughness and microhardness values of the composite with increase in SiC content although the good sintering of matrix Si$_3$N$_4$ limits the decrease of fracture toughness. Highest value of fracture toughness of 6$\cdot$1 MPa m$^{1/2}$ is observed in 10 vol.% SiC composite. Crack propagation appears to be transgranular in the Si$_3$N$_4$ matrix and the toughening of the composites is through crack deflection around hard SiC particles in addition to its debonding from the matrix.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of a.c. conductivity of rubber ferrite composites from dielectric measurements</title>
				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0599-0607</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of frequency, composition and temperature on the a.c. electrical conductivity were studied for the ceramic, Ni$_{1–x}$Zn$_x$Fe$_2$O$_4$, as well as the filler (Ni$_{1–x}$Zn$_x$Fe$_2$O$_4$) incorporated rubber ferrite composites (RFCs). Ni$_{1–x}$Zn$_x$Fe$_2$O$_4$ (where $x$ varies from 0 to 1 in steps of 0$\cdot$2) were prepared by usual ceramic techniques. They were then incorporated into a butyl rubber matrix according to a specific recipe. The a.c. electrical conductivity ($\sigma_{a.c.}$) calculations were carried out by using the data available from dielectric measurements and by employing a simple relationship. The a.c. conductivity values were found to be of the order of 10$^{–3}$ S/m. Analysis of the results shows that $\sigma_{a.c.}$ increases with increase of frequency and the change is same for both ceramic Ni$_{1–x}$Zn$_x$Fe$_2$O$_4$ and RFCs. $\sigma_{a.c.}$ increases initially with the increase of zinc content and then decreases with increase of zinc. Same behaviour is observed for RFCs too. The dependence of $\sigma{a.c.}$ on the volume fraction of the magnetic filler was also studied and it was found that the a.c. conductivity of RFCs increases with increase of volume fraction of the magnetic filler. Temperature dependence of conductivity was studied for both ceramic and rubber ferrite composites. Conductivity shows a linear dependence with temperature in the case of ceramic samples.</p>

				<title>Metal oxalate complexes as novel inorganic dopants: Studies on their effect on conducting polyaniline</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Doped polyaniline materials with metal oxalate complexes of Cr, Fe, Mn, Co and Al were synthesized by $in\ situ$ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline using potassium perdisulphate as oxidant in aqueous sulphuric acid medium. These polymer materials were characterized by chemical analyses, spectral studies (UV-visible and IR), X-ray diffraction and thermal techniques and also by conductivity measurements by four-probe technique. The presence of complex anion in polyaniline material was confirmed by chemical and spectral analyses. The yield and conductivity of metal oxalate doped polyanilines were found to be high when compared to the simple sulphate ion doped polyaniline prepared under similar condition. UV-visible and IR spectral features not only confirmed the polyaniline doping by complex anions but also substantiated their facilitating effect on conductivity. The X-ray diffraction patterns indicated some crystalline nature in metal oxalate doped polyaniline and amorphous in polyaniline sulphate salt. The conductivity of the polymer samples strongly depended on the degree of crystallinity induced by complex counter anions as dopant. All the polymer materials, as evident from TGA curves, were observed to undergo three-step degradation of water loss, de-doping and decomposition of polymer. Further, the thermal stability of polyaniline was found to improve on doping with metal oxalate complex.</p>

				<page>0619-0633</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A direct laser fabrication technique (DLF) has been used to fabricate near net shape samples of a $gamma$-TiAl alloy using gas atomized Ti$_{48}$A1$_{48}$Mn$_2$Nb$_2$ alloy powder as a feed stock material. The microstructures of these Ti$_{48}$Al$_{48}$Mn$_2$Nb$_2$ laser treated samples have been characterized using optical, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), both immediately after laser fabrication and after heat treatments. The microstructural studies have shown that the microstructure is heterogeneous in nature and extremely fine in comparison with the conventionally processed material. The process parameters such as laser power and laser scanning speed greatly influence the morphology and the microstructure of the laser treated samples. Heat treatments for a number of process conditions have been carried out to examine the stability of the microstructure which remains stable up to 973 K and rapid grain coarsening occurs at 1273 K. A fully recrystallized and uniform microstructure is obtained after annealing at 1073 K for 24 h and compositional heterogeneity present in the laser-fabricated samples is eliminated. Annealing in the $\alpha$ phase field followed by air cooling and annealing in ($\alpha_2$ + $\gamma$) phase region gives rise to a homogeneous and uniform microstructure. However, the microstructure is much coarser than the microstructure of the DLF samples.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The fine structure in the Fe–Al alloy layer of a new hot dip aluminized steel (HDA) was examined by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD), electron diffraction technique, etc. The test results indicated that the Fe–Al alloy layer of the new aluminized steel mainly composed of Fe$_3$Al, FeAl and $\alpha$-Fe (Al) solid solution. There was no brittle phase containing higher aluminum content, such as FeAl$_3$ (59$\cdot$18% Al) and Fe$_2$Al$_7$ (62$\cdot$93% Al). The tiny cracks and embrittlement, formerly caused by these brittle phases in the conventional aluminum-coated steel, were effectively eliminated. There was no microscopic defect (such as tiny cracks, pores or loose layer) in the coating. This is favourable to resist high temperature oxidation and corrosion of the aluminized steel.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Single crystals of NaClO$_3$ and NaBrO$_3$ are grown from their aqueous solutions at a constant temperature of 35$^\circ $C by slow evaporation by using good quality seed crystals. Systematic microhardness studies are made on as-grown faces of these crystals at various loads. Typical cracks are observed at the corners of the impressions in NaClO$_3$ whereas in addition to the cracks at the corners microcracks also appeared in NaBrO$_3$ crystals around the impressions. The impressions formed in NaBrO$_3$ are not very clear as in NaClO$_3$, a possible mechanism for it is discussed. The work hardening index number ($n$) for both these crystals is around 1$\cdot$6 suggesting that these are moderately harder samples. The hardness studies point out that NaBrO3 is harder than NaClO$_3$ ($\Delta H \approx$ 100 kg/mm$^2$), this could be due to strong inter ionic forces acting between Na–Br in NaBrO$_3$ crystals. Using Gilman’s empirical relation, hardness values are calculated from the values of elastic constants ($C_{44}$) and are found to be close to the experimental results.</p>

				<title>Density functional theory and multiscale materials modeling</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0012</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the vital ingredients in the theoretical tools useful in materials modeling at all the length scales of interest is the concept of density. In the microscopic length scale, it is the electron density that has played a major role in providing a deeper understanding of chemical binding in atoms, molecules and solids. In the intermediate mesoscopic length scale, an appropriate picture of the equilibrium and dynamical processes has been obtained through the single particle number density of the constituent atoms or molecules. A wide class of problems involving nanomaterials, interfacial science and soft condensed matter has been addressed using the density based theoretical formalism as well as atomistic simulation in this regime. In the macroscopic length scale, however, matter is usually treated as a continuous medium and a description using local mass density, energy density and other related density functions has been found to be quite appropriate. A unique single unified theoretical framework that emerges through the density concept at these diverse length scales and is applicable to both quantum and classical systems is the so called density functional theory (DFT) which essentially provides a vehicle to project the many-particle picture to a single particle one. Thus, the central equation for quantum DFT is a one-particle Schrödinger-like Kohn–Sham equation, while the same for classical DFT consists of Boltzmann type distributions, both corresponding to a system of noninteracting particles in the field of a density-dependent effective potential. Selected illustrative applications of quantum DFT to microscopic modeling of intermolecular interaction and that of classical DFT to a mesoscopic modeling of soft condensed matter systems are presented.</p>

				<title>Realization of prediction of materials properties by $ab\ initio$ computer simulation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0013-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>$Ab\ initio$ treatment is becoming realistic to predict physical, chemical, and even mechanical properties of academically and industrially interesting materials. There is, however, some limitation in size and time of the system up to the order of several hundred atoms and $\sim$ 1 pico second, even if we use the fastest supercomputer efficiently. Therefore, it is very difficult to simulate realistic materials with grain boundaries and important reactions like diffusion in materials. To improve this situation, two ways have been invented. One way is to upgrade approximations to match the necessary levels according to inhomogeneous electron gas theory beyond the present day standard, i.e. local density approximation (LDA). The reason is simply that the system we are interested in is composed of many particles interacting with Coulomb forces governed by quantum mechanics. (Complete knowledge is available, and only what we should do is to make better approximations to explain the phenomena!). Another is to extract the necessary parameters from the $ab\ initio$ calculations on systems with limited number of atoms, and apply these results into cluster variation, direct, or any other sophisticated methods based on classical concepts such as statistical mechanics.</p>
					<p>In this paper, several typical examples recently worked out by our research group are introduced to indicate that these methodologies are actually possible to be successfully used to predict materials properties before experiments based on the present day state-of-art supercomputing systems. It includes scientific visualization of the results of $ab\ initio$ molecular dynamics simulation on atom insertion process to C$_{60}$ and to carbon nanotube, tight-binding calculation of single electron conductance properties in nanotube to create nano-scale diode virtually by computer, which will be a base of future nanoscale electric device in nanometer size, Li + H reaction without Born–Oppenheimer approximation, structural phase transitions in perovskite materials under very high pressure in earth by direct method, and prediction of wavelength of emitted light from Na clusters with GW (G = Green function-vertex, W = screened Coulomb interaction) approximation.</p>

					<p>By the example of $sp^3$-bonded semiconductors, we illustrate what 3rd-generation muffin–tin orbitals (MTOs) are. We demonstrate that they can be downfolded to smaller and smaller basis sets: $sp^3d^{10}, sp^3$, and bond orbitals. For isolated bands, it is possible to generate Wannier functions $a\ priori$. Also for bands, which overlap other bands, Wannier-like MTOs can be generated $a\ priori$. Hence, MTOs have a unique capability for providing chemical understanding.</p>

				<title>Tight-binding model for carbon from the third-generation LMTO method: A study of transferability</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The third-generation LMTO method provides a new wave function basis set in which the energy dependence of the interstitial region and inside muffin–tin (MT) spheres is treated on an equal footing. Within the improved method, basis functions in the interstitial are the screened spherical waves (SSWs) with boundary condition defined in terms of a set of ‘hard’ sphere radii $a_{RL}$. Energy eigenvalues obtained from the singleparticle Schrödinger equation for MT potential is energetically accurate and very useful for predicting a reliable first-principles tight-binding (TB) model of widely different systems. In this study, we investigate a possibility of the new basis sets transferability to different environment which could be crucial for TB applications to very large and complicated systems in realistic materials modelling. For the case of C where the issue of $sp^2$ vs $sp^3$ bonding description is primarily important, we have found that by downfolding the unwanted channels in the basis, the TB electronic structure calculations in both hexagonal graphite and diamond structures are well compared with those obtained from the full LDA schemes if we use the same choice of hard sphere radii, aRL and a fixed, arbitrary energy, $\varepsilon_{\nu}$. Moreover, the choice is robust and transferable to various situations, from different forms of graphite to a wide range of coordination. Using the obtained minimal basis set, we have been investigating the TB Hamiltonian and overlap matrices for different structure types for carbon, in particular we have predicted the on-site and hopping parameters ($\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \cdots, \gamma_6$) within an orthogonal representation for Slonczewski–Weiss–McClure (SWMcC) model of the Bernal structure. Our theoretical values are in excellent agreement with experimental ones from magnetoreflection measurements of Fermi surfaces for hexagonal graphite.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A brief introduction to the projector augmented wave method is given and recent developments are reviewed. The projector augmented wave method is an all-electron method for efficient $ab\ initio$ molecular dynamics simulations with full wave functions. It extends and combines the traditions of existing augmented wave methods and the pseudopotential approach. Without sacrificing efficiency, the PAW method avoids transferability problems of the pseudopotential approach and it has been valuable to predict properties that depend on the full wave functions.</p>

				<title>Environmentally dependent bond-order potentials: New developments and applications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0043-0051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The bond-order potentials (BOPs) idea employs the orthogonal two-centre tight-binding (TB) representation for the bond energy and the Harris–Foulkes approximation for the repulsive pairwise contribution. In the last ten years, although many efforts have been focused on theoretical calculations of the bond order expression, the BOPs still suffers from the uncertainty of how best to choose the semi-empirical TB parameters that enter the scheme. In this paper, we review recent developments to obtain the reliable and transferable BOPs which help to extend the accuracy and applicability to technologically important multicomponent systems. Firstly, we have found that a simple pair potential is unsuitable for describing the environmental screening effects due to the $s$ and $p$ orbital overlap repulsion in transition metal alloys and therefore the inability to reproduce the negative Cauchy pressures exhibiting in strong covalent systems. By adding the environmental dependent repulsive term, the Cauchy pressure problem has been removed and we are now able to get the BOPs for studying dislocations, extended defects and mechanical properties of hightemperature intermetallic Ti–Al alloys. In particular, new results on the core structures and possible dissociation of different type of dislocations will be discussed. Secondly, we present the first derivation of explicit analytic expressions for environmental dependence of $\sigma, \pi$ and $delta$ bond integrals by inverting the non-orthogonal matrix. We illustrate the power of this new formalism by showing that it not only captures the transferability of bond integrals between Mo, Si and MoSi$_2$ but also predicts the large discontinuities between first and second nearest neighbours for $pp\sigma, pp\pi$ and $dd\pi$ even though absence of any discontinuity for the $dd\sigma$ bond integral. A new environmentally dependent BOPs has been developed for $bcc$-Mo indicating that the core structure of 1/2$\langle$111$\rangle$ screw dislocations is narrower than structures found in previous studies in agreement with recent $ab\ initio$ calculations. Finally, the new formalism will allow us to study the problem of medium range order found recently in amorphous materials with covalent bonding at large and realistic nanoscale. For the case of $a$-C where the issue of $sp^2$ vs $sp^3$ is very crucial for modelling amorphous structure we found that the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bond integrals are not only transferable between graphite and diamond structures but they are also strongly anisotropic due to inter-plan bonding between graphite sheets.</p>

The computational treatment of the multitude of length and time scales involved in determining macroscopic properties has been attempted by several workers with varying degrees of success. This paper will review the recently developed quasicontinuum method which is an attempt to bridge the length scales in a single seamless model with the aid of the finite element method.

				<abstract>
					<p>Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) exhibit shell structures, very similar to atoms. Termed as ‘artificial atoms’ by some, they are much larger (1 100 nm) than real atoms. One can study a variety of manyelectron effects in them, which are otherwise difficult to observe in a real atom. We have treated these effects within the local density approximation (LDA) and the Harbola–Sahni (HS) scheme. HS is free of the selfinteraction error of the LDA. Our calculations have been performed in a three-dimensional quantum dot. We have carried out a study of the size and shape dependence of the level spacing. Scaling laws for the Hubbard ‘$U$’ are established.</p>

				<title>Obtaining Kohn–Sham potential without taking the functional derivative</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0069-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Over the past decade and a half, many new accurate density functionals, based on the generalized gradient approximation, have been proposed, and they give energies close to chemical accuracy. However, accuracy of the energy functional does not guarantee that its functional derivative, which gives the corresponding potential, is also accurate all over space. For example, although the Becke88 exchange–energy functional gives very good exchange energies, its functional derivative goes as $-\frac{1}{r^2}$ in comparison to the correct $-\frac{1}{r}$ for $r \rightarrow \infty$, where $r$ is the distance of the electron from a finite system. On the other hand, accuracy of the potential is of prime importance if one is interested in properties other than the total energy; properties such as optical response depend crucially on the potential in the outer regions of a system. In this paper we present a different approach, based on the ideas of Harbola and Sahni, to obtain the potential directly from the energy density of a given approximation, without taking recourse to the functional derivative route. This leads to a potential that is as accurate as the functional itself. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by presenting some results obtained from the Becke88 functional.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>As an aid towards improving the treatment of exchange and correlation effects in electronic structure calculations, it is desirable to have a clear picture of the errors introduced by currently popular approximate exchange–correlation functionals. We have performed $ab\ initio$ density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory calculations to investigate the thermal properties of bulk Cu, using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Thermal effects are treated within the quasiharmonic approximation. We find that the LDA and GGA errors for anharmonic quantities are an order of magnitude smaller than for harmonic quantities; we argue that this might be a general feature. We also obtain much closer agreement with experiment than earlier, more approximate calculations.</p>

				<title>Double stripe reconstruction of the Pt(111) surface</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0091-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the reconstruction of the Pt(111) surface theoretically, using a 2D generalization of the Frenkel–Kontorova model. The parameters in the model are obtained by performing $ab\ initio$ density functional theory calculations. The Pt(111) surface does not reconstruct under normal conditions but experiments have shown that there are two ways to induce the reconstruction: by increasing the temperature, or by depositing adatoms on the surface. The basic motif of this reconstruction is a ‘double stripe’ with an increased surface density and alternating $hcp$ and $fcc$ domains, arranged to form a honeycomb pattern with a very large  repeat distance of 100–300 Å. In this paper, we have studied the ‘double stripe’ reconstruction of the Pt(111) surface. In agreement with experiment, we find that it is favourable for the surface to reconstruct in the presence of adatoms, but not otherwise.</p>

				<title>Site preference of Zr in Ti$_3$Al and phase stability of Ti$_2$ZrAl</title>

				<page>0097-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The site preference of Zr atoms in Ti$_3$Al and the phase stability of Ti$_2$ZrAl are examined using first-principles electronic structure total energy calculations. Of the sixteen possible ways in which Ti, Zr and Al atoms can be arranged, in the lattice sites corresponding to $D0_{19}$ structure of Ti$_3$Al, to obtain Ti$_2$ZrAl, it is s hown that Zr atoms prefer to get substituted at the Ti sites. It is further shown that among the seven crystal structures considered, $D0_{19}$-like and $L1_2$-like are the competing ground-state structures of Ti$_2$ZrAl. The above results are in agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature. Calculated values of equilibrium lattice parameters, heat of formation and bulk modulus of Ti$_2$ZrAl are presented. The basis for the structural stability and bonding are analysed in terms of the density of states. Between the two possible $B$2-like structures, Ti$_2$ZrAl shows enhanced stability for the one where Zr is substituted in the Ti sublattice, which again is in agreement with the experimental observation.</p>

				<page>0109-0114</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We review recent findings of metal (M) encapsulated caged clusters of Si and Ge obtained from computer experiments based on an $ab\ initio$ pseudopotential method. It is shown that one M atom changes drastically the properties of Si and Ge clusters and that depending upon the size of the M atom, cages of 14, 15, and 16 Si as well as Ge atoms are formed. In particular M&#64;Si$_{16}$ silicon fullerene has been obtained for M = Zr and Hf, while a Frank–Kasper polyhedron has been obtained for M&#64;X$_{16}$, X = Si and Ge. These clusters show high stability and large highest occupied–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) gaps which are likely to make these species strongly abundant. A regular icosahedral M&#64;X$_{12}$ cluster has also been obtained for X = Ge and Sn by doping a divalent M atom. Interactions between clusters are rather weak. This is attractive for developing self-assembled cluster materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present results for ground state structures and properties of small hydrogenated silicon clusters using the Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics with simulated annealing. We discuss the nature of bonding of hydrogen in these clusters. We find that hydrogen can form a bridge like Si–H–Si bond connecting two silicon atoms. We find that in the case of a compact and closed silicon cluster hydrogen bonds to the silicon cluster from outside. To understand the structural evolutions and properties of silicon cluster due to hydrogenation, we have studied the cohesive energy and first excited electronic level gap of clusters as a function of hydrogenation. We find that first excited electronic level gap of Si$_n$ and Si$_n$H fluctuates as function of size and this may provide a first principle basis for the short-range potential fluctuations in hydrogenated amorphous silicon. The stability of hydrogenated silicon clusters is also discussed.</p>

					<p>The ground state structures and properties of Si$_3$H$_n$ (1 $\leq n \leq$ 6) clusters have been calculated using Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics with simulated annealing and steepest descent optimization methods. We have studied cohesive energy per particle and first excited electronic level gap of the clusters as a function of hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is done till all dangling bonds of silicon are saturated. Our results show that over coordination of hydrogen is favoured in Si$_3$H$_n$ clusters and the geometry of Si$_3$ cluster does not change due to hydrogenation. Cohesive energy per particle and first excited electronic level gap study of the clusters show that Si$_3$H$_6$ cluster is most stable and Si$_3$H$_3$ cluster is most unstable among the clusters considered here.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the application of biologically inspired genetic algorithms to determine the ground state structures of a number of Si–H clusters. The total energy of a given configuration of a cluster has been obtained by using a non-orthogonal tight-binding model and the energy minimization has been carried out by using genetic algorithms and their recent variant differential evolution. Our results for ground state structures and cohesive energies for Si–H clusters are in good agreement with the earlier work conducted using the simulated annealing technique. We find that the results obtained by genetic algorithms turn out to be comparable and often better than the results obtained by the simulated annealing technique.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Results of $ab\ initio$ electronic structure calculations on the compound, MgB$_2$, using the FPLAPW method employing GGA for the exchange–correlation energy are presented. Total energy minimization enables us to estimate the equilibrium volume, $c/a$ ratio and the bulk modulus, all of which are in excellent agreement with experiment. We obtain the mass enhancement parameter by using our calculated, $D(E_F)$ and the experimental specific heat data. The $T_c$ is found to be 37 K. We use a parametrized description of the calculated band structure to obtain the $T$ = 0 K values of the London penetration depth and the superconducting coherence length. The penetration depth calculated by us is too small and the coherence length too large as compared to the experimentally determined values of these quantities. This indicates the limitations of a theory that relies only on electronic structure calculations in describing the superconducting state in this material and implies that impurity effects as well as mass renormalization effects need to be included.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present an $ab\ initio$ calculation of interlayer magnetic coupling for Fe/Nb multilayers using the self-consistent full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method. For this calculation, we have constructed supercells consisting of $bcc$ Fe and Nb multilayers in Fe/Nb/Fe sandwich geometry stacked along (001) direction. In the supercells two Fe layers are separated by Nb layers ranging from 1 to 11 layers. We have calculated the total energy of the system as a function of Nb spacer layer thickness. For each spacer layer thickness, we have done three calculations corresponding to para, ferro and antiferromagnetic ordering of Fe atoms. The interlayer magnetic coupling is obtained from the energy difference of the systems in which Fe layers are antiferromagnetically and ferromagnetically ordered. We find that the interlayer magnetic coupling oscillates with increasing Nb spacer thickness in agreement with the experimental results. The induced magnetic moment is also found to be oscillating with increasing Nb spacer layer thickness.</p>

					<p>We have calculated the electronic density of states (DOS) and dielectric function for the ThX (X = P, As and Sb) using the linear muffin tin orbital method within atomic sphere approximation (LMTO–ASA) including the combined correction terms. The calculated electronic DOS of ThSb has been compared with the available experimental data and we find a good agreement. The calculated optical conductivity for ThP and ThAs is increasing monotonically, while for ThSb a sharp peak has been found at 6$\cdot$5 eV. Unfortunately there are no experimental data to compare with calculated optical properties, we hope our calculations will motivate some experimentalists.</p>

				<title>Variations in first principles calculated defect energies in GaAs and their effect on practical predictions</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0169-0173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is an abundant literature on calculations of formation and ionization energies of point defects in GaAs. Since most of these energies, especially the formation energies, are difficult to measure, the calculations are primary means of obtaining their values. However, based on the assumptions of the calculations, the reported values differ greatly among the various calculations. In this paper we discuss the sources of errors and their impact on practical predictions valuable in GaAs device fabrication. In particular, we have compared a large set of computed energies and selected the most appropriate values. Then, in the context of GaAs material quality, we investigated the impact of errors in calculation of formation energies on the performance of the GaAs substrate for device fabrication. We find that in spite of the errors inherent in $ab\ initio$ calculations, it is possible to correctly predict the behaviour of GaAs substrate.</p>

				<title>On the electronic structure and equation of state in high pressure studies of solids</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0175-0181</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the high pressure behaviour of zinc as an interesting example of controversy, and of extensive interplay between theory and experiment. We present its room temperature electronic structure calculations to study the temperature effect on the occurrence of its controversial axial ratio ($c/a$) anomaly under pressure, and the related electronic topological transition (ETT). We have employed a dense 63 $\times$ 63 $\times$ 29 k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone and find that the small ($c/a$) anomaly near 10 GPa pressure persists at room temperature. A weak signature of the anomaly can be seen in the pressure–volume curve, which gets enhanced in the universal equation of state, along with that of $K$-point ETTs. We attribute the change of slope in the universal equation of state near 10 GPa pressure, mainly to hybridization effects. The temperature effect in fact enhances the possibility of $L$-point ETT. We find that the $L$-point ETT is very sensitive to exchange correlation terms, and hence we suggest that further refinements in the theoretical techniques are needed to resolve the controversies on the ETT in Zn.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have carried out electronic structure total energy calculations on rhenium in the hexagonal close packed ($hcp$) and body centred cubic ($bcc$) phases, by the full potential linear muffin–tin orbital method, in order to verify the stability of the ambient pressure $hcp$ phase against transition to the $bcc$ structure at high pressures. As per our results, no $hcp$ to $bcc$ structural transition can occur up to 1 TPa pressures. Moreover, our Bain path calculations show that face centred cubic and body centred tetragonal structures are also not energetically preferred over $hcp$ in this pressure range. The axial ratio ($c/a$) of Re changes by less than 0$\cdot$33% in the pressure range studied.</p>

				<title>Spinodal decomposition in fine grained materials</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0189-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have used a phase field model to study spinodal decomposition in polycrystalline materials in which the grain size is of the same order of magnitude as the characteristic decomposition wavelength ($\lambda_{SD}$). In the spirit of phase field models, each grain ($i$) in our model has an order parameter ($\eta_i$) associated with it; $\eta_i$ has a value of unity inside the $i$th grain, decreases smoothly through the grain boundary region to zero outside the grain. For a symmetric alloy of composition, $c$ = 0$\cdot$5, our results show that microstructural evolution depends largely on the difference in the grain boundary energies, $\gamma_{gb}$, of A-rich ($\alpha$) and B-rich ($\beta$) phases. If $\gamma^{\alpha}_{gb}$ is lower, we find that the decomposition process is initiated with an $\alpha$ layer being formed at the grain boundary. If the grain size is sufficiently small (about the same as $\lambda_{SD}$), the interior of the grain is filled with the $\beta$ phase. If the grain size is large (say, about 10 $\lambda_{SD}$ or greater), the early stage microstructure exhibits an A-rich grain boundary layer followed by a B-rich layer; the grain interior exhibits a spinodally decomposed microstructure, evolving slowly. Further, grain growth is suppressed completely during the decomposition process.</p>

				<page>0193-0197</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the evolution of microstructure when a disordered ternary alloy is quenched into a ternary miscibility gap. We have used computer simulations based on multicomponent Cahn–Hilliard (CH) equations for $c_A$ and $c_B$, the compositions (in mole fraction) of A and B, respectively. In this work, we present our results on the effect of relative interfacial energies on the temporal evolution of morphologies during spinodal phase separation of an alloy with average composition, $c_A$ = 1/4, $c_B$ = 1/4 and $c_C$ = 1/2. Interfacial energies between the ‘A’ rich, ‘B’ rich and ‘C’ rich phases are varied by changing the gradient energy coefficients. The phases associated with a higher interfacial energy are found to be more rounded than those with lower energy. Further, the kinetic paths (i.e. the history of A-rich, B-rich and C-rich regions in the microstructure) are also affected significantly by the relative interfacial energies of the three phases.</p>

				<title>The promise of fuel cell-based automobiles</title>
				<feature>Fuel Cells</feature>
				<page>0207-0214</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fuel cell-based automobiles have gained attention in the last few years due to growing public concern about urban air pollution and consequent environmental problems. From an analysis of the power and energy requirements of a modern car, it is estimated that a base sustainable power of $ca$. 50 kW supplemented with short bursts up to 80 kW will suffice in most driving requirements. The energy demand depends greatly on driving characteristics but under normal usage is expected to be 200 Wh/km. The advantages and disadvantages of candidate fuel-cell systems and various fuels are considered together with the issue of whether the fuel should be converted directly in the fuel cell or should be reformed to hydrogen onboard the vehicle. For fuel cell vehicles to compete successfully with conventional internal-combustion engine vehicles, it appears that direct conversion fuel cells using probably hydrogen, but possibly methanol, are the only realistic contenders for road transportation applications. Among the available fuel cell technologies, polymer–electrolyte fuel cells directly fueled with hydrogen appear to be the best option for powering fuel cell vehicles as there is every prospect that these will exceed the performance of the internal-combustion engine vehicles but for their first cost. A target cost of &#36; 50/kW would be mandatory to make polymer–electrolyte fuel cells competitive with the internal combustion engines and can only be achieved with design changes that would substantially reduce the quantity of materials used. At present, prominent car manufacturers are deploying important research and development efforts to develop fuel cell vehicles and are projecting to start production by 2005.</p>

				<feature>Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0217-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mullite was developed by reaction sintering of sillimanite beach sand and calcined alumina. Two varieties of sillimanite beach sand viz. S and Z having different compositions were selected. Synthesis and properties of mullite were very much dependent on the sillimanite beach sand composition. Presence of higher amount of impurities in the Z-variety of sillimanite sand favours the densification by liquid phase formation. Presence of zircon in Z-variety increases the hardness and fracture toughness. Alumina addition improves the mechanical/thermomechanical properties of the samples. Mullite retains the usual orthorhombic habit of sillimanite. Rounded to sub rounded zirconia dispersed within the mullite matrix of the sample ZA is noticed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The synthesis of titania membrane through sol–gel route involves hydrolysis of alkoxide, peptization of hydrous oxide of titanium to obtain a sol, adjustment of the sol viscosity by including a binder and filtration of the viscous sol through a microporous support, gelation and sintering to desired temperature. The binder plays an important role in that it not only helps in adjustment of sol viscosity but also helps in binding the sol particle with porous support. Here a comparative study on the role of different binders, viz. polyvinyl alcohol, polyethyleneimine, polyacrylamide, effect of their viscosity and surface tension effect on the morphology of the titania membrane is presented. The results show that among the three binders studied polyvinyl alcohol gave rise to membranes of desired characteristics when the sol viscosity was 0$\cdot$08 pa.s.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Silica sols synthesized through different routes viz. inorganic, organic and ion-exchange routes, have been incorporated in the low cement alumina castable composition in various proportions and cast samples in the form of 2 inch cube briquettes were prepared. The cast briquettes after curing were subjected to heat treatment at various temperatures. The effect of different sources of such sols on the important physico-mechanical properties of the castables such as bulk density, apparent porosity, compressive strength, volume shrinkage and residual strength after spalling have been studied. Some of the selected samples were also subjected to microstructural evaluation. It is observed that silica sol synthesized through cation exchange routes has significant beneficial role on the properties of castable with 3% addition.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Multilayer superlattice coatings of TiN/CrN were deposited on silicon substrates using a reactive d.c. magnetron sputtering process. Superlattice period, also known as modulation wavelength ($\Lambda$), was controlled by controlling the dwell time of the substrate underneath Ti and Cr targets. X-ray diffraction (XRD), nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize the films. The XRD data showed 1st and 2nd order satellite reflections along the principal reflection for films having 132 Å $\geq \Lambda \geq$ 84 Å, thus confirming the formation of superlattice. The multilayer coatings exhibited hardness ($H$) as high as 3200 kg/mm$^2$, which is 2 times the rule-of-mixtures value (i.e. $H_{TiN}$ = 2200 kg/mm$^2$ and $H_{CrN}$ = 1000 kg/mm$^2$). Detailed investigations on the effects of various process parameters indicated that hardness of the superlattice coatings was affected not only by modulation wavelength but also by nitrogen partial pressure and ion bombardment during deposition.</p>

Films crack upon deposition due to internal stresses and leads to performance degradation. In this investigation, we report the preparation and characterization of single and multi-layer films of TiO$_2$, CeO$_2$, Substance2 (E Merck, Germany), Al$_2$O$_3$, SiO$_2$ and MgF$_2$ by electron beam evaporation on both glass and PMMA substrates. Optical micrographs taken on single layer films deposited on PMMA substrates did not reveal any cracks. Cracks in films were observed on PMMA substrates when the substrate temperature exceeded 80$^\circ $C. Antireflection coatings of 3 and 4 layers have been deposited and characterized. Antireflection coatings made on PMMA substrate using Substance2 (H2) and SiO$_2$ combination showed very fine cracks when observed under microscope. Optical performance of the coatings has been explained with the help of optical micrographs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The electrical properties of polycrystalline Bi$_6$Fe$_2$Ti$_3$O$_{18}$ are investigated by impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 30–550$^\circ $C. The imaginary part of impedance as a function of frequency shows Debye like relaxation. Impedance data are presented in the Nyquist plot which is used to identify an equivalent circuit and the fundamental circuit parameters are determined at different temperatures. The grain and grain-boundary contributions are estimated. The results of bulk a.c. conductivity as a function of temperature and frequency are presented. The activation energies for the a.c. conductivity are calculated. The polaron hopping frequencies are estimated from the a.c. conductivity data.</p>

					<p>Undoped KDP and KDP crystals containing KI/NaI with/without gold doping were grown by slow evaporation technique. All the grown crystals were γ -irradiated using ${}^{60}$Co source. Electrical conductivity measurements were carried out on all these crystals perpendicular to the unique direction before and after $\gamma$-irradiation. The present results show that the conductivity of KDP crystals increases with the addition of KI/NaI and with gold doping as well as upon rise in temperature.

					<p>Systematic microhardness measurements have been made on rubidium halide mixed crystals (RbBr–RbI and KI–RbI) and rubidium halide crystals doped with Sr$^{2+}$ ions. The composition dependence of the hardness of mixed crystals follows the law $\Delta H_V$ = $K\ x$ (1–$x$), where $\Delta H_V$ is the enhancement in hardness, $K$ a constant and $x$ and (1 – $x$) the concentrations of the first and second component of the mixed crystals, respectively.

					<p>In this paper the results of thermally stimulated discharge current (TSDC) and dielectric constant for 40PbO–60Bi$_2$O$_3$ glass thermoelectrets are presented. Measurements of TSDC and dielectric constant, $\varepsilon'$, have been carried out in the temperature range 30–300$^\circ $C. The thermoelectrets were prepared at different polarizing fields. The various observed peaks in the thermograms are discussed on the basis of space charge polarization. The trap energy is evaluated from the Garlick–Gibson plot of initial rise method. Similarly other parameters such as relaxation time, charge release etc are evaluated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The microstructure in the inter-critical heat-affected zone (ICHAZ) of HQ130 steel, has been investigated by thermo-simulation test, SEM and TEM. The problem of toughness decrease in the ICHAZ ($T_p$ = 800$^\circ $C) as well as the effect of M–A constituent and carbide precipitation on brittleness was analysed. The test results indicated that the microstructure in the ICHAZ of HQ130 steel was mostly a mixture of lath martensite (ML) and granular bainite (Bg) with a fine but nonuniform grain structure. The cause of brittleness in the ICHAZ was related to production of the M–A constituent in the local region and carbide precipitation. By controlling the welding heat input carbide precipitation and the formation of the M–A constituent can be avoided or decreased.</p>

The synthesized sample was characterized by XRD, SEM, FT-IR, TG/DTA, ${}^{27}$Al and ${}^{31}$P MASNMR techniques, which shows that the synthesized sample was highly crystalline. Carbon and nitrogen analyses reveal that the sample contains no template molecules, however, TG/DTA analysis shows the presence of physisorbed template molecules. MASNMR results show the presence of three different types of aluminium and phosphorous. Two of them were present as in tetrahedral and the remaining one is present in octahedral environment.</p>

				<title>On the morphology of SrCO$_3$ crystals grown at the interface between two immiscible liquids</title>
				<feature>Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0283-0288</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we report on the growth of strontianite crystals at the interface between an aqueous solution of Sr$^{2+}$ ions and organic solutions of chloroform and hexane containing fatty acid/fatty amine molecules by reaction with sodium carbonate. When fatty acid was used as an additive at the interface, the crystals grown were self-assembled needle shaped strontianite crystallites branching out from the seed crystal via secondary nucleation. Under identical conditions of supersaturation, the presence of fatty amine molecules at the liquid–liquid interface resulted in needle shaped strontianite crystals with spherical crystallites arranged around central needles. This clearly indicates that the functionality of the head group of the amphiphiles at the liquid–liquid interface affects the morphology of the strontium carbonate crystals formed. The use of interfacial effects such as dielectric discontinuity, polarity and finite solubility of the two solvents etc opens up exciting possibilities for tailoring the morphology of crystals at the liquid–liquid interface and is currently not possible in the more popular crystal growth with similar amphiphiles at the air–water interface.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Manganese doped zinc sulfide nanoparticles are fabricated on polyvinyl alcohol dielectric matrix. They are bombarded with energetic chlorine ions (100 MeV). The size of the crystallites is found to increase with ion fluence due to melting led grain growth under ion irradiation. The increased size as a result of grain growth has been observed both in the optical absorption spectra in terms of redshift and in electron microscopic images. The photoluminescence (PL) study was carried out by band to band excitation ($\lambda_{ex}$ = 220 nm) upon ZnS : Mn, which results into two emission peaks corresponding to surface states and Mn$^{+2}$ emission, respectively. The ion fluence for irradiation experiment so chosen were 1 $\times$ 10$^{11}$, 5 $\times$ 10$^{11}$, 5 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ and 10$^{13}$ Cl/cm$^2$.</p>

				<title>Microstructure characterization in the weld metals of HQ130 + QJ63 high strength steels</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Microstructural characterization of the weld metals of HQ130 + QJ63 high strength steels, welded under 80% Ar + 20% CO$_2$ gas shielded metal arc welding and different weld heat inputs, was carried out by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The relative contents of acicular ferrite (AF) and pro-eutectic ferrites (PF) in the weld metals were evaluated by means of XQF-2000 micro-image analyser. The experimental results indicate that there is acicular ferrite in the grain and some pro-eutectic ferrite on the boundary of original austenite grains when the weld heat input is small ($E$ = 9$\cdot$6 kJ/cm), but the main microstructure is ferrite side plate (FSP) when the heat input is larger ($E$ = 22$\cdot$3 kJ/cm). So the weld heat input should be strictly controlled in the range 10 $\sim$ 20 kJ/cm and then the content of pro-eutectic ferrite is limited to $\lt$ 25%. Thus weld metals of HQ130 + QJ63 high strength steels with high toughness and excellent resistance to cracking can be ensured.</p>

					<p>Room temperature dry sliding wear behaviour of iron aluminides containing 28% aluminium and various amounts of chromium has been investigated using pin on disk wear tester. The aluminides were heat treated to have ordered $DO_3$ structure. It was found that wear rate of the aluminides increased with the increase of applied normal load and sliding speed. Wear resistance of the aluminides increased with increase in chromium content. SEM observation of the worn surface showed that the microcutting and microploughing were the dominant sliding wear mechanisms.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two compositions of conventional aluminium base alloys were selected and equal amounts of tin and lead as a soft phase were incorporated separately. Impeller mixing and chill casting technique were employed for the preparation of the alloys. Mechanical properties of as cast alloys were evaluated at room temperature. Frictional behaviour of the alloys was studied in detail under lubrication while creating different frictional states by imposing 5–60 kg of normal load on the bearing (bush) mating surface. It was found that aluminium tin and leaded aluminium alloys slightly differ in mechanical properties. Frictional states created during sliding against steel shaft (hardness 55–60 Rc) under oil lubrication were not much different. Leaded aluminium alloy bushes show marginally lower friction than the conventional ones.</p>

				<title>Conductivity behaviour of polymer gel electrolytes: Role of polymer</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0321-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Polymer is an important constituent of polymer gel electrolytes along with salt and solvent. The salt provides ions for conduction and the solvent helps in the dissolution of the salt and also provides the medium for ion conduction. Although the polymer added provides mechanical stability to the electrolytes yet its effect on the conductivity behaviour of gel electrolytes as well as the interaction of polymer with salt and solvent has not been conclusively established. The conductivity of lithium ion conducting polymer gel electrolytes decreases with the addition of polymer whereas in the case of proton conducting polymer gel electrolytes an increase in conductivity has been observed with polymer addition. This has been explained to be due to the role of polymer in increasing viscosity and carrier concentration in these gel electrolytes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chloride doped polyaniline conducting polymer films have been prepared in a protic acid medium (HCl) by potentiodynamic method in an electrochemical cell and studied by cyclic voltammetry and FTIR techniques. The FTIR spectra confirmed Cl$^{-}$ ion doping in the polymers. The polymerization rate was found to increase with increasing concentration of aniline monomer. But the films obtained at high monomer concentration were rough having a nonuniform flaky polyaniline distribution. Results showed that the polymerization rate did not increase beyond a critical HCl concentration. Cyclic voltammetry suggested that, the oxidation-reduction current increased with an increase in scan rate and that the undoped polyaniline films were not hygroscopic whereas chloride doped polyaniline films were found to be highly hygroscopic.</p>

				<title>Optical absorption and fluorescent behaviour of titanium ions in silicate glasses</title>
				<feature>Glasses</feature>
				<page>0335-0341</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Titanium in normal melting conditions in air atmosphere present as Ti$^{4+}$ ion in basic silicate glasses exhibited an ultra-violet cut-off in silicate glasses, viz. soda–magnesia–silica, soda–magnesia–lime–silica and soda–lime–silica glasses. This indicates that Ti$^{4+}$ ion can be a good replacement for Ce$^{4+}$ ion in producing UV-absorbing silicate glasses for commercial applications. The wavelength maxima at which the infinite absorption takes place in glasses was found to be around 310 nm against Ti-free blank glass in UV-region. The mechanism of electronic transition from O$^{2-}$ ligands to Ti$^{4+}$ ion was suggested as L $\rightarrow$ M charge transfer. The low energy tails of the ultra-violet cut-off were found to obey Urbach’s rule in the optical range 360–500 nm. The fluorescence spectra of these glasses were also studied and based on the radiative fluorescent properties it was suggested that the soda–lime–silica glass containing Ti$^{4+}$ ion with greater emission crosssection would emit a better fluorescence than the corresponding soda–magnesia–lime–silica and soda–magnesia–silica glasses. The shift of emission wavelengths maxima towards longer wavelength in titania introduced silicate glasses was observed on replacement of MgO by CaO which may be attributed due to an increase in basicity of the glass system.</p>

					<p>Significant results of our experimental investigations on the dependence of pH on real time transmission characteristics on recording media fabricated by doping PVC with complexed methylene blue are presented. The optimum pH value for faster bleaching was found to be 4$\cdot$5. In typical applications, the illumination from one side, normal to the surface of this material, initiates a chemical sequence that records the incident light pattern in the polymer. Thus direct imaging can be successfully done on this sample. The recorded letters were very legible with good contrast and no scattering centres. Diffraction efficiency measurements were also carried out on this material.</p>

				<title>Formation of complex anodic films on porous alumina matrices</title>
				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0349-0353</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of growth of complex anodic alumina films was investigated. These films were formed by filling porous oxide films (matrices) having deep pores. The porous films (matrices) were obtained voltastatically in (COOH)$_2$ aqueous solution under various voltages. The filling was done by re-anodization in an electrolyte solution not dissolving the film. Data about the kinetics of re-anodization depending on the porosity of the matrices were obtained. On the other hand, the slopes of the kinetic curves during reanodization were calculated by two equations expressing the dependence of these slopes on the ionic current density. A discrepancy was ascertained between the values of the calculated slopes and those experimentally found. For this discrepancy a possible explanation is proposed, related to the temperature increase in the film, because of that the real current density significantly increases during re-anodization.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mathematical modeling of supersonic gas atomization for spray forming has been investigated. Influence of the droplet dynamic and thermal behaviour on the resultant microstructure has been studied. Analytical models have been constructed taking into account the higher Reynolds number owing to supersonic gas flow. The impact velocity profiles of the droplets lend credence to the evolution of equiaxed grain morphology through dendrite fragmentation. The thermal history profile along with the fraction solid plot could yield optimized standoff distance to obtain a mushy droplet. A comparison of secondary dendrite arm spacing obtained from the mathematical model showed good agreement with experimental observations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>High dielectric constant (high-$k$) Ta$_2$O$_5$ films have been deposited on ZnO/$p$-Si substrate by microwave plasma at 150$^\circ $C. Structure and composition of the ZnO/$p$-Si films have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for chemical composition. The electrical properties of the Ta$_2$O$_5$/ZnO/$p$-Si metal insulator semiconductor (MIS) structures were studied using high frequency capacitance–voltage ($C–V$), conductance–voltage ($G–V$) and current–voltage ($I–V$) characteristics. Charged trapping properties have been studied by measuring the gate voltage shift due to trapped charge generation under Fowler–Nordheim ($F–N$) constant current stressing.</p>

				<title>Influence of N atomic percentages on cell attachment for CN$_x$ coatings</title>
				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0371-0375</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbon film is an excellent candidate for use as a biocompatible coating due to its excellent properties. However, considerable attention has just been focused on the biocompatibility of diamond-like carbon (DLC) in recent years. It is difficult to find reports on the investigations of the biocompatibility of CN$_x$ so far. It is well known that CN$_x$ has similar structural characteristics as that of DLC. Its excellent mechanical and tribological properties are comparable to that of DLC. In addition, it is probable that the presence of nitrogen leads to a positive effect on biocompatibility. So, this work focusses on cell attachment of CN$_x$ coating and the relation between nitrogen atomic percentage and cell attachment.</p>
					<p>CN$_x$ coatings were prepared using magnetron sputtering under two N$_2$ partial pressures for the evaluation of relation between nitrogen atomic percentage and cell attachment. Cell culture tests using human endothelial cells and mouse fibroblasts were performed. Both coatings resulted in no adverse effects on the cells in culture. Compared with CN$_x$ ($x$ = 0$\cdot$088), CN$_x$ ($x$ = 0$\cdot$149) film provided a better surface for normal cellular attachment, spreading and proliferation without apparent impairment of cell physiology. At the same time, the coatings exhibited excellent tribological and corrosion performance. XPS and AES analyses showed that higher nitrogen atomic percentage might lead to a positive effect on the cell attachment.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Eu$^{3+}$ activated CaSiO$_3$, (Ca, Ba) SiO$_3$ and (Ca, Sr) SiO$_3$ have been prepared by sol–gel technique. Residual solvent and organic contents in the gel were removed by firing at 100$^\circ $C for 3–4 h at 300 and 600$^\circ $C for 2 h. Small exothermic shoulder around 850 to 875$^\circ $C, as observed in DTA curve, corresponds to crystallization temperature of the doped calcium silicate. Influence of firing temperature on the luminescence of Eu$^{3+}$ shows the maximum emission intensity in gel fired at 850$^\circ $C. Photoluminescence emission peak is observed at 614 nm due to ${}^{5}D_{0} \rightarrow {}^{7}F_{2}$ transition of Eu$^{3+}$ ion in (Ca, Ba) SiO$_3$ and (Ca, Sr) SiO$_3$ phosphors, when excited by 254 nm. The (Ca, Ba) SiO$_3$ material is proposed as an efficient red phosphor.</p>

The specimens were prepared using the mixed oxide route by adding different mol% of Nd$_2$O$_3$ (0$\cdot$1 to 7 mol%) in [Pb(Zr, Ti)O$_3$] near morphotropic phase boundary. Piezoelectric equivalent circuit parameters $R$, $L$, $C_a$ in series and $C_b$ in parallel have been determined by simulating /Z/ and $\Theta$ plots. Electromechanical coupling coefficients and strain constants for the radial modes show a peak at about 3 mol%, the dielectric constant peaks at about 1 mol% and voltage constants peak at about 0$\cdot$75 mol% of Nd$_2$O$_3$.</p>

				<title>Development of hardened PVF : PMMA polyblend: effect of gamma and electron irradiation</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0401-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Specimens of poly(vinyl formal) (PVF) : poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polyblends with different weight percentage ratios were subjected to gamma irradiation (1 to 50 Mrad) and electron irradiation (1 to 20 Mrad). The effect of irradiation on the strength of the blend specimens was studied by measuring the surface microhardness using a Vickers microhardness tester attached to a Carl Zeiss NU 2 Universal research microscope. Significant changes were observed in the Vickers microhardness number, $H_v$. The $H_v$ values of gamma irradiated specimens are found to be higher than the unirradiated specimens indicating an occurrence of radiational crosslinking. The maximum value of $H_v$ is obtained at the gamma radiation dose of 15 Mrad. In case of electron irradiation the radiational crosslinking is found to take place for the blend specimens having lower wt% content of PMMA (0 and 1 wt%) in PVF matrix. On the other hand degradation of polymeric system is observed for the blends having PMMA content more than 1 wt%. The maximum value of $H_v$ is obtained for all the blend specimens at the electron irradiation dose of 8 Mrad. The degree of crosslinking in polyblends due to gamma irradiation is found to be more than electron irradiation. The scissioning mechanism is found to predominate in the polyblend system in case of electron irradiation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Na$^{+}$ ion conductivity has been studied in SnO$\cdot$NaPO$_3$ glasses, which have been prepared over a wide range of compositions using a microwave melting technique. D.c. activation barriers seem to reflect the structural changes in system. A.c. conductivity analysis has revealed that while the power law exponent, $s$, seem to bear correlation to the structural changes, the exponent $\beta$ of the stretched exponential function describing the dielectric relaxation is largely insensitive to the structure. Possible importance of the correlation of transport property to the variation of available non-bridging oxygen (NBO) atoms in the structure is discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A study on the development of a fully injectable calcium phosphate cement for orthopedic and dental applications is presented. The paper describes its characteristic properties including results of bio- compatibility studies.</p>
					<p>A conventional two-component calcium phosphate cement formulation (having a powder part containing dry mixture of acidic and basic calcium phosphate particles and a liquid part containing phosphate solution) is modified with a biocompatible gelling agent, to induce flow properties and cohesion. The quantity of the gelling agent is optimized to get a viscous paste, which is smoothly injectable through an 18-gauge needle, with clinically relevant setting parameters.</p>
					<p>The new formulation has a setting time of 20 min and a compressive strength of 11 MPa. The X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and energy dispersive electron microprobe analyses showed the phase to be hydroxyapatite, the basic bone mineral. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a porous structure with particle sizes of a few micrometers. The cement did not show any appreciable dimensional or thermal change during setting. The injectability is estimated by extruding through needle and the cohesive property is assessed by water contact method. The cement passed the in vitro biocompatibility screening (cytotoxicity and haemolysis) tests.</p>

				<title>Existence domains for invariant reactions in binary regular solution phase diagrams exhibiting two phases</title>
				<feature>Biomaterials</feature>
				<page>0423-0430</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The thermodynamic origin of various types of phase diagrams in simple binary systems exhibiting two phases (e.g. a liquid and a solid phase) has been examined using the regular solution model. The necessary conditions for the occurrence of each of these types are identified in terms of the appropriate intersections of the miscibility gap boundaries (in solid/liquid phases) and the liquidus/solidus/iso-$G$ curves. Thus, the regions of occurrence of the different types of possible phase diagrams in the space of the regular solution interchange energy parameters ($W^{\alpha} , W^{\beta}$) are clearly delineated. This analysis makes it easier to make intelligent initial selections of model (energy) parameters for their optimization in the calculation of phase diagrams using thermodynamic models such as CALPHAD/CVM.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of Cl$^{–}$ on the corrosive wear behaviour of AISI 321 stainless steel in H$_2$SO$_4$ solution was studied via the corrosive wear rate, the load bearing capacity of passive film and the relationship between pitting and corrosive wear. There is a critical load at natural potential, below which the corrosive wear rate is slightly lowered by Cl$^{–}$, while above which is increased. At natural potential there are more pits at low load than that at a higher one in the wear tracks and the pits are also deeper. The load bearing capacity is lowered by Cl$^{–}$ at passive region and then the corrosive wear rate increased.</p>

				<title>Aging of a copper bearing HSLA-100 steel</title>
				<feature>Biomaterials</feature>
				<page>0441-0447</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Investigations were carried out on aging of a HSLA-100 steel after varying amounts of cold deformation. Mechanical properties (hardness, tensile properties and toughness) were measured and structural changes were studied using optical, TEM and SEM techniques. As a result of various treatments, the hardness and UTS could be significantly improved, but with drastic fall in ductility and impact strength, especially in peak aged conditions. The parameters affecting impact strength were examined and it was concluded that various microstructural features affected toughness through their influence on tensile properties. In this steel the impact strength could be improved by lowering the UTS and increasing the ductility (pct elongation). The improvement in hardness and UTS was attributed to formation of thick precipitate-dislocation tangles. The aging process caused a slow transformation of lath martensite into acicular ferrite due to occurrence of $in\ situ$ recrystallization. The concentration of Cu in particles precipitating on aging was followed using EDAX technique.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal analysis is a widely used analytical technique for materials research. However, thermal analysis with simultaneous evolved gas analysis describes the thermal event more precisely and completely. Among various gas analytical techniques, mass spectrometry has many advantages. Hence, an ultra high vacuum (UHV) compatible mass spectrometry based evolved gas analysis (EGA–MS) system has been developed. This system consists of a measurement chamber housing a mass spectrometer, spinning rotor gauge and vacuum gauges coupled to a high vacuum, high temperature reaction chamber. A commercial thermogravimetric analyser (TGA: TG + DTA) is interfaced to it. Additional mass flow based gas/vapour delivery system and calibration gas inlets have been added to make it a versatile TGA–EGA–MS facility. This system which gives complete information on weight change, heat change, nature and content of evolved gases is being used for</p>

					<p>The TPD of various inorganic oxyanion solids are studied and reaction intermediates/products are analysed off-line. The dynamic operating conditions are found to yield nanocrystalline products in many cases. This paper essentially describes design features involved in coupling the existing EGA–MS system to TGA, associated fluid handling systems, the system calibration procedures and results on temperature programmed decomposition. In addition, synthesis of a few nanocrystalline oxides by vacuum thermal decomposition, gas analysis and potential use of this facility as controlled atmosphere exposure facility for studying gas–solid interactions are also described.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>12 V/25 AH gelled-electrolyte valve-regulated lead-acid batteries have been assembled in-house and their performance studied in relation to the absorptive glass-microfibre valve-regulated and flooded-electrolyte counterparts at various discharge rates and temperatures between -40$^\circ $C and 40$^\circ $C. Although the performance of the gelled-electrolyte valve-regulated battery is similar to both the absorptive glass-microfibre valve-regulated and flooded-electrolyte lead-acid batteries at temperatures above 0$^\circ $C, it is superior to both the flooded-electrolyte and absorptive glass-microfibre valve-regulated lead-acid batteries at temperatures between 0$^\circ $C and -40$^\circ $C. The latter characteristic is attractive for expanding the application regime of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries. The corrosion rate for the positive grids in the gelled-electrolyte is also lower than both the flooded-electrolyte and absorptive glass-microfibre configurations.</p>

				<title>Influence of $w/c$ ratio on rate of chloride induced corrosion of steel reinforcement and its dependence on ambient temperature</title>
				<feature>Corrosion</feature>
				<page>0471-0475</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The permeability of the embedding cement material for the rate of chloride induced corrosion when the ambient temperature is increased has found a dominant position. The importance of the given permeability in the process is based on the fact that it represents a factor conditioning the possibility of the escaping of the unambiguous reaction partners, oxygen and water vapour, from the system embedding cement material$—$steel, as the ambient temperature is increased. The resulting effect is a slowing down of the corrosion rate when the $w/c$ ratio over the value 0$\cdot$6 and the ambient temperature over the value 40$^\circ $C are increased.</p>
					<p>Due to the similarity of the chemism of the corrosion process of steel reinforcement, independent of the action of aggressive species, the found relationships are generally valid, e.g. for the corrosion due to carbonation.</p>

					<p>Rapid solidification by planar flow casting has been found to have introduced deficiencies, viz. partial crystallinity, air pockets and compositional difference in the ribbons of rapidly solidified Ti$_{42\cdot9}$Cu$_{57\cdot1}$ alloy. In order to investigate the effects of these deficiencies on the corrosion of rapidly solidified Ti$_{42\cdot9}$Cu$_{57\cdot1}$ alloy ribbons, electrochemical behaviour of alloy ribbons has been investigated in the acidic chloride environments at room temperature by taking into consideration each side of the alloy ribbon separately. The alloy displayed passivity followed by pitting corrosion. In the as-solidified condition, air pockets appear to be the most detrimental defect from the viewpoint of corrosion resistance of the alloy ribbons.</p>

					<p>Polycrystalline soft ferrites, Zn$_x$ Cu$_{1–x}$ Fe$_2$O$_4$ ($x$ = 0$\cdot$30, 0$\cdot$50, 0$\cdot$70, 0$\cdot$80 and 0$\cdot$90), doped with controlled amount of calcium chloride (CaCl$_2$) were prepared by standard ceramic route and studied for a.c. susceptibility. X-ray diffraction studies of the compositions reveal formation of single-phase cubic spinel. The values of lattice constant increase as doping percentage of CaCl$_2$ increased from 0$\cdot$01% to 0$\cdot$05% and afterwards decrease slightly. The presence of chlorine ions is confirmed by absorption peak in far IR spectra near 650 cm$^{-1}$ for all the samples. The variation of a.c. susceptibility with temperature shows the existence of single domain structure for $x$ = 0$\cdot$3 and exhibits transition from single domain to multidomain structure with increased Ca$^{2+}$ contents from 0$\cdot$01 to 0$\cdot$1%. The composition, $x$ = 0$\cdot$5, shows multidomain structure independent of Ca$^{2+}$ content. The samples for $x$ = 0$\cdot$70, 0$\cdot$80 and 0$\cdot$90 show paramagnetic behaviour at and above room temperature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Microwave sintering (MS) method has been successfully used for densifying Mn–Zn ferrites used for high frequency applications. This method needs only a short time to obtain high density when compared to conventionally sintered (CS) Mn–Zn ferrites. The lowest power loss was also achieved at 100 kHz and 200 mT condition for the microwave sintered samples. Conductor-embedded ferrite transformers were constructed using CS and MS samples and output power, efficiency, and surface rise of temperature were measured at sinusoidal voltage of 25 V with frequency, 1 MHz. The efficiency and surface rise of temperature of transformer were found to be high and low, respectively.</p>

					<p>At room temperature, Mössbauer spectra of Sn$^{4+}$/Nb$^{5+}$ substituted Mn–Zn ferrites have been taken to understand the site occupancy of substituted ions. The results indicate that both the substituted ions occupy tetrahedral (A) site only at lower concentration of substitution while at higher concentration they occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral sites. At higher concentration of Nb substitution a doublet has been observed besides sextets. The possibility of canting existence on octahedral sites has been discussed.

					<p>Cobalt ferrite (Co$_x$Fe$_{3–x}$O$_4$) is prepared in powder form by thermal decomposition of iron and cobalt salts and is analysed by X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopic techniques. The variation of Mössbauer parameters, lattice parameters and crystallite size of the products formed with variation in the composition of Fe and Co ratios are studied.

				<abstract>
					<p>The samples of the series Co$_{1+y}$Sn$_y$Fe$_{2–2y–x}$Cr$_x$O$_4$ ferrites with $x$ = 0$\cdot$0, 0$\cdot$1, 0$\cdot$2, 0$\cdot$3, 0$\cdot$4, 0$\cdot$5 and $y$ = 0$\cdot$05, were prepared by the usual double sintering ceramic technique. The single-phase spinel structure of the samples was confirmed by using X-ray diffractometry technique. The lattice parameter ‘$a$’ with an accuracy of $\pm$ 0$\cdot$002 Å were determined using Bragg peaks of XRD pattern. The lattice parameter ‘$a$’ decreases with concentration, $x$, which is due to the difference in the ionic radii of Cr$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ ions. The X-ray intensity calculations were carried out in order to determine the possible cation distribution amongst tetrahedral (A) and octahedral [B] sites. The X-ray intensity calculations show Cr$^{3+}$ ions occupying B site. The saturation magnetization, $\sigma_{s}$, and magneton number, $n_B$ (the saturation magnetization per formula unit), measured at 300 K determined from high field hysteresis loop technique decrease with increase in concentration, $x$, suggesting a decrease in ferrimagnetic behaviour. Thermal variation of low field a.c. susceptibility measurements from room temperature to about 800 K exhibits almost normal ferrimagnetic behaviour and the Curie temperature, $T_C$ determined from a.c. susceptibility data decreases with increase in $x$.</p>

				<title>Heat-deproteinated xenogeneic bone from slaughterhouse waste: Physico-chemical properties</title>
				<feature>Biomaterials</feature>
				<page>0523-0528</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Xenogeneic bone procured from the slaughterhouse waste was deproteinated by heat treatment method intended for use as a bone substitute. The effect of heat treatment was investigated by thermal analysis and by physico-chemical methods such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The heat treatment temperatures for the bovine bone samples were predetermined by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The XRD results revealed that the process of heat treatment promoted the crystallinity of bone samples, particularly at 700 and 900$^\circ $C. There was no secondary phase transformation detected for heat-deproteinated bone except the presence of the hydroxyapatite (HA) phase, which indicated its phase purity even at a higher temperature. The FTIR spectra of raw bone and bone heated at 300$^\circ $C indicated the presence of organic macromolecules whereas these disappeared in the samples heated at 500, 700 and 900$^\circ $C, which suggested the removal of antigenic organic matters around 500$^\circ $C. The same results were also confirmed quantitatively by calculating the amount of collagen using hydroxyproline estimation. There was no significant change in the TG-thermogram of bone heated at 500, 700 and 900$^\circ $C, which indicated their thermal stability. These findings implied that the heat treated bone at 500$^\circ $C had properties similar to carbonated HA with low crystallinity, while 700 and 900$^\circ $C samples had the same with higher crystallinity. As low temperature treatment does not alter morphological and structural properties, we propose that the 500$^\circ $C heat treated xenogeneic bone may act as an excellent osteogenic bone substitute.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polyaniline (Pani) and its metal oxalate composites ($\sim$ 10 wt.%) of trivalent metal ions of Cr, Fe, Mn, Co and Al were synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization technique with potassium perdisulphate oxidant in aqueous sulphuric acid medium. These materials were characterized by UV–VIS and EPR spectral techniques. Their d.c. electrical conductivities at room temperature and also as a function of temperature (307–453 K) were measured by four-probe technique. Presence of radical cation/polaron transition was indicated by UV–VIS absorption peak and EPR signals. Further, a close correlation existed between the conductivities and EPR parameters such as line width and peak ratio, which demonstrated that both mobile and fixed spins are involved in these composites. The dependence of conductivity on temperature, when analysed graphically by VRH, GB and TC mechanisms, pointed out that VRH is the predominant charge transport mechanism in these materials.</p>

The dependence of the glass transition temperature ($T_g$), the crystalline temperature ($T_c$) and the peak temperature of crystallization ($T_p$) on the composition and heating rate ($\beta$) has been studied. For a memory/switching material, the thermal stability and ease of glass formation are of crucial importance. The glass transition temperature, $T_g$, increases slightly with the variation of Bi content. From the heating rate dependence of $T_g$, the activation energy for glass transition ($E_t$) has been evaluated. The results are discussed on the basis of Kissinger’s approach and are interpreted using the chemically ordered network model (CONM).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry were carried out to study the transformation from amorphous to icosahedral/crystalline phases in the rapidly quenched Al$_{50}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_5$ and Al$_{45}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_{10}$ alloys. In the present investigation, we have studied the formation and stability of amorphous phase in Al$_{50}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_5$ and Al$_{45}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_{10}$ rapidly quenched alloys. The DSC curve shows a broad complex type of exothermic overlapping peaks (288–550$^\circ $C) for Al$_{50}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_5$ and a well defined peak around 373$^\circ $C for Al$_{45}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_{10}$ alloy. In the case of Al$_{50}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_5$ alloy amorphous to icosahedral phase transformation has been observed after annealing at 280$^\circ $C for 73 h. Large dendritic growth of icosahedral phase along with $\alpha$-Al phase has been found. Annealing of Al$_{50}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_5$ alloy at 400$^\circ $C for 8 h results in formation of Al$_3$Ti type phase. Al$_{45}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_{10}$ amorphous alloy is more stable in comparison to Al$_{50}$Cu$_{45}$Ti$_5$ alloy and after annealing at 400$^\circ $C for 8 h it also transforms to Al$_3$Ti type phase. However, this alloy does not show amorphous to icosahedral phase transformation.</p>

				<feature>Liquid Crystals</feature>
				<page>0559-0563</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of liquid crystalline derivatives of lithocholic acid were prepared using simple chemical reactions involving the terminal functional group—hydroxyl at C-3 and/or carboxyl at C-24. Thus methyl -3-(3-carboxy propionyl) lithocholate (I), 3-(3-carboxy propionyl) lithocholic acid (II), 3-acetyl lithocholic acid (III), 3-propionyl lithocholic acid (IV), 3-benzoyl lithocholic acid (V), 3-(4-nitrobenzoyl) lithocholic acid (VI), 3-cinnamoyl lithocholic acid (VII), methyl-3-(4-nitrobenzoyl) lithocholate (VIII) and 1,4-$bis$ [cholan-24-methoxy carbonyl-3-oxycarbonyl] butane (IX) were prepared in good yields and characterized by IR, NMR and polarizing optical microscopy. Compounds (I) and (IX) exhibited monotropic behaviour while the others were enantiotropic. Some of the compounds also showed a high tendency of super cooling. Compounds (V), (VI) and (IX) formed cholesteric phase while the remaining compounds displayed smectic phase.</p>

				<title>Anisotropic behaviour of semiconducting tin monosulphoselenide single crystals</title>
				<feature>Semiconductors</feature>
				<page>0569-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Single crystals of ternary mixed compounds of group IV–VI in the form of a series, SnS$_x$Se$_{1–x}$ (where $x$ = 0, 0$\cdot$25, 0$\cdot$50, 0$\cdot$75 and 1), have been grown using direct vapour transport technique. The grown crystals were characterized by the X-ray diffraction analysis for their structural parameter determination. All the grown crystals were found to be orthorhombic. The microstructure analysis of the grown crystals reveals their layered type growth mechanism. From the Hall effect measurements Hall mobility, Hall coefficient and carrier concentration were calculated with all crystals showing $p$-type nature. The d.c. electrical resistivity measurements perpendicular to $c$-axis (i.e. along the basal plane) in the temperature range 303–453 K were carried out for grown crystals using four-probe method. The d.c. electrical resistivity measurements parallel to $c$-axis (i.e. perpendicular to basal plane) in the temperature range 303–453 K were carried out for the same crystals. The electrical resistivity measurements showed an anisotropic behaviour of electrical resistivity for the grown crystals. The anisotropic behaviour and the effect of change in stoichiometric proportion of S and Se content on the electrical properties of single crystals of the series, SnS$_x$Se$_{1–x}$ (where $x$ = 0, 0$\cdot$25, 0$\cdot$50, 0$\cdot$75 and 1), is presented systematically.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>POM/graphite/Ekonol composites were prepared by the Torque Rheometer mixing and compression molding, and their hardness, compressive and impact strengths have been tested. The tribology behaviour was also investigated by the friction and wear experiment. The worn surface of the composite was studied by SEM technique, and on its basis, the wear mechanism was analysed. Results show that it was possible to prepare POM/graphite/Ekonol composites of high tribology performance and good mechanical properties by the Torque Rheometer mixing and compression molding. With the rise of Ekonol content, the wear mechanism was changed from adhesion plus plough to fatigue wear plus abrasive wear.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The sliding wear of isotactic polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and their blends was evaluated as a function of applied pressure and composition against a stainless steel counter face in dry condition. Wear rate decreases with the addition of PET in the blend. The wear was observed in two stages, the moderate wear and high wear while increasing the applied pressure on test samples. The addition of PET in PP helps in increasing the limit of moderate wear towards the high-pressure side. Microstructure and worn surfaces of samples were observed by scanning electron microscope. The wear phenomenon has been discussed based on wear losses and worn surfaces.</p>

				<title>Nanoindentation and AFM studies of PECVD DLC and reactively sputtered Ti containing carbon films</title>
				<feature>Tribological Materials</feature>
				<page>0585-0591</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amorphous carbon film, also known as DLC film, is a promising material for tribological application. It is noted that properties relevant to tribological application change significantly depending on the method of preparation of these films. These properties are also altered by the composition of the films. In view of this, the objective of the present work is to compare the nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy (AFM) study of diamond like carbon (DLC) film obtained by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) with the Ti containing amorphous carbon (Ti/$a$-C : H) film obtained by unbalanced magnetron sputter deposition (UMSD). Towards that purpose, DLC and Ti/$a$-C : H films are deposited on silicon substrate by PECVD and UMSD processes, respectively. The microstructural features and the mechanical properties of these films are evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoindentation and by AFM. The results show that the PECVD DLC film has a higher elastic modulus, hardness and roughness than the UMSD Ti/$a$-C : H film. It also has a lower pull off force than Ti containing amorphous carbon film.</p>

				<title>Material characterization of ancient Indian copper</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0593-0600</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A chalcolithic (2350–1800 BC) copper chisel from Balathal has been characterized by X-ray diffraction, microstructural and electrochemical methods. The surface patina was composed of sulfates and oxysulfates in the outer layers while the inner layers were rich in copper oxides. The chisel exhibited smaller grain sizes near two of the surfaces while the structure in the interior was equiaxed. The deformed grains and inclusions near the surfaces and variation in the microhardness of the sample from different faces proved that the copper chisel was processed by cold deformation after initial casting of the square cross-section chisel. The electrochemical behaviour of chalcolithic Cu has been compared with that of a modern Cu sample by potentiodynamic polarization studies. The corrosion rate of chalcolithic Cu in aerated 3$\cdot$5% NaCl solution was only marginally higher than that of modern Cu. The higher rate of corrosion has been attributed to the presence of second phase sulfide inclusions. The excellent condition of preservation of the 3800-year-old copper object, with no indications of stress corrosion cracking, suggests that pure copper or copper-based materials can be seriously considered as candidate canister materials for long-term underground storage of nuclear wastes in underground repositories.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports results of investigations carried out on a cast copper alloy containing 8 at.% Al. The alloy, and pure copper for the sake of comparison, were subjected to cold rolling with a final reduction of 30, 50 or 70%.</p>
					<p>The cold rolled copper and copper alloy samples were isochronally and isothermally annealed up to the recrystallization temperature. The hardness, strength and electrical conductivity were measured and X-ray and DSC analyses performed.</p>
					<p>Anneal hardening effect was observed in the alloy in the temperature range 180–300$^\circ $C, followed by an increase in the electrical conductivity. The amount of strengthening increases with increasing degree of prior cold work. The X-ray analysis shows a change in the lattice parameter during annealing when anneal hardening effect was observed. The DSC analysis shows the exothermic character of this effect.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reinforced concrete structures during their exploitation may be exposed to the common action of carbonation and chlorides causing corrosion of steel reinforcement. Therefore, the related data seem to be interesting and important when the evaluation of the service life of the structures is the object of interest. This fact was a motivation for the present experimental study on the sequence of action of chloride solutions and carbonation of the embedding concrete. The results obtained show that carbonation of concrete foregoing the action of chloride solutions may intensify the process of corrosion of steel reinforcement in comparison to the converse sequence of the action of mentioned media. At the same time the natrium chloride solution has been shown as a more aggressive medium opposite to the calcium and magnesium chloride solutions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Potentiodynamic polarization studies were carried out on virgin specimens of amorphous alloys Ti$_{48}$Cu$_{52}$, Ti$_{50}$Cu$_{50}$ and Ti$_{60}$Ni$_{40}$ in 0$\cdot$5 M HNO$_3$, 0$\cdot$5 M H$_2$SO$_4$ and 0$\cdot$5 M NaOH aqueous media at room temperature. The value of the corrosion current density ($I_{corr}$) was maximum for Ti$_{48}$Cu$_{52}$ alloy in all the three aqueous media as compared to the remaining two alloys. The value of $I_{corr}$ for the alloy Ti$_{48}$Cu$_{52}$ was maximum ($I_{corr}$ = 2$\cdot$6 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ A/cm$^2$) in 0$\cdot$5 M H$_2$SO$_4$ and minimum ($I_{corr}$ = 3$\cdot$5 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ A/cm$^2$) in 0$\cdot$5 M NaOH aqueous solutions. In contrast, the alloy Ti$_{60}$Ni$_{40}$ exhibited the least corrosion current density in 0$\cdot$5 M HNO$_3$ ($I_{corr}$ = 4$\cdot$0 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ A/cm$^2$) and in 0$\cdot$5 M NaOH ($I_{corr}$ = 5$\cdot$5 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ A/cm$^2$) aqueous media as compared to those for Ti–Cu alloys, while its value in 0$\cdot$5 M H$_2$SO$_4$ was comparable to that for Ti$_{50}$Cu$_{50}$. It is suggested that the alloy Ti$_{60}$Ni$_{40}$ is more corrosion resistant than the alloys Ti$_{48}$Cu$_{52}$ and Ti$_{50}$Cu$_{50}$ in all the three aqueous media.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The current ($I$)–voltage ($V$) characteristics of thermally evaporated CdSe thin films having thickness in the range 850–3000 Å and deposited within the substrate temperature of 303–573 K show nearly linear dependence at low voltage and afterwards a non-linear behaviour at higher voltage range. A detailed study of $I–V$ curves in dark and under illumination clearly reveals the mechanism as ohmic at low voltage and that of trap limited space charge limited conduction (SCLC) at higher voltage. The transition voltage ($V_t$) from ohmic to SCLC is found to be quite independent of ambient temperature as well as intensity of illumination. SCLC is explained on the basis of the exponential trap distribution in CdSe films. Trap depths estimated from the ln I vs 103/T plots are found to be within 0$\cdot$60–0$\cdot$37 eV. Using the relevant SCLC theory, the carrier concentration, $n_0$, total trap concentration, $N_t$, and the ratio of free charge to trapped charge, $\theta$ , have been calculated and correlated with ambient temperature and intensity of illumination.</p>

					<p>Pellets of ceramic, Na$_{1–x}$K$_x$NbO$_3$ ($x$ = 0, 0$\cdot$2 and 0$\cdot$5), were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction method. Prepared samples were characterized using XRD and SEM. The frequency and temperature variation of dielectric constant, loss tangent and dielectric conductivity of prepared samples were measured in the frequency range from 10 KHz–1 MHz, and in the temperature range from 50–250$^\circ $C for $x$ = 0$\cdot$2 and 0$\cdot$5,and between 50 and 480$^\circ $C for $x$ = 0 compositions. It was observed that the dielectric constant and loss tangent decrease, and conductivity increases with increasing frequency. Near the transition temperature the material shows anomalous behaviour for the observed properties, and the peaks of dielectric constant and loss tangent were observed shifting towards lower temperature with increasing frequency.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An important exercise in the study of rational approximants is to derive their metric, especially in relation to the corresponding quasicrystal or the underlying clusters. Kuo’s model has been the widely accepted model to calculate the metric of the decagonal approximants. Using an alternate model, the metric of the approximants and other complex structures with the icosahedral cluster are explained elsewhere. In this work a comparison is made between the two models bringing out their equivalence. Further, using the concept of average lattices, a modified model is proposed.</p>

					<p>Poly (1&amp;2)-aminonaphthalene and poly (aniline-co-1-aminonaphthalene) have been synthesized in high yields by chemical oxidative polymerization method. The polymers are soluble in polar solvents such as DMSO, NMP etc. In PNA-2 as head-to-tail coupling cannot occur, the electrical conductivity is lower than PNA-1. The copolymer exhibits distinct morphology, higher viscosity, characteristic exciton peak, appreciable thermal stability and electrical conductivity compared to PNA-1.</p>

				<page>0639-0642</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The optical transmission and absorption spectra in UV–VIS were recorded in the wavelength range 350–800 nm for different glass compositions in the system (CuO)$_x$(PbO)$_{50–x}$(Bi$_2$O$_3$)$_{50}$ ($x$ = 2$\cdot$5, 5$\cdot$0, 7$\cdot$5, 10$\cdot$0, 12$\cdot$5, 15$\cdot$0, 20$\cdot$0). Absorption coefficient ($\alpha$), optical energy gap ($E_{opt}$), refractive index ($n_D$), optical dielectric constant ($\varepsilon′_{\infty}$), measure of extent of band tailing ($\Delta E$), constant ($\beta$) and ratio of carrier concentration to the effective mass ($N/m^{\ast}$) have been reported. The effects of compositions of glasses on these parameters have been discussed. It has been indicated that a small compositional modification of the glasses lead to an important change in all the optical properties including non-linear behaviour. The optical parameters were found to be almost the same for different glasses in the same family.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Epitaxial layers of silicon are grown on single crystal Si-substrate from a solution of silicon in indium using conventional graphite slider boat technique. The important problems of natural convection due to lower density of silicon compared to indium, poor wetting of substrate due to high angle of contact of indium solution on silicon substrate resulting in poor nucleation, melt removal from the growth substrate and saturation wafer associated with LPE in this technique are practically eliminated using sandwich method with simple modifications of the boat and the method of growth. Some experimental studies on the effect of different surface preparations of growth substrate are also reported. Growth results are shown and discussed. Further, improvization of slider boat to facilitate better study of growth parameters is suggested in the line of modification already carried out.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ferrite particles coated with biocompatible phases can be used for hyperthermia treatment of cancer. We have synthesized substituted calcium hexaferrite, which is not stable on its own but is stabilized with small substitution of La. Hexaferrite of chemical composition (CaO)$_{0\cdot75}$(La$_2$O$_3$)$_{0\cdot20}$(Fe$_2$O$_3$)$_6$ was prepared using citrate gel method. Hydroxyapatite was prepared by precipitating it from aqueous solution of Ca(NO$_3$)$_2$ and (NH$_4$)2HPO$_4$ maintaining pH above 11. Four different methods were used for coating of hydroxyapatite on ferrite particles. SEM with EDX and X-ray diffraction analysis shows clear evidence of coating of hydroxy-apatite on ferrite particles. These coated ferrite particles exhibited coercive field up to 2 kOe, which could be made useful for hysteresis heating in hyperthermia. Studies by culturing BHK-21 cells and WBC over the samples show evidence of biocompatibility. SEM micrographs and cell counts give clear indication of cell growth on the surface of the sample. Finally coated ferrite particle was implanted in Kasaulli mouse to test its biocompatibility. The magnetic properties and biocompatibility studies show that these hydroxyapatite coated ferrites could be useful for hyperthermia.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple red-ox titrimetry method has been developed for rapid evaluation of the photo catalytic activity of TiO$_2$ based photo-catalysts. The analytical procedure employs monitoring the kinetics of a simple one electron transfer reduction reaction of conversion of Ce$^{4+}$ to Ce$^{3+}$ in dilute aqueous solution in presence of sunlight. The photo-catalytic activity of TiO$_2$ synthesized by two different routes was evaluated by the above technique. The effect of surface area, crystallite size and polymorphic contents on the photo-catalytic activity of TiO$_2$ was also studied employing this method.</p>

				<title>Electrochemical properties of tungsten oxysulphide thin films as positive electrodes for lithium microbatteries</title>
				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0673-0681</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several WO$_y$S$_z$ tungsten oxysulphide thin films were tested as positive electrodes for lithium microbatteries. The amorphous WO$_{1\cdot05}$S$_2$ thin film was found very promising. A capacity decrease occurred during the first few cycles, after which the films were able to intercalate reversibly up to 1$\cdot$1 lithium ion per formula unit under high regime (75 $\mu$A/cm$^2$). They were tested for 250 charge–discharge cycles, between 3$\cdot$0 V and 1$\cdot$2 V. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed on different compounds in both intercalated (Li$_1$WO$_{1\cdot05}$S$_2$, Li$_{2\cdot7}$WO$_{1\cdot05}$S$_2$ and Li$_{3\cdot8}$WO$_{1\cdot05}$S$_2$) and partially de-intercalated (Li$_1$WO$_{1\cdot05}$S$_2$) states in order to understand the redox processes occurring during the first discharge–charge cycle. The analysis of both the W4$f$ and the S2$p$ peaks has shown that the redox processes involve not only the tungsten atoms but also sulphur atoms. At the beginning of the intercalation, W$^{6+}$ was first partially reduced into W$^{5+}$, and then into W$^{4+}$, but the important stage was the reduction of W$^{4+}$ into W$^0$. In W$^0$, the electron binding energy was very close to that of metallic tungsten. At the same time, S$^{2-}_2$ ions were partially reduced into S$^{2-}$ ions. But only the reduction process of tungsten atoms appeared to be totally reversible.</p>

					<p>Unintentionally doped homoepitaxial InSb films have been grown by liquid phase epitaxy employing ramp cooling and step cooling growth modes. The effect of growth temperature, degree of supercooling and growth duration on the surface morphology and crystallinity were investigated. The major surface features of the grown film like terracing, inclusions, meniscus lines, etc are presented step-by-step and a variety of methods devised to overcome such undesirable features are described in sufficient detail. The optimization of growth parameters have led to the growth of smooth and continuous films. From the detailed morphological, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopic and Raman studies, a correlation between the surface morphology and crystallinity has been established.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The leaching rate of ${}^{60}$Co and ${}^{137}$Cs from the spent cation exchange resins in cement–bentonite matrix has been studied. The solidification matrix was a standard Portland cement mixed with 290–350 (kg/m$^3$) spent cation exchange resins, with or without 2–5% of bentonite clay. The leaching rates from the cement–bentonite matrix for ${}^{60}$Co: (4,2–7,0) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ (cm/d) and ${}^{137}$Cs: (3,2–6,6) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ (cm/d), after 125 days were measured. From the leaching data the apparent diffusivity of cobalt and cesium in cement–bentonite clay matrix with a waste load of 290–350 (kg/m$^3$) spent cation exchange resins, was measured for ${}^{60}$Co: (1,1–4,0) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ (cm$^2$/d) and ${}^{137}$Cs: (0,5–2,6) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ (cm$^2$/d), after 125 days. The results presented in this paper are part of the results obtained in a 20-year mortar and concrete testing project which will influence the design of radioactive waste management for a future Serbian radioactive waste disposal centre.</p>

				<page>0703-0706</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sintering of lime by double calcination process from natural limestone has been conducted with La$_2$O$_3$ and CeO$_2$ additive up to 4 wt.% in the temperature range 1500–1650$^\circ $C. The results show that the additives enhanced the densification and hydration resistance of sintered lime. Densification is achieved up to 98$\cdot$5% of the theoretical value with La$_2$O$_3$ and CeO$_2$ addition in lime. Grain growth is substantial when additives are incorporated in lime. The grain size of sintered CaO (1600$^\circ $C) with 4 wt.% La$_2$O$_3$ addition is 82 $\mu$m and that for CeO$_2$ addition is 50 $\mu$m. The grains of sintered CaO in presence of additive are angular with pores distributed throughout the matrix. EDX analysis shows that the solid solubility of La$_2$O$_3$ and CeO$_2$ in CaO grain is 2$\cdot$9 and 1$\cdot$7 weight %, respectively. The cell dimension of CaO lattice is 4$\cdot$803 Å. This value decreases with incorporation of La$_2$O$_3$ and CeO$_2$. The better hydration resistance of La$_2$O$_3$ added sintered lime compared to that of CeO$_2$ added one, is related to the bigger grain size of the lime in former case.</p>

				<title>Morphology and conductivity studies of a new solid polymer electrolyte: (PEG)$_x$LiClO$_4$</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0707-0714</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new solid polymer electrolyte, (PEG)$_x$LiClO$_4$, consisting of poly(ethylene)glycol of molecular weight 2000 and LiClO$_4$ was prepared and characterized using XRD, IR, SEM, DSC, NMR and impedance spectroscopy techniques. XRD and IR results show the formation of the polymer–salt complex. The samples with higher salt concentration are softer, less opaque and less smooth compared to the low salt concentration samples. DSC studies show an increase in the glass transition temperature and a decrease in the degree of crystallinity with increase in the salt concentration. Melting temperature of SPEs is lower than the pure PEG 2000. Room temperature ${}^1$H and ${}^7$Li NMR studies were also carried out for the (PEG)$_x$LiClO$_4$ system. The ${}^1$H linewidth decreases as salt concentration increases in a similar way to the decrease in the crystalline fraction and reaches a minimum at around $x$ = 46 and then increases. ${}^7$Li linewidth was found to decrease first and then to slightly increase after reaching a minimum at $x$ = 46 signifying the highest mobility of Li ions for this composition. Room temperature conductivity first increases with salt concentration and reaches a maximum value ($\sigma$ = 7$\cdot$3 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ S/cm) at $x$ = 46 and subsequently decreases. The temperature dependence of the conductivity can be fitted to the Arrhenius and the VTF equations in different temperature ranges. The ionic conductivity reaches a high value of $\sim$ 10$^{-4}$ S/cm close to the melting temperature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sodium aluminophosphate glasses having compositions of $x$Al$_2$O$_3$(1 – $x$)NaPO$_3$ ($x$ = 0$\cdot$05–0$\cdot$2) were prepared using conventional melt-quench technique. Density, glass transition temperature, microhardness (MH), thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and transmission characteristics were measured as a function of alumina content for different samples. They were found to depend on O/P ratio with pronounced changes taking place for O/P ratio $\geq$ 3$\cdot$5. Density, glass transition temperature and microhardness were found to increase up to 15 mol% of alumina and then they showed a decreasing trend. Thermal expansion coefficient decreased continuously with alumina content. Optical gaps for different glass samples as measured from transmission characteristics were found to be in the range 3$\cdot$13–3$\cdot$51 eV. It initially decreased with alumina content up to 15 mol% and then increased. The behaviour was explained on the basis of change in the average aluminum coordination number from six Al(6) to four Al(4) (i.e. Al(OP)$_6$/Al(OP)$_4$ ratio) along with the changes in polyhedra linkages in the glass network due to change in O/P ratio.</p>

				<title>Carbonization and demineralization of coals: A study by means of FT–IR spectroscopy</title>
				<feature>Carbon and Related Materials</feature>
				<page>0721-0732</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coal basically consists of two parts$—$a crystalline, inorganic part, and an amorphous, organic part. Based on this, we intended to study the changes that occurred on the composition and on the chemical structure of coals after carbonization at 1000 or 900$^\circ $C and demineralization treatments with hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. For this, four coals of different categories (or levels) were chosen: semianthracite (A–O) and high volatile bituminous coal (B–O), which are high level coals, and lignite (Li–O) and leonardite (Le–O), these being low level coals. The coals were first analysed in terms of their proximate and elemental compositions and then carbonized and demineralized. Also, the starting coals and the prepared samples were examined by infrared spectroscopy. In addition, a study of the optimization of the application of this technique for only A–O was carried out. For A–O and B–O, the spectra recorded intense absorption bands that are ascribable to vibration modes in mineral components as quartz and aluminosilicates, such as kaolinite. For Li–O and Le–O, the spectra displayed some other bands as well, also quite intense, which have been assigned to bond vibrations in functional groups and structures of their organic part. The carbonization of the coals resulted in significant changes in their inorganic part as the content of quartz increased and the content of aluminosilicates decreased. In addition, the thermal decomposition of mineral carbonates occurred. The carbonization greatly affects the organic part of the coals, especially in Li–O and Le–O, as most functional groups and structures are not thermally stable under heating conditions. With regard to demineralization, HF is a more effective agent than HCl, achieving products with higher organic content. The mass losses are higher in Li–O and Le–O than in A–O and B–O. So, the infrared spectroscopy allows the analysis of both inorganic and organic parts of the coals and of their carbonization and demineralization products. These processes facilitate subsequent analysis of the inorganic and organic parts of coals by infrared spectroscopy. In the application of this technique, both the coal:KBr ratio and the thickness for the disks should be controlled, owing to the influence on the infrared absorption.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>$In\ situ$ polymerization of aniline was carried out in the presence of fly ash (FA) to synthesize polyaniline/fly ash (PANI/FA) composites. The PANI/FA composites have been synthesized with various compositions (15, 20, 30 and 40 wt%) of FA in PANI. The composites, thus synthesized have been characterized by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The morphology of these samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Further the a.c. conductivity of these composites have been investigated in the frequency range 10$^2$–10$^6$ Hz. The presence of polarons and bipolarons are made responsible for frequency dependence of a.c. conductivity in these composites. The Cole–Cole plots indicate clear shift in the distribution of relaxation times as the wt% of FA in PANI changes. These composites show almost symmetric semicircles of Cole–Cole plots indicating the Debye-type relaxation in their polarization response.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Magnesium niobate (MgNb$_2$O$_6$) powder was synthesized by the conventional ceramic route as well as by the molten salt route using a eutectic mixture of NaCl–KCl as the salt and Mg(NO$_3$)$_2\cdot$6H$_2$O and TiO$_2$ as the starting materials. Pure phase of MgNb$_2$O$_6$ could be obtained by the molten salt method at 1100$^\circ $C. However, in ceramic method the pure phase of MgNb$_2$O$_6$ was obtained by heating at 1025$^\circ $C for 20 h. On sintering at 1100$^\circ $C the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of MgNb$_2$O$_6$ obtained by the molten salt method was found to be 19$\cdot$5 and 0$\cdot$004 at 100 kHz at room temperature. Lower values were obtained for these oxides prepared by the ceramic route, 16$\cdot$6 and 0$\cdot$000518, respectively. In both cases the dielectric constant was quite stable with frequency.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fretting fatigue is one of the most important phenomena for inducing a significant reduction of fatigue strength and consequently, leading to unexpected failure accidents of the engineering structures even at very low stresses. In the present study, both plain and fretting fatigue tests with zero mean stress were carried out on two different types of steel, low-carbon steel and martensitic stainless steel, by means of a reversed bending fatigue testing machine. The drop in the fatigue strengths through fretting at vise clamp–specimen interface were significant for both tested steels. The fretting processes produced a reduction in fatigue strength of about 27% for low-carbon steel and 16% for martensitic stainless steel.</p>

				<title>Theoretical approaches to superionic conductivity</title>
				<feature>Review--Ionic Conductros</feature>
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent theoretical approaches to the understanding of superionic conductivity in polycrystalline, glassy and polymeric materials are briefly reviewed. Phase transitions to the superionic conducting state in the AgI family are apparently triggered by cluster formation and strong mobile ion interaction within the clusters. Anomalous conductivity and related physical properties are explained in the cluster induced distortion model. Ionic composites such as AgX : Al$_2$O$_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br and I) involve conducting and non-conducting phases and the all-important interface between the two whose space charge enhances the conductivity and also trigger phase transitions to exotic polymorphic phases, for which the mechanisms are yet to be explored. Ion hopping dynamics controls the conductivity of superionic glasses. Mode coupling and jump relaxation theories account for the non-Debye relaxation observed in a.c. conductivity of these glasses. The theory of conductivity in polymer electrolytes$—$still in its infancy$—$involves their complex structure and glass transition behaviour. Preparative and thermal history, composition and crystallinity control ionic conductivity. New approaches to the synthesis of optimal polymer electrolytes such as rubbery electrolytes, crystalline polymers and nanocomposites must be considered before achieving a comprehensive theoretical understanding.</p>

The structural phase characterization was carried out using X-ray powder diffraction technique. It was found that the solid solution containing 20–40 mole% of Y$_2$O$_3$ had face-centred cubic structure. All samples of the solid solution series, (Bi$_2$O$_3$)$_{1–x}$ (Gd$_2$O$_3$)$_x$, had rhombohedral single phase in the concentration range 0$\cdot$10 $\leq x \leq$ 0$\cdot$40. Lattice parameters of $fcc$ phase of Y$_2$O$_3$ doped samples were calculated from the X-ray diffraction data. The lattice constant ‘$a$’ gradually decreases with increasing content of dopant concentration ($x$) for the Y$_2$O$_3$ doped system and obeys Vegard’s rule. The unit cell parameters for the (Bi$_2$O$_3$)$_{1–x}$ (Gd$_2$O$_3$)$_x$ doped samples showing rhombohedral phase were obtained on hexagonal setting.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The crystal structure of 3,3′-dimethoxybiphenyl has been determined by X-ray diffraction methods with an aim of describing the hydrogen interaction in biphenyl derivatives. The title compound crystallizes in monoclinic space group $P2_1/c$ with unit cell dimensions, $a$ = 7$\cdot$706(1), $b$ = 11$\cdot$745(2), $c$ = 12$\cdot$721(2) Å, $\beta$ = 92$\cdot$31(1)$^\circ $, $Z$ = 4 and its structure has been refined up to the reliability index of 3$\cdot$8%. The average torsion angle about the inter-ring C–C bond is 37$\cdot$5$^\circ $. The O1 and O1′ atoms of the methoxy group are deviated by 0$\cdot$046(1) Å and 0$\cdot$234(1) Å from the mean planes of respective rings. The crystal cohesion is pronounced due to three-inter-molecular C–H$\ldots$O hydrogen bonds.</p>

				<title>Nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy measurements on reactively sputtered TiN coatings</title>
				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0035-0041</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Titanium nitride (TiN) coatings were deposited by d.c. reactive magnetron sputtering process. The films were deposited on silicon (111) substrates at various process conditions, e.g. substrate bias voltage ($V_B$) and nitrogen partial pressure. Mechanical properties of the coatings were investigated by a nanoindentation technique. Force vs displacement curves generated during loading and unloading of a Berkovich diamond indenter were used to determine the hardness ($H$) and Young’s modulus ($Y$) of the films. Detailed investigations on the role of substrate bias and nitrogen partial pressure on the mechanical properties of the coatings are presented in this paper. Considerable improvement in the hardness was observed when negative bias voltage was increased from 100–250 V. Films deposited at |$V_B$| = 250 V exhibited hardness as high as 3300 kg/mm$^2$. This increase in hardness has been attributed to ion bombardment during the deposition. The ion bombardment considerably affects the microstructure of the coatings. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the coatings revealed fine-grained morphology for the films prepared at higher substrate bias voltage. The hardness of the coatings was found to increase with a decrease in nitrogen partial pressure.</p>

Addition of CoO leads to creation of oxygen vacancies and helps in sintering of SnO$_2$. Antimony oxide acts as a donor and increases the conductivity.

For enhancing stability and conductivity, MEEP–PEO : (LiX)$_n$ systems were prepared and conductivity measurements carried out. Further the MEEP/PEO : (LiX)$_n$ was doped with Al$_2$O$_3$ and TiO$_2$ nanocomposite ceramic fillers and the conductivity was studied. The conductivity vs temperature plots showed the enhancement of conductivity with TiO$_2$ added nanocomposite ceramic fillers.

				<page>0059-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The microstructure characterization by X-ray line profile analysis is possible for determination of dislocation density, micro-strain within grains due to dislocation and average coherent domain size (subgrain) within the grain. This study presents the X-ray diffraction peaks shape analysis and their broadening with different thermal treatments in Zr–2$\cdot$5% Nb pressure tube material. The peak shape is analysed using Fourier transformation and information about coherent domain size, micro-strain and dislocation density could be obtained from the Fourier coefficients of the peak. Analysis of broadening of the peaks by integral breadth method also gives the coherent domain size, dislocation density and micro-strain present in the material. The results from the X-ray techniques are comparable to those obtained from direct observation of transmission electron microscopy. The measured yield strength increases with dislocation density. An empirical relationship is obtained for the yield strength from the dislocation density of the material. The measured strength is in agreement with the one calculated from dislocation density.</p>

				<feature>Optical Materials</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Silicon based glass fibres are fabricated by conventional fibre drawing process. First, preform fabrication is carried out by means of conventional MCVD technique by using various dopants such as SiCl$_4$, GeCl$_4$, POCl$_3$, and FeCl$_3$. The chemicals are used in such a way that step index single mode fibre can be drawn. The fibre drawing process consists of various steps such as heating the preform at elevated temperature, diameter monitor, primary and secondary coating, and ultra violet radiation curing. The fibres are then characterized for their geometrical and optical properties. The drawn fibre has diameter of core and cladding to be 8$\cdot$3 $\mu$m and 124$\cdot$31 $\mu$m, respectively whereas non-circularity is found to be 4$\cdot$17% for core and 0$\cdot$26% for cladding as seen from phase plot. Mode field diameter is found to be 8$\cdot$9 $\mu$m and 9$\cdot$2 $\mu$m using Peterman II and Gaussian method, respectively. The fabricated fibres showed the signal attenuation of 0$\cdot$35 dB/km and 0$\cdot$20 dB/km for 1310 nm and 1550 nm, respectively as measured by the optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR).</p>

				<title>Simulation studies of atomic resolution X-ray holography</title>
				<feature>Simulation Studies</feature>
				<page>0079-0084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>X-ray holography is a new method of structure determination based on measurement of interference of a known reference wave with an unknown object wave (containing information on atomic sites scattering the reference wave) so that phase information is preserved. Unlike X-ray diffraction, it does not demand for translational periodicity in the material. It is based on the idea similar to that of optical holography and has been tested on crystals, quasicrystals, thin films and doped semiconductors for their structure determination. In order to analyse potentials and limitations of this technique, we have carried out theoretical simulation studies on simple structures. In this paper we describe the basic algorithm of hologram generation and reconstruction of atomic positions from generated data. We illustrate this technique using Fe ($bcc$) single crystal as sample case to demonstrate its capabilities and limitations. Simulations were carried out on the Cu ($fcc$) structure and on complex structure such as the Al–Pd–Mn quasicrystal. Technical issues such as low signal to noise ratio, twin image problem etc have been discussed briefly to emphasize the need for high intensity X-ray source such as synchrotron for experiments and proper reconstruction algorithm. Finally the scope and potential of this technique have been discussed.</p>

				<title>Deposition of metal chalcogenide thin films by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method</title>
				<feature>Review---Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0085-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During last three decades, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method, has emerged as one of the solution methods to deposit a variety of compound materials in thin film form. The SILAR method is inexpensive, simple and convenient for large area deposition. A variety of substrates such as insulators, semiconductors, metals and temperature sensitive substrates (like polyester) can be used since the deposition is carried out at or near to room temperature. As a low temperature process, it also avoids oxidation and corrosion of the substrate. The prime requisite for obtaining good quality thin film is the optimization of preparative provisos viz. concentration of the precursors, nature of complexing agent, pH of the precursor solutions and adsorption, reaction and rinsing time durations etc.</p>
					<p>In the present review article, we have described in detail, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method of metal chalcogenide thin films. An extensive survey of thin film materials prepared during past years is made to demonstrate the versatility of SILAR method. Their preparative parameters and structural, optical, electrical properties etc are described. Theoretical background necessary for the SILAR method is also discussed.</p>

				<title>Formation and characterization of Y:247 film through spray pyrolysis technique</title>
				<feature>Review---Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0113-0119</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The synthesis of high temperature superconducting films of Y:247 ($T_c \sim$ 73 K) have been successfully achieved. The difficulty in synthesis owing to narrow range of stability of Y:247 has been taken care of through several quenching modes, e.g. quenching of the films synthesized at $\sim$ 850$^\circ $C, in air or in liquid nitrogen. The energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of the as processed film, Y$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{14+x}$, exhibit nearly correct cationic stoichiometry of 2 : 4 : 7; also narrow regions ($\lt$ 50 Å) of minority Y:124 phase and stacking faults capable of working as flux pinning sites have been invariably found to be present. In addition to Y:247, Ag admixed films have also been investigated. The $T_c$ here is $\sim$ 70–75 K which is similar to that of the film without silver. Representative estimates of transport critical current density ($J_c$) for Y:247 films is $\sim$ 10$^3$ A/cm$^2$, and with silver corresponding to Y$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{14+x}$ (Ag$_{0\cdot1}$) is found to be $\sim$ 10$^4$ A/cm$^2$.</p>

				<title>Solid state synthesis and structural refinement of polycrystalline La$_x$Ca$_{1–x}$TiO$_3$ ceramic powder</title>
				<feature>Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0121-0126</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Perovskite structure based ceramic precursors have a characteristic property of substitution in the “A” site of the ABO$_3$ structure. This makes them a potential material for nuclear waste management in synthetic rock (SYNROC) technology. In order to simulate the mechanism of rare earth fixation in perovskite, La$_x$ Ca$_{1–x}$TiO$_3$ (where $x$ = 0$\cdot$05) has been synthesized through ceramic route by taking calculated quantities of oxides of Ca, Ti and La as starting materials. Solid state synthesis has been carried out by repeated pelletizing and sintering the finely powdered oxide mixture in a muffle furnace at 1050$^\circ $C. The ceramic phase has been characterized by its powder diffraction pattern. Step analysis data has been used to determine the structure of solid solution of lanthanum substituted calcium titanate. The SEM and EDAX analyses also confirm that the CaTiO$_3$ can act as a host for lanthanum. X-ray data has been interpreted using CRYSFIRE and POWDERCELL softwares. The $h, k, l$ values for different lattice planes have been generated from the experimental data. The lanthanum substituted perovskite crystallizes in orthorhombic symmetry with space group $P n m a$ (&#35;62). Following unit cell parameters have been calculated: $a$ = 5$\cdot$410, $b$ = 7$\cdot$631, $c$ = 5$\cdot$382. The calculated and observed values of corresponding intensities, 2$\theta$, and density show good agreement. GSAS based calculation for bond distances Ti–O, Ca–O, La–O and bond angles Ti–O–Ca, Ca–O–Ca, La–O–Ti have been reported.</p>

				<title>Finite element analysis of residual stress in the welded zone of a high strength steel</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0127-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The distribution of the residual stress in the weld joint of HQ130 grade high strength steel was investigated by means of finite element method (FEM) using ANSYS software. Welding was carried out using gas shielded arc welding with a heat input of 16 kJ/cm. The FEM analysis on the weld joint reveals that there is a stress gradient around the fusion zone of weld joint. The instantaneous residual stress on the weld surface goes up to 800 $\sim$ 1000 MPa and it is 500 $\sim$ 600 MPa, below the weld. The stress gradient near the fusion zone is higher than any other location in the surrounding area. This is attributed as one of the significant reasons for the development of cold cracks at the fusion zone in the high strength steel. In order to avoid such welding cracks, the thermal stress in the weld joint has to be minimized by controlling the weld heat input.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Porous hydroxyapatite ocular implant was fabricated by a novel and simple method using hydroxyapatite powder synthesized in the laboratory. The porosity and pore size of the implant were controlled to make it light in weight as well as suitable for rapid vascularization after implantation. The implant was characterized by X-ray diffraction studies, infrared spectra and chemical analysis for phase purity and chemical composition. The pore morphology and pore size distribution of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Thereafter, efficacy of the implant was examined by $in\ vivo$ study in dogs. Clinical, haematological and radiological studies indicated the suitability of the implant for replacement of the lost eye of human patients.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Strontium tartrate trihydrate (STT) crystals have been grown in silica hydrogel. Various polarization mechanisms such as atomic polarization of lattice, orientational polarization of dipoles and space charge polarization in the grown crystals have been understood using results of the measurements of dielectric constant ($\varepsilon'$) and dielectric loss (tan $\delta$) as functions of frequency and temperature. Ion core type polarization is seen in the temperature range 75–180$^\circ $C, and above 180$^\circ $C, there is interfacial polarization for relatively lower frequency range. One observes dielectric dispersion at lower frequency presumably due to domain wall relaxation.</p>

					<p>Ultra fine precursors for ferrofluid synthesis, belonging to the series, Ni$_x$Fe$_{1–x}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ (where ‘$x$’ varies from ‘0’ to ‘0$\cdot$6’ in steps of 0$\cdot$1), were synthesized. Ferrofluids based on these fine particles were prepared with oleic acid as surfactant and kerosene as carrier. Ferrofluidic thin films were made on glass substrates and magnetic field induced laser transmission was studied. The pattern exhibited by the films under the influence of a magnetic field was observed with the help of a CCD camera. The analysis of results confirms the chain formation of particles in the presence of an applied magnetic field and their saturation at higher applied fields.</p>

				<page>0169-0173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The magnetic properties of ball-milled TbFe$_2$ and TbFe$_2$B were studied by magnetization measurements. X-ray diffraction studies on TbFe$_2$B showed that boron occupied interstitial position in the crystal structure, just as hydrogen did. The value of the saturation magnetization of TbFe$_2$B was found to be smaller than that of TbFe$_2$. This is explained on the basis of a charge transfer between the boron atoms and the 3d band of Fe. The anisotropy of TbFe$_2$B was found to be large compared to that of TbFe$_2$. X-ray diffractograms for the ball milled samples showed that after 80 h of milling, a predominantly amorphous phase was obtained. TbFe$_2$B was found to undergo easy amorphization compared to TbFe$_2$. Magnetization of TbFe$_2$ was found to decrease rapidly with initial milling hours and was found to be constant with further hours of milling. TbFe$_2$B exhibited an anomalous behaviour with an increase in moment with milling hours and this may be due to the segregation of $\alpha$-Fe.</p>

One category represents prospective alkali activated cements. A significant factor influencing their properties is alkali activator used. In this paper we present a new high effective alkali activator prepared from silica fume and its effectiveness. According to the results obtained this activator seems to be more effective than currently used activators like natrium hydroxide, natrium carbonate, and water glass.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>15 wt% flyash (a calcined byproduct of thermal power plant) was incorporated in a normal triaxial kaolin–quartz–feldspar system by replacing equivalent amount of quartz. The differences in microstructural evolution on heating the compact mass of both normal and flyash-containing porcelain at different temperatures (1150–1300$^\circ $C) were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) operating in secondary electron image (SEI) mode. Microstructure of normal porcelain did not show the presence of mullite and quartz grains at 1200$^\circ $C and the viscosity of silica-rich glass restricted the growth of mullite crystals at 1250$^\circ $C. Flyash porcelain, on the other hand, shows the presence of primary mullite aggregates in the clay relict and a significant growth of mullite crystals in a low viscosity glassy matrix at 1200$^\circ $C itself. At 1300$^\circ $C, both the bodies show a larger region of more elongated ($\gt$ 1 $\mu$m) secondary mullite along with clusters of smaller sized primary mullite ($\lt$ 1 $\mu$m). Small primary mullite crystals in the clay relict can be distinguished from elongated secondary mullite crystals in the feldspar relict in their size. Primary mullite aggregates remain stable also at higher temperatures. XRD studies were carried out for quantitative estimation of quartz, mullite and glass, which supported the SEM observations. An attempt was also made to correlate their mechanical strength with the constituent phases.</p>

				<page>0189-0198</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lithium ion conductivity has been investigated in a boro-tellurite glass system, LiCl$\cdot$LiBO$_{2}\cdot$TeO$_{2}$.In the absence of LiCl, the conductivity increases with increasing non-bridging oxygen (NBO) concentration. LiCl addition has little influence on total conductivity although the observed barriers are low. Formation of LiCl clusters appears evident. In the a.c. conductivity and dielectric studies, it is observed that the conductivity mechanism remains the same in all compositions and at all temperatures. A suggestion is made that Li$^{+}$ ion transport may be driven by bridging oxygen $\leftrightarrow$ non-bridging oxygen (BO $\leftrightarrow$ NBO) switching, which is why the two different types of Li$^{+}$ ions in the clusters and in the neighbourhood of NBOs, do not manifest in the conductivity studies.</p>

				<page>0199-0205</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Elastic properties, ${}^{11}$B MAS–NMR and IR spectroscopic studies have been employed to study the structure of Na$_2$O–ZnO–B$_2$O$_3$ glasses. Sound velocities and elastic moduli such as longitudinal, Young’s, bulk and shear modulus have been measured at a frequency of 10 MHz as a function of ZnO concentration. Both sound velocities and elastic moduli increase with increasing ZnO concentration. Poisson’s ratio and Debye temperature were also found to increase with ZnO concentration. ${}^{11}$B MAS–NMR and IR spectra show characteristic features of borate network and compositional dependence trends as a function of Na$_2$O/ZnO concentration. The results are discussed in view of borate network and dual structural role of Zn$^{2+}$ ion into the network. The results indicate that the Zn$^{2+}$ ions are likely to occupy network forming positions in this glass system.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of a.c. conductivity behaviour of graphite filled polysulphide modified epoxy composites</title>
				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0227-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Composites of epoxy resin having different amounts of graphite particles have been prepared by solution casting method. Temperature dependence of dielectric constant, tan $\delta$ and a.c. conductivity was measured in the frequency range, 1–20 kHz, temperature range, 40–180$^\circ $C for 0$\cdot$99, 1$\cdot$96 and 2$\cdot$91 wt% graphite filled and unfilled epoxy composites. It was observed that the dielectric constant, tan $\delta$ and a.c. conductivity increase with increasing temperature. Near the transition temperature the materials show anomalous behaviour for the observed properties. Peaks of dielectric constant, tan $\delta$ and a.c. conductivity were observed to shift towards lower temperature with increasing frequency. Clear relaxation (tan $\delta$) peaks around 169$^\circ $C were observed in epoxy resin, which shifted to lower temperature side on increasing the frequency. Addition of 2$\cdot$91 wt% graphite shifted the tan $\delta$ peaks towards higher temperature side by creating hindrances to the rotation of polymer dipoles. Addition of 2$\cdot$91 wt% graphite leads to an increased relaxation time $\tau$ of dipoles in polysulphide epoxy from 1$\cdot$44 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$-3$\cdot$92 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ (s) at 90$^\circ $C by creating the hindrance to the rotation of dipoles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Cardanol, an excellent monomer for polymer production, has been isolated from CNSL and allowed to react with formaldehyde in a particular mole ratio in the presence of glutaric acid catalyst to give high-ortho novolac resin. Such characterized polyol has been condensed with diphenylmethane diisocyanate to produce rigid polyurethane. A commercially available polyol, polypropylene glycol-2000 (PPG-2000), has also been condensed with diphenylmethane diisocyanate and polyol to produce tough polyurethane. These polyurethanes were characterized with respect to their resistance to chemical reagents and mechanical properties such as tensile strength, percentage elongation, tear strength and hardness. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) were undertaken for thermal characterization.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Terpolymerization of 2-ethoxyethyl methacrylate (2-EOEMA), styrene (St) and maleic anhydride (Ma) initiated by benzoyl peroxide was carried out in acetone as common solvent for three monomers. The structure and composition of terpolymer were determined by FTIR spectroscopy by recording analytical absorption bands for St (3002 cm$^{-1}$), Ma (1781 cm$^{-1}$) and 2-EOEMA (1261 cm$^{-1}$) units, respectively. The reactivity ratios for the monomers were calculated according to the general copolymerization equations following the Finnemann–Ross and Kelen–Tudos models. The results show that terpolymerization were carried out through primary “complex” mechanism at near-binary copolymerization of [St...Ma] complex with 2-EOEMA. Structure of the resulting terpolymer illustrated by ${}^{1}$H-NMR and differential scanning calorimeter showed reduction in $T_{g}$ value.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work, tracking phenomena has been studied with HDPE material under a.c. voltage, with ammonium chloride as the contaminant. It is noticed that the tracking time depends on the conductivity and flow rate of the contaminant. The diffusion coefficient of the material was obtained. The thermal and chemical stability of the material were identified by carrying out a methodical experimental study. The physico-chemical analyses viz. wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), were carried out and it was concluded that the mechanism of tracking process is due to the surface degradation. The surface condition of the insulation structure was characterized for any surface discharges or tracking, using the leakage current measurement, utilizing the wavelet concepts.</p>

				<title>Electrical properties of ion irradiated polypropylene films</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0263-0267</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of high-energy (50 MeV) Li$^{3+}$ ion beam irradiation on polypropylene (PP) film has been studied in the fluence range 2$\cdot$4 $\times$ 10$^{12}$-1$\cdot$5 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ ions/cm$^{2}$. The a.c. electrical properties of PP films were measured in the frequency range from 0$\cdot$05–100 kHz, and at temperature range between 30 and 140$^\circ $C. This study indicates two peaks at 60$^\circ $C and 120$^\circ $C with comparatively high magnitudes. There is an exponential increase in conductivity with log of frequency and the effect is significant at higher fluences. The loss factor (tan $\delta$) vs frequency plot suggests that PP film based capacitors may be useful below 10 kHz. The capacitance is constant over a wide temperature range up to 130$^\circ $C. FTIR spectra of the PP films before and after irradiation indicate that intensity of C–H stretching vibration at 2900 cm$^{-1}$ is modified. The presence of many new peaks with the increase of fluence suggests the formation of alkanes and alkynes which might be responsible for the observed changes in the dielectric and electrical properties of PP films.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the presence of Al–O–Al linkages in an aluminosilicate glass where Si/Al = 1 by using 2D ${}^{17}$O triple quantum MAS NMR technique (3Q MASNMR). The experiments were performed at external magnetic fields of 8$\cdot$4 and 14$\cdot$4T. Despite ${}^{17}$OMAS NMR spectra of the sample in both fields do not give much information about the different kinds of linkages in the sample, 3Q MAS NMR spectrum shows clear evidence that there are some amounts of Al–O–Al linkages in the sample giving two completely resolved peaks. These two peaks were attributed to the Si–O–Al and Al–O–Al linkages on the basis of their chemical shifts and, quadrupolar coupling constants which are quite sensitive to the local structure.</p>

					<p>Optical absorption and fluorescence spectra of Eu$^{3+}$ ions in Al(NO$_3)_3$–SiO$_2$ sol–gel glass have been investigated using the Judd–Ofelt theory. JO intensity parameters ($\Omega_{\lambda}$) and subsequent radiative properties for ${}^{5}D_{0} \rightarrow {}^{7}F_{1,2,4,6}$ transitions are determined. The lifetime ($\tau_{r}$) of ${}^{5}D_{0}$ state is computed and along with JO parameters are compared with their corresponding values in other glasses prepared by conventional technique. A structural analysis, using IR and XRD spectra and non-linear parametrization of the silica gel glass is carried out. The study reveals the glass to be a very good third order non-linear amorphous optical material.</p>

				<page>0281-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Absorption characteristics of Cu$^{2+}$, Mn$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{3+}$ ions in ternary silicate (20Na$_2$O$\cdot$10RO$\cdot$70SiO$_2$, where R=Ca, Sr, Ba) glasses were investigated. The intensities of absorption bands due to Cu$^{2+}$ ion was found to increase with increasing ionic radii of the alkaline earth ions whereas it was found to decrease in case of Mn$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{3+}$ ions with increasing ionic radii of the alkaline earth ions. The results were discussed in the light of relation between linear extinction coefficients of these ions and coulombic force of alkaline earth ions. The change in intensities of Cu$^{2+}$, Mn$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{3+}$ ion is attributed due to change in silicate glass compositions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we discuss the synthesis of carbon–sulfur composite ($a$-C:S) films by vapour phase pyrolysis of maleic anhydride and sulfur. Structural changes in the system are analysed by scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. Microhardness test depicts an increase in the value of hardness with an increase in sulfur concentration. Electrical conductivity of composite samples varies with sulfur concentration. Magnetoresistance (MR) measurements show a drastic increase in the value of MR for the samples prepared at $\lt$ 900$^\circ $C. Thermal stability of these samples is analysed by thermogravimetric analysis, which depends on the host structure and the amount of intercalated species.</p>

				<page>0295-0301</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Transparent conducting tin oxide thin films have been prepared by electron beam evaporation and spray pyrolysis methods. Structural, optical and electrical properties were studied under different preparation conditions like substrate temperature, solution flow rate and rate of deposition. Resistivity of undoped evaporated films varied from 2$\cdot$65 $\times$ 10$^{-2} \Omega$-cm to 3$\cdot$57 $\times$ 10$^{-3} \Omega$-cm in the temperature range 150–200$^\circ $C. For undoped spray pyrolyzed films, the resistivity was observed to be in the range 1$\cdot$2 $\times$ 10$^{-1}$ to 1$\cdot$69 $\times$ 10$^{-2} \Omega$-cm in the temperature range 250–370$^\circ $C. Hall effect measurements indicated that the mobility as well as carrier concentration of evaporated films were greater than that of spray deposited films. The lowest resistivity for antimony doped tin oxide film was found to be 7$\cdot$74 $\times$ 10$^{-4} \Omega$-cm, which was deposited at 350$^\circ $C with 0$\cdot$26 g of SbCl$_3$ and 4 g of SnCl$_4$ (SbCl$_3$/SnCl$_4$ = 0$\cdot$065).</p>
					<p>Evaporated films were found to be amorphous in the temperature range up to 200$^\circ $C, whereas spray pyrolyzed films prepared at substrate temperature of 300–370$^\circ $C were polycrystalline. The morphology of tin oxide films was studied using SEM.</p>

					<p>The present study reports the effect of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, C$_{12}$H$_{25}$ OSO$_{3}$Na) upon the electrokinetic (electrophoretic mobility, zeta potential) and rheological (viscosity, yield value) properties of the Ca-bentonitic clay found in Turkey and its Na-activated form. The SDS dispersant was added in different concentrations in the range of 1 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$-5 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ mol/l. The results show that the viscosity and zeta potential values of bentonite dispersion are affected by the addition of anionic surfactant. The obtained data are analysed by considering the kind of exchangeable cations. Thixotropic property effect was observed in bentonite dispersions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Calcium tartrate single crystals were grown using silica gel as the growth medium. Calcium formate mixed with formic acid was taken as the supernatant solution. It was observed that the nucleation density was reduced and the size of the crystals was improved to a large extent compared to the conventional way of growing calcium tartrate crystals with calcium chloride. The role played by formate–formic acid on the growth of crystals is discussed. The grown crystals were characterized by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), microhardness measurement, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The results obtained are compared with the previous work.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The molecular and crystal structure of 2-aniline benzo(2,3-$b$) cyclopentane-1,3-dione has been determined by X-ray crystallographic techniques. This compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group $P2_{1}2_{1}2_{1}$ with unit cell parameters: $a$ = 5$\cdot$467(1), $b$ = 10$\cdot$657(3), $c$ = 19$\cdot$602(6) Å; $V$ = 1142$\cdot$01(5) Å$^{3}, Z$ = 4. The crystal structure has been resolved up to an $R$-factor 0$\cdot$050 for 1129 reflections. All the three rings in the structure are planar. However, the dihedral angle between the phenyl ring and the moiety comprising of a five-membered and six-membered ring is 92$\cdot$4$^\circ $. The oxygen atom O1 acts as a trifurcated acceptor and is involved in the formation of three intermolecular interactions.</p>

				<title>Corrosion behaviour, microstructure and phase transitions of Zn-based alloys</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0341-0345</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper is aimed at investigating the corrosion behaviour, microstructure and phase transitions of Zn-based alloys with different compositions. The corrosion tests are carried out both in acidic medium using 1 N HCl solution and in temperature dependence of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In the two different media, in particular, the corrosion behaviour of Zn-based alloys with respect to Al and Si contents is examined, and microstructure in acidic and TGA and phase transformations in TGA are also studied. Corrosion mechanism in TGA is also examined in terms of oxidation parameters and activation energies. The study reveals that corrosion behaviour of Zn-based alloys in acidic medium shows sometimes an increase and sometimes a decrease with time due to Al content which assists in delaying the corrosion by forming a oxide layer on the surface of Zn-based alloys. This property does not appear in temperature dependence of TGA. Further, Si content appears to remain in main matrix without being affected by acidic solution. On the other hand, it is observed that in microstructure, AlO(Al$_2$O$_3$), ZnO oxides and Zn–Cu phase precipitations are formed in main matrix, grain boundaries and partially inside the grains.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidation behaviour of the near $\alpha$-titanium alloy IMI 834 was investigated over a range of temperatures, from 600–800$^\circ $C, in air. Specimens were solution-treated in the $\alpha + \beta$ and $\beta$ phase fields for 1 h and 1/2 h, respectively and cooled in air to room temperature. The solution treated samples were subjected to stabilization treatment at 700$^\circ $C for 2 h, followed by cooling in air. Oxidation behaviour of these samples was studied from 600–800$^\circ $C in air, for 50 h. The morphology of the scales formed was examined by SEM and the phases present in the scales were characterized by X-ray diffraction. While there was little oxidation at 600$^\circ $C, the rate of oxidation increased at higher temperatures. In general, the rate of oxidation was found to be more in the $\alpha + \beta$ treated condition than that in the $\beta$ treated one. The results are discussed in terms of the characteristics of the oxide film formed under different conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The layered double hydroxide (LDH) of Zn with Cr on treatment with a hypochlorite solution releases chromate ions as a result of oxidative leaching by a dissolution–reprecipitation mechanism. The residue is found to be $\varepsilon$-Zn(OH)$_2$. The LDH of Mg with Cr on the other hand is resistant to oxidative leaching. In contrast, a X-ray amorphous gel of the coprecipitated hydroxides of Mg and Cr yields chromate ions. These results suggest that the oxidation potential of Cr(III) in LDHs is determined by the nature of the divalent ion and the crystallinity of the phase while being unaffected by the nature of the intercalated anions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nanocomposites with magnetic components possessing nanometric dimensions, lying in the range 1–10 nm, are found to be exhibiting superior physical properties with respect to their coarser sized counterparts. Magnetic nanocomposites based on gamma iron oxide embedded in a polymer matrix have been prepared and characterized. The behaviour of these samples at low temperatures have been studied using Mössbauer spectroscopy. Mössbauer studies indicate that the composites consist of very fine particles of $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ of which some amount exists in the superparamagnetic phase. The cycling of the preparative conditions were found to increase the amount of $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ in the matrix.</p>

On the other hand Yb$^{3+}$ : Er$^{3+}$ doped samples showed enhanced absorption due to ${}^{2}F_{7/2} \rightarrow {}^{2}F_{5/2}$ transition. The absorption and emission crosssection for ${}^{2}F_{7/2} \leftrightarrow {}^{2}F_{5/2}$ of Yb$^{3+}$ were estimated. FTIR absorption spectra have clearly shown the reduction of the absorption peak intensity with heat treatment in the range 3700–2900 cm$^{-1}$. The 960 cm$^{-1}$ band also showed progressive decrease in the absorption band peak intensity with heat treatment. The result of the investigations with essential discussions and conclusions have been reported in this paper.</p>

				<title>Effective thermal conductivity of real two-phase systems using resistor model with ellipsoidal inclusions</title>
				<feature>Thermal Properties</feature>
				<page>0373-0381</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A theoretical model has been developed for real two-phase system assuming linear flow of heat flux lines having ellipsoidal particles arranged in a three-dimensional cubic array. The arrangement has been divided into unit cells, each of which contains an ellipsoid. The resistor model has been applied to determine the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of the unit cell. To take account of random packing of the phases, non-uniform shape of the particles and non-linear flow of heat flux lines in real systems, incorporating an empirical correction factor in place of physical porosity modifies an expression for ETC. An effort is made to correlate it in terms of the ratio of thermal conductivities of the constituents and the physical porosity. Theoretical expression so obtained has been tested on a large number of samples cited in the literature and found that the values predicted are quite close to the experimental results. Comparison of our model with different models cited in the literature has also been made.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The presence of kidney stone in the kidney causes discomfort to patients. Hence, removal of such stones is important which is commonly done these days, non-destructively, with lithotripters without surgery. Commercially, lithotripters like extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripters (ESWL) made by Siemens etc are in routine use. These methods are very cumbersome and expensive. Treatment of the patients also takes comparatively more time because of more number of sittings. Some delicate nerves and fibres in the surrounding areas of the stones present in the kidney are also damaged by high ultrasonic intensity used in such systems. In the present work, enhancement of the kidney stone fragmentation by using ultrasound is studied. The cavitation bubbles are found to implode faster, with more disintegration efficiency of the lithotripters, which give better treatment to the patients.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of microstructural characteristics on fracture behaviour mechanism for electron beam welding of Ti–6Al–4V was investigated. The results indicated that the welded microstructure composed of coarse needle $\alpha + \beta$ phases presenting disordered and multidirectional short needle morphology to make fracture mechanism complex. The coarse grains in weld seam with microhardness 536 HV were easy to be fractured in the region where welding heat input was $\geq$ 68$\cdot$8 kJ/m. There exists flat curves of Ti, Al and V, Fe concentration distribution fluctuation to cause microstructural amplitude-modulated decomposition to increase the joint ductility and cleavage strength. The uneven distribution of the partial micropores located at the interior of the specimen acting as crack initiation sites lead to non-linear branch propagating path. The $\alpha + \beta$ interlaced structure results in the fracture location near $\alpha/\beta$ interface. The existence of stacking fault structure caused pile-up of dislocation to produce micropores to be new fracture initiation sites.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present work deals with the mixing of metal and silicon by swift heavy ions in high-energy range. Threshold value for the defect creation in metal Fe calculated was found to be $\sim$ 40 keV/nm. A thin film of Fe (10 nm) was deposited on Si (100) at a pressure of 4 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ Torr and was irradiated with 95 MeV Au ions. Irradiation was done at RT, to a dose of 10$^{13}$ ions/cm$^{2}$ and 1 pna current. The electronic energy loss was found to be 29$\cdot$23 keV/nm for 95 MeV Au ions in Fe using TRIM calculation. Compositional analysis of samples was done by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. Reflectivity studies were carried out on the pre-annealed and post-annealed samples to study irradiation effects. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction was done to study the interface. It was observed that ion beam mixing reactions at RT lead to mixing as a result of high electronic excitations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polycrystalline spherulitic crystals of pure Gd-heptamolybdate and single and twinned crystals of substituted Gd–Ba-molybdate were grown by using gel encapsulation technique. The thermal behaviour of these crystals was studied using the thermoanalytical techniques, which included TG, DTA and DSC. Thermal analysis suggests decomposition of the materials in one or more than one stages. Results obtained on application of TG based models viz. Horowitz–Metzger, Coats–Redfern and Piloyan–Novikova, are reported. According to the results of the kinetics of thermal decomposition, the random nucleation model is shown to be the one that is relevant to the decomposition of single rare earth (Gd) containing material and contracting sphere to the decomposition of the substituted (Gd–Ba) one. The kinetic parameters viz. the order of reaction, frequency factor and energy of activation using above-mentioned models, are computed and shown to bear reasonably good agreement.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An experimental study was conducted to observe the effects of parallel-superposed flow condition on viscoelastic properties of LLDPE, Kevlar fibre reinforced LLDPE and hybrid of short glass fibre and Kevlar fibre reinforced LLDPE. Parallel-plate rheometer was employed for these tests. Rheological parameters such as loss modulus ($G''$) and dynamic viscosity ($\eta'$) do not vary significantly on superposing steady state shear with oscillatory shear in the studied range of experiment at 185$^\circ $C in un-reinforced LLDPE. Kevlar fibre reinforced LLDPE and Kevlar/glass fibre reinforced LLDPE showed significant changes in the flow behaviour under various sets of superposed conditions. Storage modulus ($G'$), and $G''$ become highly sensitive to low oscillatory angular frequencies ($\omega$) under superposed conditions. These curves show two different regions with increased $\omega$ value. At low $\omega$ values, parameters $G'$ and $G''$ change sharply reaching a certain value, thereafter, changes are moderate with increased $\omega$. In case of $\eta'$ a maxima is observed, position of which, depends upon the value of steady shear rate. Maxima shifts towards higher frequencies with the increased steady shear rate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Investigation of solid solution of barium–strontium orthotitanates of the type, Ba$_{2–x}$Sr$_{x}$TiO$_{4}$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2$), show that pure phases exist only for the end members, Ba$_{2}$TiO$_{4}$ and Sr$_{2}$TiO$_{4}$, crystallizing in the $\beta$-K$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ and K$_{2}$NiF$_{4}$ structures, respectively. The intermediate compositions (till $x \leq 1$) lead to a biphasic mixture of two Ba$_{2}$TiO$_{4}$-type phases (probably through a spinodal decomposition) with decreasing lattice parameters, indicating Sr-substitution in both the phases. For $x \gt 1$, Sr$_{2}$TiO$_{4}$ along with a secondary phase is obtained. The dielectric constant and dielectric loss were found to decrease with Sr substitution till the nominal composition of $x$ = 1. However, pure Sr$_{2}$TiO$_{4}$ shows higher dielectric constant compared to the solid solution composition. Sr$_{2}$TiO$_{4}$ shows very high temperature stability of the dielectric constant.</p>

					<p>MgB$_{2}$ superconductor has been synthesized using a simple technique at ambient pressure. The synthesis was carried out in helium atmosphere over a wide range of temperatures. Magnesium was employed in excess to the stoichiometry to prevent the decomposition of MgB$_2$. Samples of MgB$_2$ thus prepared have been almost free from MgO as compared to other methods. Resistivities of the samples are quite low with residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of around 3. $T_{c}(R = 0)$ is 38$\cdot$2–38$\cdot$5 K with $\Delta T_{c}$ of 0$\cdot$6–1$\cdot$0 K.

				<abstract>
					<p>Temperature dependence of d.c. conductivity is studied in $a$-Se$_{75}$In$_{25–x}$Pb$_{x}$ thin films where $x$ is varied from 0–10. From these measurements, the values of the pre-exponential factor ($\sigma_{0}$) and activation energy ($\Delta E$) are calculated for each glassy alloy. An approximate linear dependence of ln $\sigma_{0}$ on $\Delta E$ is observed in this glassy system with good agreement between the expected and calculated $\sigma_{0}$ values using Meyer–Neldel rule. Linear dependence of ln $\sigma_{0}$ on $\Delta E$ in case of amorphous materials indicates that the conduction band tails a finite energy distance towards the valence band and Fermi level is controlled by fixed dominant hole levels deeper in the gap.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) thin films were grown on (100) and (111) Si substrates by CVD technique using hexamethyldisilane (HMDS) as the source material in a resistance heated furnace. HMDS was used as the single source for both Si and C though propane was available for the preliminary carbonization. For selective epitaxial growth, patterned Si (100) substrates were used. The effect of different growth parameters such as substrate orientation, growth temperature, precursor concentration, etc on growth was examined to improve the film quality. The surface morphology, microstructure and crystallinity of grown films were studied using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).</p>

				<page>0453-0457</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal spray coatings of surfaces with metal, alloy and ceramic materials for protection against corrosion, erosion and wear is an intense field of research. The technique involves injection of the powder into a plasma flame, melting, acceleration of the powder particles, impact and bonding with the substrate. Feedstock powders of metals, alloys and ceramics for thermal spray applications have to meet several requirements. Particle shape, size and its distribution, powder flow characteristics and density are the important factors to be considered in order to ensure high spray efficiency and better coating properties. For smooth and uniform feeding of powders into plasma jet, the powder particles have to be spherical in shape. High temperatures and steep temperatures present in thermal plasma is exploited to spheroidize particles in the present investigation. Nickel powder particles in the size range from 40–100 $\mu$m were spheroidized using plasma processing. SEM and optical micrographs showed spherical shape of processed particles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The study of ionic conductivity vs reciprocal temperature of pure KCl and KCl crystal doped with 0$\cdot$1, 0$\cdot$3 and 0$\cdot$5 mole% gadolinium has been carried out in as grown, quenched from elevated temperatures (100, 350 and 500$^\circ $C) and annealed at various timings i.e. 2–3 h and deformed by different percentages. The plots exhibit three well-known regions, II, III and IV (extrinsic regions). The intrinsic region I was not observed in the plots as the conductivity measurements were taken up to 575$^\circ $C. From the analysis of these plots, activation energies for the migration of cation vacancy and the association of gadolinium ion with cation vacancy in the lattice of KCl crystals are calculated. These values are compared with previously reported values. Further, an attempt is made to explain the existence of oxidation state of gadolinium ion in + 3 state rather than in + 2 state as reported earlier. The variation in conductivity with effect of concentration of impurity ion, quenching and annealing and deformation with various percentages are explained on the basis of formation of impurity vacancy dipoles, vacancy – vacancy pairs (which appear in the form of precipitation), storage of cation vacancies in the form of defects, introduction of fresh dislocations, etc.</p>

				<title>Biomimetic synthesis of cellular SiC based ceramics from plant precursor</title>
				<feature>Ionic Conductors</feature>
				<page>0467-0470</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A novel biomimetic approach in designing and fabricating engineering ceramic materials has gained much interest in recent times. Following this approach, synthesis has been made of dense Si–SiC duplex ceramic composites and highly porous SiC ceramics in the image of the morphological features inherent in the caudex stem of a local monocotyledonous plant. The process route involves making of a carbonaceous biopreform and its subsequent reaction with an infiltrating silicon melt to yield the biomorphic Si–SiC ceramic composites with flexural strength and Young’s modulus of 264 MPa and 247 Gpa, respectively and loss in weight of only $\sim$ 9% during oxidative heating up to 1200$^\circ $C in flowing air.</p>
					<p>The Si–SiC composites were transformed into porous (49 vol.%) SiC ceramics with complete preservation of microcellular anatomy of the parent plant, by depleting residual silicon phase in channel pores through reaction with carbon. SiC based materials so derived can be used in structural applications and in designing high temperature filters and catalyst supports.</p>

				<title>Accurate determination of the voltage of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) by $\langle$0 1 2$\rangle$  CBED–HOLZ analyses using GaAs crystal</title>
				<feature>Instrumentation</feature>
				<page>0471-0482</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) is a powerful technique to estimate lattice distortion and lattice strain in crystals. The positions of the higher-order Laue-zone (HOLZ) lines in the transmitted disc of CBED patterns are very sensitive to the lattice parameter, and can therefore be used to estimate changes in the lattice parameter. This offers the possibility to calculate lattice misfit and lattice strain. The positions of the HOLZ lines depend not only on the lattice parameter, but also on the operating voltage of the microscope. It is essential to know the actual voltage of the microscope. In the present work, (1 0 0) GaAs crystal has been used as a standard. Cross-sectional TEM specimens were prepared by argon ion beam thinning technique using a liquid nitrogen cold stage. $\langle$0 1 2$\rangle$ on-zone CBED technique has been used to estimate the actual voltage of the transmission electron microscope (Philips EM430T TEM), when the voltage was set at 250 kV. CBED–HOLZ simulation and analyses have been done, using JEMS software, to correlate with the experimental data. The methodologies adopted for estimating the actual voltage of TEM are discussed in this paper. The studies have also been cross-checked using $\langle$0 1 2$\rangle$ and $\langle$2 3 3$\rangle$ zone axes using (1 0 0) silicon standard. The techniques established are found to be suitable for TEMs operating at a setting voltage of about 250 kV. For the TEM studies, a regular double-tilt specimen holder is required in order to be able to get to the desired zone axes. When the experiments were repeated using a cryogenic double-tilt holder, an improvement in the sharpness of HOLZ lines was observed. Wherever possible, the use of the cryogenic double-tilt holder is recommended. Care must, however, be taken to ensure that effects such as lattice parameter changes (due to temperature changes), phase transformations etc can be properly accounted for.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO$_{2}$ by tartarate gel method</title>
				<feature>Nanomaterials</feature>
				<page>0487-0489</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A gel was formed when a mixture of TiOCl$_{2}$ and tartaric acid was heated on a water bath. Ultrafine powders of TiO$_{2}$ in the anatase phase were formed, when the gel was decomposed at 623 K and the mole ratio of tartaric acid to titanium was 2. The anatase phase was converted into rutile phase on annealing at higher temperatures, $\gt$ 773 K. When initial ratio of titanium to tartaric acid was $\lt$ 2, the decomposition of gel leads to the formation of mixed phases of rutile and anatase. However, pure rutile phase was not formed by the decomposition of gel for any ratio of tartaric acid and titanium. These powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and surface area measurements. The average particle size obtained for anatase phase was 3 nm whereas it was 30 nm for rutile phase. Raman scattering experiments were also performed to confirm both anatase and rutile phases.</p>

				<title>Silicon—a new substrate for GaN growth</title>
				<feature>Surface Studies</feature>
				<page>0501-0504</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Generally, GaN-based devices are grown on silicon carbide or sapphire substrates. But these substrates are costly and insulating in nature and also are not available in large diameter. Silicon can meet the requirements for a low cost and conducting substrate and will enable integration of optoelectronic or high power electronic devices with Si based electronics. But the main problem that hinders the rapid development of GaN devices based on silicon is the thermal mismatch of GaN and Si, which generates cracks. In 1998, the first MBE grown GaN based LED on Si was made and now the quality of material grown on silicon is comparable to that on sapphire substrate. It is only a question of time before Si based GaN devices appear on the market. This article is a review of the latest developments in GaN based devices on silicon.</p>

				<feature>Optical Properties</feature>
				<page>0505-0509</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In practice, the relative efficiencies of different crystals are often determined under identical conditions of temperature and excitation. If the temperature of a crystal is increased or decreased with respect to room temperature, luminescence efficiency may get increased or decreased according to the composition of the crystal. When coloured crystals of NaCl, NaBr, KCl and KBr are excited by pulse-induced excitation at different temperatures, the mechanoluminescence (ML) intensity increases with temperature. The ML intensity of first peak, $I_{ml}$, second peak, $I_{m2}$ and the total ML intensity, $I_{T}$, initially increase with temperature and then tend to attain an optimum value for a particular temperature of crystals. The ratio, $I_{m2}/I_{ml}$, is found to increase with increasing temperature of the crystals. The expression derived on the basis of rate equations, are able to explain the temperature dependence of ML intensity on several parameters.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Al–2Mg–11TiO$_{2}$ composite was successfully prepared by the conventional vortex method. The macrostructural observation revealed columnar structure with rutile particles being distributed throughout the matrix in the form of agglomerates. Microstructural observation showed the presence of micro voids in the particle-enriched zone. Electrical resistivity measurement showed a phase transformation at 360$^\circ $C, which was consistent during DSC studies due to the precipitation of TiAl$_{3}$ phase. As-cast composite was both hot rolled and cold rolled successfully to 50 and 40% reduction, respectively. The mechanical properties of the thermomechanically-worked composite were studied. From fractographic analysis, it was clear that the crack had nucleated at the particle/matrix interface and propagated through the matrix by microvoid coalescence. Ultimate tensile strength of cold worked composite was found to be better than the hot worked material.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An attempt has been made in the present work to prepare polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based proton conducting gel electrolytes in ammonium thiocyanate (NH$_{4}$SCN) solution and characterize them. DSC studies affirm the formation of gels along with the presence of partial complexes. The cole–cole plots exhibit maximum ionic conductivity (2$\cdot$58 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ S cm$^{-1}$) for gel samples containing 6 wt% of PVA. The conductivity of gel electrolytes exhibit liquid like nature at low polymer concentrations while the behaviour is seen to be affected by the formation of PVA–NH$_{4}$SCN complexes upon increase in polymer content beyond 5 wt%. Temperature dependence of ionic conductivity exhibits VTF behaviour.</p>

				<title>Functionalized polymer networks: synthesis of microporous polymers by frontal polymerization</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0529-0535</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA)–ethylene dimethacrylate (EGDM) copolymers of varying compositions were synthesized by free-radically triggered thermal frontal polymerization (FP) as well as by suspension polymerization (SP) using azobisisobutyronitrile [AIBN] as initiator. The two sets of copolymers were characterized by IR spectroscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry, for determination of epoxy number and specific surface area. Frontal polymerization was more efficient, yielding greater conversions at much shorter reaction times. The self-propagating frontal polymerization also generates microporous material with narrow pore size distribution. It yields higher internal pore volume and surface area than suspension polymerization, surface morphologies are, however, inferior.</p>

				<title>Role of tin as a reducing agent in iron containing heat absorbing soda–magnesia–lime–silica glass</title>
				<feature>Glasses and Ceramics</feature>
				<page>0537-0541</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The role of tin as a reducing agent in a 18Na$_{2}$O$\cdot$2MgO$\cdot$8CaO$\cdot$72SiO$_{2}$ glass containing a definite amount of total, $\Sigma$Fe = [Fe$^{2+}$] + [Fe$^{3+}$], was investigated with different concentrations of total tin, $\Sigma$Sn = [Sn$^{2+}$] + [Sn$^{4+}$], by absorption spectra of iron ions in the optical range 300–1200 nm recorded on a JASCO-7800 spectrophotometer. The single broad absorption band for Fe$^{2+}$ ion was marked at 1055 nm in the near infrared region and a narrow weak band for Fe$^{3+}$ ion at its $\lambda_{max}$ at around 380 nm was observed in the silicate glass. The proportion of ferrous iron was found to increase in the glass in the beginning with the addition of tin up to 0$\cdot$788% $\Sigma$Sn and then it approached a maxima with 1$\cdot$182% $\Sigma$Sn. Further addition of tin was found to be futile for the constant iron concentration of 0$\cdot$875% for achieving higher [Fe$^{2+}$]/[Fe$^{3+}$] ratio for maximum heat absorption due to Fe$^{2+}$ ion in the glass. The mechanism of the process was discussed on the basis of Sn$^{2+}$/Sn$^{4+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$/Fe$^{3+}$ mutual redox interaction in the molten glass at 1400$^\circ $C. The suitable limit of tin was suggested to be 0$\cdot$788 $\leq x \leq$ 1$\cdot$182% by wt for 0$\cdot$875% of total iron for getting maximum ferrous ion in the glass.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The activation energy plays a dominant role in deciding the utility of the material for the specific purpose—here storage. The dependence of the peak temperature of crystallization ($T_{p}$) on the composition and heating rate ($\beta$) has been studied here. From the heating rate dependence, $T_{p}$, the activation energy for crystallization ($E_{c}$) has been evaluated. The activation energy, $E_{c}$, calculated using three different approaches is found to decrease with the increase in Bi content. This analysis helps in finding the suitability of an alloy to be used in phase transition optical memories/switches. The results have been analysed using Kissinger’s equation for non-isothermal crystallization of materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polycrystalline sample of Pb$_{2}$Sb$_{3}$LaTi$_{5}$O$_{18}$, a member of tungsten–bronze (TB) family, was prepared using a high temperature solid-state reaction technique. XRD analysis indicated the formation of a singlephase orthorhombic structure. The dielectric studies revealed the diffuse phase transition and the transition temperature was found to be at 52$^\circ $C. Impedance plots were used as tools to analyse the sample behaviour as a function of frequency. Cole–Cole plots showed Debye relaxation. The activation energy was estimated to be 0$\cdot$634 eV from the temperature variation of d.c. conductivity. The nature of variation of d.c. conductivity with temperature suggested NTCR behaviour.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coal fly ash was used to synthesize X-type zeolite by alkali fusion followed by hydrothermal treatment. The synthesized zeolite was characterized using various techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, BET method for surface area measurement etc. The synthesis conditions were optimized to obtain highly crystalline zeolite with maximum BET surface area. The maximum surface area of the product was found to be 383 m$^{2}$/g with high purity. The crystallinity of the prepared zeolite was found to change with fusion temperature and a maximum value was obtained at 823 K. The cost of synthesized zeolite was estimated to be almost one-fifth of that of commercial 13X zeolite available in the market.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A sensor for ammonia gas and ethanol vapour has been fabricated using indium oxide thin film as sensing layer and indium tin oxide thin film encapsulated in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a miniature heater. For the fabrication of miniature heater indium tin oxide thin film was grown on special high temperature corning glass substrate by flash evaporation method. Gold was deposited on the film using thermal evaporation technique under high vacuum. The film was then annealed at 700 K for an hour. The thermocouple attached on sensing surface measures the appropriate operating temperature.</p>
					<p>The thin film gas sensor for ammonia was operated at different concentrations in the temperature range 323–493 K. At 473 K the sensitivity of the sensor was found to be saturate. The detrimental effect of humidity on ammonia sensing is removed by intermittent periodic heating of the sensor at the two temperatures 323K and 448 K, respectively. The indium oxide ethanol vapour sensor operated at fixed concentration of 400 ppm in the temperature range 293–393 K. Above 373 K, the sensor conductance was found to be saturate. With various thicknesses from 150–300 nm of indium oxide sensor there was no variation in the sensitivity measurements of ethanol vapour. The block diagram of circuits for detecting the ammonia gas and ethanol vapour has been included in this paper.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new crystal structure for $bis$(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene [(BEDT–TTF)$_{2}$ SbF$_{6}$] was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structure was refined in the $P \overline{1}$ space group at room temperature. Crystal data for new structure are as follows: triclinic, $a$ = 8$\cdot$670 (2) Å, $b$ = 8$\cdot$664 (2) Å, $c$ = 16$\cdot$842 (5) Å, $\alpha$ = 89$^\circ \cdot$29 (2), $\beta$ = 90$^\circ \cdot$71 (3), $\gamma$ = 92$^\circ \cdot$67 (1), $V$ = 1263$\cdot$64 Å${}^{3}, Z$ = 2, $D_{x}$ = 2$\cdot$136 g cm${}^{-3}$, (Mo–K$\alpha$), $\gamma$ = 0$\cdot$7107 Å, $R$ = 0$\cdot$057 for a total of 5517 independent reflections. The donors form a trimerized column, and the band structure calculated by the tight-binding approximation shows band insulator properties. The temperature dependent of the d.c. resistivity shows a semiconducting behaviour with room temperature resistivity along the $c$-axis; $\rho_{290 K}$ = 5$\cdot$6 ohm cm.</p>

					<p>SrS phosphors activated with Ce and Dy ions were prepared by solid-state diffusion method. Photoluminescent study was carried out on SrS : Ce, SrS : Dy and SrS : Dy, Ce. Thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance studies were also carried out on SrS : Dy phosphor. The thermoluminescence glow curve shows a peak at around 142$^\circ $C. Irradiated SrS : Dy exhibits an ESR line due to a defect centre. Thermal annealing behaviour indicates that this centre correlates with the TL peak at 142$^\circ $C. The centre is characterized by an isotropic $\text{g}$-value of 2$\cdot$0039 and is assigned to a $F^{+}$ centre.</p>

					<p>Seven samples of the polycrystalline, Ni$_{1\cdot25–x}$Zn$_{x}$Pb$_{0\cdot25}$Fe$_{1\cdot5}$O$_{4} (x$ = 0$\cdot$0, 0$\cdot$1, 0$\cdot$2, 0$\cdot$3, 0$\cdot$4, 0$\cdot$5 and 0$\cdot$6) ferrites, were prepared by usual double sintering ceramic method. X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples revealed single-phase cubic spinel structure. The magnetic properties were investigated by means of magnetization and a.c. susceptibility ($\chi$) measurements. A.C. susceptibility was measured from room temperature to the Curie temperature ($T_C$) of the samples. Variation of a.c. susceptibility ($\chi$) with temperature showed that the samples with $x$ = 0$\cdot$3 and 0$\cdot$5 contain single-domain (SD) particles whereas the samples with $x$ = 0$\cdot$4 and 0$\cdot$6 showed multi-domain (MD) nature. Values of Curie temperature ($T_C$) as obtained from the study of variation of a.c. susceptibility with temperature were found to decrease with increase in the Zn$^{2+}$ concentration ($x$). Magnetic measurements showed increase in magnetization as Zn$^{2+}$ content was increased from 0$\cdot$0 to 0$\cdot$5. Further increase in Zn$^{2+}$ content ($x$) reduces the magnetization.</p>

				<title>Preparation and study of thickness dependent electrical characteristics of zinc sulfide thin films</title>
				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0043-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc sulfide thin films have been deposited onto glass substrates by chemical bath deposition. The various deposition parameters such as volume of sulfide ion source, pH of bath, deposition time, temperature etc are optimized. Thin films of ZnS with different thicknesses of 76–332 nm were prepared by changing the deposition time from 6–20 h at 30$^\circ $C temperature. The effect of film thickness on structural and electrical properties was studied. The electrical resistivity was decreased from 1$\cdot$83 $\times$ 10$^{5} \Omega$-cm to 0$\cdot$363 $\times$ 10$^{5} \Omega$-cm as film thickness decreased from 332 nm to 76 nm. The structural and activation energy studies support this decrease in the resistivity due to improvement in crystallinity of the films which would increase the charge carrier mobility and decrease in defect levels with increase in the thickness.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thin films of Sm$_{2}$O$_{3}$ have been grown on Si(100) and fused quartz by low-pressure chemical vapour deposition using an adducted $\beta$-diketonate precursor. The films on quartz are cubic, with no preferred orientation at lower growth temperatures ($\sim$ 550$^\circ $C), while they grow with a strong (111) orientation as the temperature is raised (to 625$^\circ $C). On Si(100), highly oriented films of cubic Sm$_{2}$O$_{3}$ at 625$^\circ $C, and a mixture of monoclinic and cubic polymorphs of Sm$_{2}$O$_{3}$ at higher temperatures, are formed. Films grown on either substrate are very smooth and fine-grained. Infrared spectroscopic study reveals that films grown above 600$^\circ $C are free of carbon.</p>

				<title>Influence of $\beta$-cyclodextrin as an encapsule and as an inclusion complex dopant on conducting polyaniline</title>
				<feature>Conducting Polymers</feature>
				<page>0055-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An investigation on the effect of $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) in both free and inclusion-complexed forms with a guest anionic metal complex, dioxalatodiaquochromate(III) (DDC), on the characteristics of conducting 2–polyaniline (PANI) is carried out. Four materials, PANI (i.e. PANI–SO$_{4}$), PANI–DDC, PANI–CD and PANI–CD + DDC were prepared by $in\ situ$ chemical oxidative polymerization in aqueous H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ at pH 1 and subjected to electrical conductivity and spectral (IR and UV-$vis$) measurements. DDC and CD when separately incorporated, reduce the conductivity of PANI by about half whilst their inclusion complex CD + DDC enhances it. Spectral characterization reveals that DDC as a dopant and CD as an encapsule exhibit their effects through adverse interaction with imine–amine N centres and benzenoid moiety of PANI. The inclusion complex CD + DDC, on the contrary, functions as a dopant by lying in between the chains and seems to promote the extended conformation of PANI chain and hence the $\pi$-electron delocalization. Exposure of the material to methanol vapour causes a decrease in conductivity in PANI and PANI–CD while an increase in PANI–CD + DDC. This study makes explicit the distinct role of CD as an encapsule and CD + DDC inclusion complex as a dopant in altering the electrical property of PANI.</p>

				<title>Effect of Cr and Ni on diffusion bonding of Fe$_{3}$Al with steel</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Microstructure at the diffusion bonding interface between Fe$_{3}$Al and steel including Q235 low carbon steel and Cr18–Ni8 stainless steel was analysed and compared by means of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The effect of Cr and Ni on microstructure at the Fe$_{3}$Al/steel diffusion bonding interface was discussed. The experimental results indicate that it is favourable for the diffusion of Cr and Ni at the interface to accelerate combination of Fe$_{3}$Al and steel during bonding. Therefore, the width of Fe$_{3}$Al/Cr18–Ni8 interface transition zone is more than that of Fe$_{3}$Al/Q235. And Fe3Al dislocation couples with different distances, even dislocation net occurs at the Fe$_{3}$Al/Cr18–Ni8 interface because of the dispersive distribution of Cr and Ni in Fe$_{3}$Al phase.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The distribution of elements near the Fe$_{3}$Al/Q235 diffusion bonding interface was computed by the diffusion equation as well as measured by means of EPMA. The results indicated close agreement between the two for iron and aluminium. Diffusion coefficient in the interface transition zone is larger than that in the Fe$_{3}$Al and Q235 steel at the same temperature, which is favourable to elemental diffusion. The diffusion distance near the Fe$_{3}$Al/Q235 interface increased with increasing heating temperature, $T$, and the holding time, $t$. The relation between the width of the interface transition zone, $x$, and the holding time, $t$, conformed to parabolic growth law: $x^{2}$ = 4$\cdot$8 $\times$ 10$^{4}$ exp(– 133/RT) ($t – t_{0}$). The width of the interface transition zone does not increase significantly for holding times beyond 60 min.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of the paper is to study the effect of ageing, inclusions and voids on the mechanism of fracture and resultant toughness. It has been found that the voids are initiated at only a fraction of the larger inclusions present. The initiation of voids at small particles in the ductile fracture process appears to have little effect on fracture toughness. The strain hardening capacity has a marked effect on void size, and is an indicator of fracture toughness in the commercial Al alloy.</p>

The effect of cooling rate was investigated. It was observed that fast cooled sample exhibited regular overlapping of stacking faults and $\varepsilon$ martensite plates were formed parallel to each other. TEM investigations showed that the orientation relationship between $\gamma$–$\varepsilon$ phases corresponds to Shoji–Nishiyama type orientation relationship.</p>

				<page>0091-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fatigue behaviour of 2014 Al-alloy has been studied in various thermomechanically aged conditions. It is observed that fatigue properties can be improved by a thermomechanical treatment, which would reduce the concentrations of dispersoids, provide a relatively uniform deformation structure and produce fine distribution of $\theta'$ precipitates. Fine $\theta'$ particles inhibit dynamic recovery and produce uniform deformation structure, which improves fatigue behaviour. Presence of dispersoids and coarse precipitate particles leads to the formation of persistent slip bands (PSBs) and a highly heterogeneous deformation structure, which cause damage to fatigue properties.</p>

				<title>Dispersion and rheological studies of Y–PSZ tape casting slurry</title>
				<feature>Ceramics and Glasses</feature>
				<page>0103-0108</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Different solvent systems in combination with three different dispersants were tried to find out the suitable solvent–dispersant combination, which give optimum dispersion of PSZ. Based on sedimentation, viscosity and rheology characteristics, zeotropic ethanol : xylene with a ratio of 50 : 50 along with 0$\cdot$5 wt% phosphate ester was found to be the best solvent and dispersant combination. Optimized tape casting slurry was prepared using PEG 600 and BBP as plasticizers and PVB as the binder. Cyclohexanone was used as the homogenizer. The optimized slurry composition with 58% solid loading exhibited shear-thinning pseudoplastic rheological behaviour. Y–PSZ tapes of $\sim$ 50 $\mu$m thickness free from visible defects were cast with a green tape density of 55%.</p>

				<title>Role of dispersion conditions on grindability of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powders</title>
				<feature>Ceramics and Glasses</feature>
				<page>0109-0114</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A precursor for zirconia – 8 mole% yttria (YSZ–ZrO$_{2}$–8 m% Y$_{2}$O$_{3}$) powder was prepared by coprecipitation and the calcination temperature was fixed as 900$^\circ $C from TG–DTA and XRD studies. The calcined powder could be dry ground only to a mean particle size ($D_{50}$) of 6 $\mu$m containing substantial amount of coarse agglomerates in the size range 10–100 $\mu$m. The dispersion conditions for its wet grinding were evaluated through zeta-potential and viscosity studies. The zeta-potential variation with pH of the aqueous suspensions of the powder exhibited maximum numerical values at 3 and 11 pH, exhibiting the ideal pHs for dispersion stability through electrostatic columbic repulsion mechanism. Slurries of dry ground powders with solid concentration in the range 15–30 vol.% exhibited pseudo-plastic flow characteristics, indicating presence of flocculates. With progress of grinding, the increase in viscosity of the slurries became less significant with decreasing solid concentration. Even though the particle size of the ground slurries decreased with decreasing solid content, there was little change in it for slurries with solid content $\lt$ 20 vol.%. Grinding conditions for formation of sinter-active powders of YSZ with sub-micron size ($D_{50}\ \sim$0$\cdot$7 $\mu$m free of agglomerates of size $\gt$ 5 $\mu$m) were established. Compacts from this powder could be sintered at 1400$^\circ $C to translucent bodies with 99% theoretical density.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Stoichiometric hydroxyapatite with Ca/P molar ratio, 1$\cdot$67, was synthesized using hen’s eggshell as calcium source and phosphoric acid by precipitation method. Conventional EDTA titration and gravimetric methods were adopted to estimate the amount of calcium and phosphorous, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared (FT–IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were employed to investigate the formation of the HAP phase. Thermal analysis (TG–DTA) was carried out to investigate the thermal stability of HAP powder. FT–IR spectra show the characteristic peaks for phosphate and hydroxyl groups. XRD results reveal that the major characteristic peaks of HAP appear in the region of approximately 26$^\circ $, 28$^\circ $, 29$^\circ $, 30–35$^\circ $, 39$^\circ $, 46$^\circ $, 49$^\circ $ and 50$^\circ $ (2$\theta$) and also indicate that there are no occurrences of secondary phases during HAP formation. TG–DTA result depicts that the synthesized HAP was stable up to 1300$^\circ $C.</p>

					<p>A gel was formed when a aqueous solution of BaCl$_{2}$, NbF$_{5}$ and citric acid in stoichiometric ratio is heated on a water bath. This gel on decomposition at 600$^\circ $C yielded the nano crystallites of BaNb$_{2}$O$_{6}$, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction study (XRD). This is a much lower temperature as compared to that prepared by traditional solid state method (1000$^\circ $C) as reported for the formation of BaNb$_{2}$O$_{6}$. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) investigations revealed that the average particle size is 50 nm for the calcined powders.

				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0125-0130</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Al–SiC$_{p}$ composites have been synthesized by spray forming process with variation in particle flow rate, size of reinforcement particles and their volume fraction. The microstructure of composites and their electrical conductivity have been investigated. The results showed a uniform dispersion of large size particulate phase in the matrix of the primary $\alpha$-phase with its equiaxed grain morphology. However, clustering of small size particles was observed at the grain boundary and grain junctions. The grain size of the composite materials was observed to be lower than that of the base Al-alloy. The composite materials invariably indicated their lower electrical conductivity compared to that of the monolithic Al-alloy. The electrical conductivity of composites decreased with increase in the volume fraction and decrease in size of the reinforcement particles. A high flow rate of particles during spray deposition resulted in a decrease in its conductivity. These results are explained in the light of thermal mismatch between the matrix and the reinforcement phases resulting in generation of high dislocation density. The droplet-particle interaction and resulting microstructure evolution during the spray deposition of the composites are discussed.</p>

				<title>Some studies on the reaction between fly ash and lime</title>
				<feature>Fly Ash</feature>
				<page>0131-0136</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction between fly ash (FA) and lime is extensively exploited for the manufacture of building bricks, blocks and aggregates. To get a better idea of this reaction, FA from different sources were mixed in different ratios with lime and compacted. The compacts were treated both by ordinary water and hydrothermal curing to promote lime bearing hydrate bond formation e.g. CaO–SiO$_{2}$–H$_{2}$O (C–S–H), CaO–Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$–H$_{2}$O (C–A–H) etc. The decrease in free lime content in these compacts was measured as a function of curing time and curing process. This drop in this content was correlated to the chemical composition of the fly ashes. The mathematical relationships between free lime remaining in the compacts after its maximum decrease in concentration and lime binding modulus (a ratio between the amount of added lime and the total amount of lime binding constituents present in FA) for both types of curing were developed. Further, the rate of decrease in free CaO content under both types of curing conditions was compared from kinetic study. From this study the orders of the reactions and rate constants were found out.</p>

					<p>New hybrid inorgano–organic materials were synthesized by anchoring organic moieties, ortho chlorophenol and para chlorophenol onto metal (IV) tungstates viz. tin tungstate (SnW), titanium tungstate (TiW) and zirconium tungstate (ZW) to give SnWoCP, SnWpCP, TiWoCP, TiWpCP, ZWoCP and ZWpCP, respectively. The materials were characterized for elemental analysis, thermal analysis (TGA, DSC), X-ray analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. Chemical resistivity of these materials were assessed in several acidic, basic and organic media. Further, the study of transport properties of these materials has been explored by measuring proton conductivity at different temperatures in the range 30–175$^\circ $C using HP4192A impedance analyser over a frequency range 5 Hz–13 MHz at a signal level below 1 V. Based on the specific conductance data and Arrhenius plots, a suitable mechanism was proposed and conductance performance of derivatized and nonderivatized materials compared.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Layered double hydroxides (LDH) with brucite like structure was modified with various anionic surfactants containing sulfonate, carboxyl, phosphonate and sulfate end group through ion-exchange method. XRD reports indicated that the sulfonate group containing surfactants led to an adsorption process whereas the sulfate, carboxyl and phosphonate group containing surfactant led to an intercalation process. This can be evidenced from the change in basal spacing of LDH. The presence of anionic surfactants in the LDH was supported by FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectrum indicated that complete removal of carbonate anion from the inter layer space of LDH is very difficult. The phosphonate intercalated HT showed less thermal stability than pristine LDH.</p>

In the present investigation, Tl–Ca–Ba–Cu–O superconducting films have been prepared on YSZ (100) and MgO (100) single crystal substrates via precursor route followed by thallination. The post deposition heat treatments of the precursor films were carried out for various annealing temperatures (870$^\circ $C, 890$^\circ $C) and durations (1 and 2 min). The optimized thallination procedure occurred at 870$^\circ $C for 2 min into good quality films with Tc ($R$ = 0) $\sim$ 103 K for YSZ and $T_{c}(R$ = 0) $\sim$ 98 K for M$\text{g}$O substrates, respectively.

				<title>Superconductivity and electrical resistivity in alkali metal doped fullerides: Phonon mechanism</title>
				<feature>Superconductors</feature>
				<page>0155-0171</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We consider a two-peak model for the phonon density of states to investigate the nature of electron pairing mechanism for superconducting state in fullerides. We first study the intercage interactions between the adjacent C$_{60}$ cages and expansion of lattice due to the intercalation of alkali atoms based on the spring model to estimate phonon frequencies from the dynamical matrix for the intermolecular alkali-C$_{60}$ phonons. Electronic parameter as repulsive parameter and the attractive coupling strength are obtained within the random phase approximation. Transition temperature, $T_{c}$, is obtained in a situation when the free electrons in lowest molecular orbital are coupled with alkali-C$_{60}$ phonons as 5 K, which is much lower as compared to reported $T_{c} (\approx$ 20 K). The superconducting pairing is mainly driven by the high frequency intramolecular phonons and their effects enhance it to 22 K. To illustrate the usefulness of the above approach, the carbon isotope exponent and the pressure effect are also estimated. Temperature dependence of electrical resistivity is then analysed within the same model phonon spectrum. It is inferred from the two-peak model for phonon density of states that high frequency intramolecular phonon modes play a major role in pairing mechanism with possibly some contribution from alkali-C$_{60}$ phonon to describe most of the superconducting and normal state properties of doped fullerides.</p>

				<title>Estimation of CE–CVM energy parameters from miscibility gap data</title>
				<feature>Modelling Studies</feature>
				<page>0173-0177</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The powerful framework of cluster expansion–cluster variation methods (CE–CVM) expresses alloy free energy in terms of energy (model) parameters, macroscopic variables (composition and temperature) and microscopic variables (correlation functions). A simultaneous optimization of thermodynamic and phase equilibria data using CE–CVM is critically dependent on giving good initial values of energy parameters, macroscopic and microscopic variables, respectively. No standard method for obtaining the initial values of the energy parameters is available in literature. As a starting point, a method has been devised to estimate the values of energy parameters from consolute point (miscibility gap maximum) data. Empirical relations among energy parameters, temperature ($T_{c}$), composition ($x_{c}$) and $d^{2}T/dx^{2}$ at the consolute point, have been developed using CE–CVM free energy functions for $bcc$ and $fcc$ structures in the tetrahedron and tetrahedron–octahedron approximations, respectively. Thus from the observed data of $T_{c}, x_{c}$ and $d^{2}T/dx^{2}$ in the above relations, good initial values of energy parameters can be obtained. Further, a necessary modification to the classical NR method for solving simultaneous nonlinear/transcendental equations with a double root in one variable and a simple root in the other has been presented.</p>

The liquid solution model contains thirtyseven parameters. Twentyfour of them pertain to those of the six constituent binaries, twelve refer to the specific ternary interactions. Additionally the liquid solution model also contains a specific quaternary interaction parameter. The latter has been evaluated here based on the experimental data available in the literature. The present research shows an excellent agreement between the derived and experimental values at 1173 K and 1273 K for the system. The article also presents a comparison between the evaluated values with those based on the regular solution model for the liquid alloys.</p>

				<title>Weak C–H$\ldots$O hydrogen bonds in alkaloids: An overview</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0187-0198</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An overview of general classification scheme, medicinal importance and crystal structure analysis with emphasis on the role of hydrogen bonding in some alkaloids is presented in this paper. The article is based on a general kind of survey while crystallographic analysis and role of hydrogen bonding are limited to only those alkaloids whose three-dimensional structure has been reported by us. The C–H$\ldots$O hydrogen bonding in the solid state in alkaloids has been found to be predominant and this observation makes the role of hydrogen bonding in organic molecular assemblies very important.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two-stage columbite solid state reaction route has been used for the preparation of Pb (B$'_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$ materials (B$'$ = Mg, Ni and Cd). The columbite precursor phase was structurally characterized using diffraction data. MgNb$_{2}$O$_{6}$, NiNb$_{2}$O$_{6}$ and CdNb$_{2}$O$_{6}$ show orthorhombic structures i.e. pure columbite phase. Final phase materials get stabilized in mixed phase. The diffraction pattern shows that it is a mixture of cubic pyrochlore and perovskite phase. Percentage of perovskite phase was calculated using the band intensities of (110) perovskite and (222) pyrochlore peaks. The calculated percentages show the dominant perovskite phase. Possible reasons for mixed phase are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>High purity fine silver powder with uniform particle morphology was prepared through glycerol process. The process involves reduction of silver nitrate by glycerol under atmospheric conditions at a temperature below 175$^\circ $C. Glycerol, in this process, acts as a solvent as well as a reducing agent. The powders prepared through this process were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and chemical analysis. The powders were well crystalline and contained oxygen, carbon and hydrogen as impurities. Overall purity was better than 99$\cdot$9%. The yield of silver powder was better than 99%.</p>

				<title>Optical and microstructural investigations of porous silicon</title>
				<feature>Porous Silicon</feature>
				<page>0219-0225</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Raman scattering and photoluminescence (PL) measurements on (100) oriented $n$-type crystalline silicon ($c$-Si) and porous silicon (PS) samples were carried out. PS samples were prepared by anodic etching of $c$-Si under the illumination of light for different etching times of 30, 60 and 90 min. Raman scattering from the optical phonon in PS showed the redshift of the phonon frequency, broadening and increased asymmetry of the Raman mode on increasing the etching time. Using the phonon confinement model, the average diameter of Si nanocrystallites has been estimated as 2$\cdot$9, 2$\cdot$6 and 2$\cdot$3 nm for 30, 60 and 90 min samples, respectively. Similar size of Si crystallites has been confirmed from the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Using 2TO phonon mode intensity, we conjectured that the disordered Si region around the pores present in 30 min PS dissolved on etching for 90 min. The photoluminescence (PL) from PS increased in intensity and blue shifted with etching time from 2$\cdot$1–2$\cdot$3 eV. Blue shifting of PL is consistent with quantum confinement of electron in Si nanocrystallites and their sizes are estimated as 2$\cdot$4, 2$\cdot$3 and 2$\cdot$1 nm for 30, 60 and 90 min PS, respectively which are smaller than the Raman estimated sizes due to temperature effect. Unambiguous dominance of quantum confinement effect is reported in these PS samples.</p>

					<p>Using photo acoustic technique, the thermal properties of CdS thin films grown by spray pyrolysis are measured. Thermal diffusivity and conductivity in these films decrease at least two orders compared with bulk. These results are compared with our study on nano CdS and the other available literature. The comparison is good. The dependence of thermal diffusivity on the thickness of the layer or the size of the particles on the glass substrate are analysed from the present measurement and discussed.

				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of anions like Cl$^{–}$, Br$^{–}$, NO$^{–}_{3}$ and SO$^{2-}_{4}$ on the anodic dissolution of the monolithic Al 6061 alloy have been investigated at neutral pH through immersion testing and electrochemical techniques like potentiodynamic polarization and a.c. impedance spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to characterize the corroded surface and to observe the extent of pitting in different media. From the evaluated corrosion parameters it was found that the dissolution of the matrix was extensively reduced in presence of aqueous solutions containing Br$^{–}$, NO$^{–}_{3}$ and SO$^{2-}_{4}$ ions while Cl$^{–}$ ions aggravated corrosion by penetrating into the barrier oxide film on the surface of the material. Pronounced effect of pitting was observed in presence of Cl$^{–}$ and the level of pitting in NO$^{–}_{3}$ and Br$^{–}$ were mild. In presence of SO$^{2-}_{4}$ ions passivity was extended over a wide potential range and breakdown of passivity occurs when the material was polarized beyond pitting potential. The departure of capacitive behaviour towards resistive behaviour was clearly observed through impedance measurements when investigations were conducted in Cl$^{–}$ media and in presence of the other electrolytes. Corrosion rates were, however, controlled during prolonged exposure in the electrolytic media, specially in case of chloride media, due to the predominance of film repair kinetics.</p>

				<title>Effect of cold work and aging on mechanical properties of a copper bearing HSLA-100 steel</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0259-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Influence of cold working and aging on the mechanical properties of a Cu-bearing HSLA-100 steel has been studied. The steel was given solution treatment at 1000$^\circ $C, followed by cold rolling to 25, 50 and 80 pct deformations and aging at 600$^\circ $C for various durations. Substantial improvement in hardness and UTS was observed in the peak aged condition of various treatments, but at the expense of ductility and impactenergy. Extensive scanning electron microscopic studies carried out on impact and tensile fracture surfaces suggest that poor impact energy and low ductility in peak aged condition could be associated with inhomogeneous deformation caused by the existence of coherent precipitates. Other parameters adversely affecting toughness and ductility in various stages of cold work and aging may include high stress concentration at high density dislocation network and dislocation–precipitate interface. Overaging in various treatments resulted in higher impact energy and ductility, presumably due to existence of incoherent precipitates and reduction in stress concentration at dislocation cell boundaries. It is observed that a good combination of high hardness and UTS with high impact energy and ductility could be obtained by a treatment suitable to cause coexistence of coherent and incoherent precipitates.</p>

				<title>Diffusion processes in $\beta$-Zr(Al) phase: a thermodynamic approach</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0267-0273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The diffusion behaviour in the $\beta$-Zr(Al) solid solution phase was investigated in the temperature range 1203–1323 K using a thermodynamic approach. The Boltzmann–Matano relation used for determining interdiffusion coefficients and the Darken’s equations used for evaluating the intrinsic diffusion coefficients from velocity of movement of markers in diffusion couples were modified suitably. The composition dependent thermodynamic interdiffusion coefficients were evaluated using chemical potential gradient. Composition and temperature dependence of the thermodynamic interdiffusion coefficients were also established. The thermodynamic intrinsic diffusion coefficients of Al and Zr and their temperature dependence were determined using the modified Darken’s equations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ceramics, SrTiO$_{3}$ (ST) and 0$\cdot$4, 0$\cdot$8 atom% Ni doped SrTiO$_{3}$, were prepared by solid state reaction route. The average grain size of undoped and doped samples was measured and found to be 1$\cdot$2, 1$\cdot$9 and 3$\cdot$7 $\mu$m, respectively. The impedance measurements were conducted at 400–600$^\circ $C to separate grain and grain boundary contributions. The grain and grain boundaries relaxation frequencies were shifted to higher frequency with temperature. Bulk resistance of doped and undoped ST ceramics was more or less the same. Single grain boundary resistance of doped sample was higher than that of undoped one, indicating that GB resistance increases with acceptor doping. Activation energies were calculated to confirm the same.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Small levels of various dopants have a significant effect on creep in polycrystalline alumina. While most previous studies have examined the effect of ionic size, the influence of valency of dopants on creep has not yet been completely characterized. The present detailed experimental study, utilizing magnesia and zirconia with a similar ionic size, demonstrates that the ionic valency of dopants also plays a crucial role in creep since magnesia does not significantly alter creep whereas zirconia retards creep substantially. Magnesia doped alumina deforms by Coble diffusion creep whereas zirconia doped alumina deforms by an interface controlled diffusion creep process.</p>

					<p>The influence of the cationic polymer, polyethyleneimine polymer (PEI) on the flow behaviour of bentonite suspensions (2%, w/w), was studied. XRD, zeta potential and adsorption studies were done together with rheological measurements. The addition of PEI at concentration ranges of 10$^{-5}$–4$\cdot$5 g/l and their rheological properties and stability of bentonite suspensions were studied. The adsorption rates for the bentonite suspensions are very fast. The XRD results showed that the PEG molecules did not intercalate into the layers of the clay.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the development of thermodynamic databases for multicomponent systems using the cluster expansion–cluster variation methods, we need to have a consistent procedure for expressing the model parameters (CECs) of a higher order system in terms of those of the lower order subsystems and to an independent set of parameters which exclusively represent interactions of the higher order systems. Such a procedure is presented in detail in this communication. Furthermore, the details of transformations required to express the model parameters in one basis from those defined in another basis for the same system are also presented.</p>

					<p>Rare earth based materials have recently attracted considerable attention as potential eco-friendly colourants for low temperature as well as high temperature applications. In the present study, we have synthesized a series of Ca-doped PrPO$_{4}$ compounds with the general formula, Pr$_{1–x}$Ca$_{x}$PO$_{4}$ ($x$ = 0–0$\cdot$4 in steps of 0$\cdot$1) and characterized the compounds by powder X-ray diffraction. All the compositions show a monoclinic monazite structure. The optical properties of the brilliantly coloured pigments [$L$ (brightness), $a^{\ast}$ (+ red - green), $b^{\ast}$ (+ yellow - blue)] have been examined. These materials can find application as potential green colourants.</p>

				<page>0313-0316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metal–organic vapour phase epitaxy/chemical vapour deposition (MOVPE/MOCVD) has emerged recently as the method of choice for large scale preparation of a variety of low dimension inorganic materials; particularly compound semiconductors, used in modern electronic and opto-electronic devices. The success of this process depends on the availability of suitable molecular precursors of desired purity. Group V hydrides (e.g. NH$_{3}$, PH$_{3}$, AsH$_{3}$, SbH$_{3}$) have been employed conventionally for deposition of III–V semiconductor materials. Inherent weakness of this hydride source, particularly heavier ones (for instance very low utilization ($\gt$ 0$\cdot$1%) of AsH$_{3}$ in GaAs synthesis; $\sim$ 4 h half life of SbH$_{3}$ at room temperature) has been a driving force to develop new molecular precursors with desirable properties. This talk will briefly review synthesis and purification of several precursors of groups III (Ga, In), IV, V (As, Sb) and VI (Se, Te).</p>

				<title>Application of photoconductivity decay and photocurrent generation methods for determination of minority carrier lifetime in silicon</title>
				<feature>International Symposium on “Ultrapure Materials: Processing, Characterization and Applications”, Hyderabad, 2004</feature>
				<page>0317-0323</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Minority carrier lifeline, $\tau$, is one of the most important parameters which has a decisive effect on the performance of silicon devices based on excess carriers. The value of $\tau$ is greatly affected by the presence of impurities and defects in silicon and its value provides a fair indication of quality of the material. Photoconductivity decay (PCD) and photocurrent generation (PCG) methods are simple and low cost methods of measurement of minority carrier lifetime in silicon wafers. However, their application requires care. The PCD method can give quite misleading results in case of polycrystalline wafers if there exists potential barriers at the grain boundaries which may affect majority carrier mobility significantly. PCG needs creation of an induced $p^{+}–p–n^{+}$ structure of substantially good quality that should not degrade with time. For PCG method the $\tau$ measurement under vacuum conditions provides correct and consistent results.</p>

				<title>High purity materials as targets for radioisotope production: Needs and challenges</title>
				<feature>International Symposium on “Ultrapure Materials: Processing, Characterization and Applications”, Hyderabad, 2004</feature>
				<page>0325-0330</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radionuclides have become powerful and indispensable tools in many endeavours of human activities, most importantly in medicine, industry, biology and agriculture, apart from R&amp;D activities. Ready availability of radionuclides in suitable radiochemical form, its facile detection and elegant tracer concepts are responsible for their unprecedented use. Application of radioisotopes in medicine has given birth to a new branch, viz. nuclear medicine, wherein radioisotopes are used extensively in the diagnosis and treatment of variety of diseases including cancer. Artificial transmutation of an element employing thermal neutrons in a reactor or high energy particle accelerators (cyclotrons) are the routes of radioisotope production world over. Availability of high purity target materials, natural or enriched, are crucial for any successful radioisotope programme. Selection of stable nuclides in suitable chemical form as targets with desired isotopic and chemical purity are among the important considerations in radioisotope production. Mostly the oxide, carbonate or the metal itself are the preferred target forms for neutron activation in a research reactor. Chemical impurities, particularly from the elements of the same group, put a limitation on the purity of the final radioisotope product. Whereas the isotopic impurities result in the production of undesirable radionuclidic impurities, which affect their effective utilization. Isotope Group, BARC, is in the forefront of radioisotope production and supply in the country, meeting demands for gamut of radioisotope applications indigenously for over four decades now. Radioisotopes such as ${}^{131}$I, ${}^{99}$Mo, ${}^{32}$P, ${}^{51}$Cr, ${}^{153}$Sm, ${}^{82}$Br, ${}^{203}$Hg, ${}^{198}$Au etc are produced in TBq quantities every month and supplied to several users and to Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (BRIT). Such a large production programme puts a huge demand on the reliable sources of availability of high purity target materials which are at present mostly met through import. Availability of suitable target materials, their purity considerations and our efforts in finding sources of raw materials for sustaining the radioisotope programme are discussed here.</p>

				<page>0331-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Available analytical literature reveals that it is possible to identify a lot of procedures to carry out any determination using a plethora of analytical techniques. The fundamental analytical requirements for realizing the desired and acceptable information from a chemical analysis are representative nature of the sample, precision, accuracy, selectivity and sensitivity. These decide, to a larger extent, the selection of the most appropriate methodology in order to obtain chemical information from a system. A number of analytical methodologies are being used in the author’s laboratory for carrying out trace elemental analysis as a part of chemical quality control. Quite a good number of analytical challenges with specific reference to the characterization of high purity materials of relevance to nuclear technology were addressed and methodologies were developed for trace elemental analysis of both metallic and non-metallic constituents. A brief review of these analytical challenges and the analytical methodologies developed and also the future needs of analytical chemist are presented in this paper.</p>

				<feature>International Symposium on “Ultrapure Materials: Processing, Characterization and Applications”, Hyderabad, 2004</feature>
				<page>0339-0343</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Facilities and some results of several spectroscopic methods which have potential applications in the field of analysis of solid high purity substances and which have been elaborated in Russia, will be discussed in this paper. Laser nondispersive atomic fluorescence method with glow discharge cathode sputtering atomiser, may be used for trace element determination as well as a tool for the investigation of technological processes, viz. deposition of thin films. Investigations on reduction of a background level in the new hollow cathode ion source for mass-spectrometry have been carried out. Laser mass spectrometry with tandem laser mass reflectron is successfully designed and applied for gaseous impurities determination in high pure silicon with limit of detection of 10$^{-3}$–10$^{-5}$ ppm wt. Several results of the layer-by-layer and bulk trace analysis of solids by high resolution mass spectrometry with radio frequency powered glow discharge ion source with the limits of detection at 10$^{-1}$–10$^{-3}$ ppm wt will be presented here. The traditional arc and spark emission technique still finds considerable use. One of the examples considered in the paper is the analysis of metalfullerenes. To overcome the calibration problem the fluorination process inside the electrode crater using zinc fluoride has been investigated.</p>

				<title>Recent developments in analytical techniques for characterization of ultra pure materials$—$An overview</title>
				<feature>International Symposium on “Ultrapure Materials: Processing, Characterization and Applications”, Hyderabad, 2004</feature>
				<page>0345-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With continual decrease of geometries used in modern IC devices, the trace metal impurities of process materials and chemicals used in their manufacture are moving to increasingly lower levels, i.e. ng/g and pg/g levels. An attempt is made to give a brief overview of the use of different analytical techniques in the analysis of trace metal impurities in ultrapure materials, such as, high-purity tellurium (7N), high purity quartz, high-purity copper (6N), and high purity water and mineral acids. In recent times mass spectrometric techniques such as ICP–MS, GD–MS and HR–ICP–MS with their characteristic high sensitivity and less interference effects were proved to be extremely useful in this field. A few examples of such application studies using these techniques are outlined. The usefulness of other analytical techniques such as F–AAS, GF–AAS, XRF, ICP–AES and INAA was also described. Specific advantages of ICP–MS and HR–ICP–MS such as high sensitivity, limited interference effects, element coverage and speed would make them powerful analytical tools for the characterization of ultrapure materials in future.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The growth of good quality layers of gallium nitride (GaN) as suitable for epitaxial growth is of great technological importance. Chloride vapour phase epitaxy (Cl–VPE) has been employed to grow good quality layers of GaN. The grown layers have been extensively characterized for their structural and optical properties. MOVPE grown GaN layers have been used to address process issues on device structuring and fabrication. GaN samples with different transition metal dopants have been synthesized and their usefulness as semi-magnetic materials, which are also identified as dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS), have been evaluated. Better results have been obtained on the magnetic characteristics of GaN with ruthenium as the dopant. Nano dimensional structures of GaN have been obtained with excellent control of the growth parameters.</p>

				<feature>International Symposium on “Ultrapure Materials: Processing, Characterization and Applications”, Hyderabad, 2004</feature>
				<page>0361-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the field of advanced ceramics two CRMs were developed in the last few years by the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, one for silicon nitride and one for silicon carbide. Besides their application by industry they are appropriate to be used for the validation of special methods used for trace determination in accordance with high purity materials. This is demonstrated, for example, on ultrapure silicon carbide which was analysed by solid sampling electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (SS ET AAS).</p>
					<p>BAM is also certifying primary pure reference materials used as the National Standards for inorganic analysis in Germany. The crucial point of this project is the certification of the total purity of high purity materials, each representing one element of the periodic table. A variety of different analytical methods was necessary to determine the trace contents of metallic and non-metallic impurities from almost the whole periodic table in the high purity materials. The primary CRMs of copper, iron and molybdenum are used as examples to demonstrate the modus operandi, analytical effects observed by using high resolution ICP mass spectrometry (HR ICP–MS) and the results.</p>

					<p>Possibilities of measurements of low defect concentration in Si by the electrical methods are discussed. The problems arising in such measurements are illustrated by measurements of iron concentration in Si. It is demonstrated that gold diffusion experiments can be used for revealing and study of some electrically inactive defects. Possibility of nondestructive reconstruction of defect depth profiles by DLTS and using the profile obtained for understanding the defect nature is illustrated by the results of hydrogen and hydrogen related defect investigations.

				<title>Certified reference materials of trace elements in water</title>
				<feature>International Symposium on “Ultrapure Materials: Processing, Characterization and Applications”, Hyderabad, 2004</feature>
				<page>0373-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurement of trace elements is playing a vital role in industries and various sectors of science and technology including semiconductors, food, health and environmental sectors. In most of the cases a small error in measurement can vitiate all the measures taken for quality control and management. Many decisions regarding the suitability of material/products are based on the analysis. To reduce or eliminate the rejection rate of the products, accurate and reliable measurements are needed which can be achieved by the use of certified reference materials (CRMs). Their use in calibration of analytical equipments and validation of test methods ensures high quality in measurements and it provides traceability to the measurement data with national/international measurement systems (SI unit) also. In the present scenario of globalization of economy, use of certified reference materials (CRMs) in measurements is essential for global acceptance of products and test reports. Their use fulfil a mandatory requirement of international quality systems (ISO 9000, ISO/IEC standard 17025) including our national accreditation body, National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), World Trade Organization (WTO) etc. International manufacturers of CRMs are meeting most of the requirement of CRMs of the country. To meet the demand of CRMs indigenously, the National Physical Laboratory, India initiated a national programme on preparation and dissemination of certified reference materials.</p>

				<title>Preparation of microstructured hydroxyapatite microspheres using oil in water emulsions</title>
				<feature>Review—Biomaterials</feature>
				<page>0383-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydroxyapatite (HAP) microspheres with peculiar spheres-in-sphere morphology were prepared by using oil-in-water emulsions and solvent evaporation technique. Ethylene vinyl acetate co-polymer (EVA) was used as the binder material. Preparation of HAP/EVA microspheres was followed by the thermal debinding and sintering at 1150$^\circ $C for 3 h to obtain HAP microspheres. Each microsphere of 100–1000 $\mu$m was in turn composed of spherical hydroxyapatite granules of 2–15 $\mu$m size which were obtained by spray drying the precipitated HAP. The parameters such as percentage of initial HAP loading, type of stabilizer, concentration of stabilizer, stirring speed and temperature of microsphere preparation were varied to study their effect on the particle size and geometry of the microspheres obtained. It was observed that these parameters do have an effect on the size and shape of the microspheres obtained, which in turn will affect the sintered HAP microstructure. Of the three stabilizers used viz. polyoxyethylene(20) sorbitan monopalmitate (Tween-40), sodium laurate and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), only PVA with a concentration not less than 0$\cdot$1 wt% showed controlled stabilization of HAP granules resulting in spherical microspheres of required size. Morphologically better spherical microspheres were obtained at 20$^\circ $C. Increasing the stirring speed produced smaller microspheres. Smaller microspheres having size $\lt$ 50 $\mu$m were obtained at a stirring speed of 1500 $\pm$ 50 rpm. A gradual decrease in pore size was observed in the sintered microspheres with increase in HAP loading.</p>

					<p>Crystallization behaviour and magnetic properties of melt-spun Fe–Si–B–Nb–Cu alloys have been investigated. It is found that the primary phase changes from $\alpha$-Fe(Si) to Fe$_{3}$Si (DO$_{3}$) on increasing the Si content. The coercivity of the alloys containing the Fe$_{3}$Si phase is significantly lower as compared to the alloy containing $\alpha$-Fe(Si) phase. A heat treatment temperature–time–coercivity map has been obtained for optimization of the coercivity.</p>

				<page>0405-0410</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Single crystals of the lamellar compound, ZrSe$_{3}$, were grown by chemical vapour transport technique using iodine as a transporting agent. The grown crystals were characterized with the help of energy dispersive analysis by X-ray (EDAX), which gave confirmation about the stoichiometry. The optical band gap measurement of as grown crystals was carried out with the help of optical absorption spectra in the range 700–1450 nm. The indirect as well as direct band gap of ZrSe$_{3}$ were found to be 1$\cdot$1 eV and 1$\cdot$47 eV, respectively. The resistivity of the as grown crystals was measured using van der Pauw method. The Hall parameters of the grown crystals were determined at room temperature from Hall effect measurements. Electrical resistivity measurements were performed on this crystal in the temperature range 303–423 K. The crystals were found to exhibit semiconducting nature in this range. The activation energy and anisotropy measurements were carried out for this crystal. Pressure dependence of electrical resistance was studied using Bridgman opposed anvils set up up to 8 GPa. The semiconducting nature of ZrSe$_{3}$ single crystal was inferred from the graph of resistance vs pressure. The results obtained are discussed in detail.</p>

					<p>Magnetoelectric (ME) composites are two-phase composites consisting of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic materials as the participating constituents. These magnetoelectric composites when placed under external magnetic field, show electrical polarization (magnetoelectric output). The ME coupling is mediated by mechanical stress. In the present study, we have synthesized Ni/PZT/Ni and Fe/PZT/Fe layered composites for studying their ME output by dynamic magnetoelectric set up in which both d.c. and a.c. magnetic fields can be varied. The ME output obtained in these composites are higher than those obtained in 40% Ni$_{0\cdot97}$Co$_{0\cdot03}$Mn$_{0\cdot01}$ Fe$_{1\cdot9}$O$_{4}$ + 60%BaTi$_{1\cdot02}$O$_{3\cdot04}$. The results with varying d.c. and a.c. magnetic fields are presented.</p>

					<p>Polymer composites based on charge-transfer complex of phenothiazine and iodine with polystyrene have been prepared in different weight ratios and characterized by FTIR, XRD, mechanical, microstructure and electrical properties (d.c. as well as a.c.). These composites show semiconducting behaviour as the conductivity increases with increasing temperature. Low percolation threshold (10% wt CTC) has been found indicating that processable conducting polymers with improved mechanical properties can be prepared by this method.</p>

					<p>The $I–V$ characterization and the electrical resistivity of selenium rich Se$_{85}$Cd$_{15–x}$Zn$_{x}$ ($x$ = 0, 3, 7, 11 and 15) system at room temperature have been studied. Samples were obtained using melt cooling technique. So prepared samples were then characterized in terms of their crystal structure and lattice parameter using X-ray diffraction method. The materials were found to be polycrystalline in nature, having zinc blend structure over the whole range of zinc concentration. The measurements of $I–V$ characteristics have been carried out at different temperatures from room to 140$^\circ $C. The electrical resistivity of the samples with composition at room temperature has been found to vary between maximum 2$\cdot$7 $\times$ 10$^{8} \Omega$ m and minimum 7$\cdot$3 $\times$ 10$^{5} \Omega$ m and shows a maximum at 3 at. wt.% of Zn. The carrier activation energy of the samples with composition has also been determined and found to vary from 0$\cdot$026 eV to 0$\cdot$111 eV.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ultra low and negative expansion glass–ceramic materials have been obtained from pyrophyllite and blast furnace slag. The batch composition was modified with the addition of lithium carbonate, hydrated alumina, boric acid and nucleating agent (titania). The batch was melted at 1400$^\circ $C followed by casting in the form of bars and annealed at 510$^\circ $C for 4 h. The annealed specimens were subjected to heat treatment at predetermined temperatures selected from DTA study of the parent glass. Thermal expansion measurement and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the specimen nucleated at 545$^\circ $C for 4 h and crystallized at 720$^\circ $C for 2 h which resulted in negative coefficient of thermal expansion [(–) 9 to (–) 2 $\times$ 10$^{-7}/{}^\circ $C] over the temperature range (30–600$^\circ $C) due to the formation of $\beta$-eucryptite while other heating schedule showed the formation of spodumene and lithium aluminium silicates. The samples showed excellent flexural strength value and varied in the range 120–200 MPa depending upon the phases present.</p>

				<title>Effect of titania on fired characteristics of triaxial porcelain</title>
				<feature>Ceramics and Glasses</feature>
				<page>0445-0452</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Titania was progressively added in the range 3–9 wt% into a triaxial porcelain body consisting of clay, quartz and feldspar. The composed bodies were heated at five different temperatures in the range 1200–1400$^\circ $C and their fired properties as well as phases evolved were studied. The results revealed that beyond 1300$^\circ $C, formation of more liquid phases caused bloating in samples which led to generation of pores. This effect is more pronounced in TiO$_{2}$ containing samples. In the present system, 1300$^\circ $C appeared to be the optimum temperature at which porosity was almost negligible and strength was maximum (45 MPa), particularly in presence of TiO$_{2}$. From the results of XRD studies, it was revealed that quartz content primarily decreased with increase in TiO$_{2}$ content due to excess glass formation and its subsequent dissolution. Mullite content increased with increase in TiO$_{2}$ content. No significant effect was observed beyond 6 wt% addition. Microstructure primarily showed the presence of quartz grain and cluster of smaller sized primary mullite crystals in both the samples without and with TiO$_{2}$. Very few secondary mullite crystals were also observed. SEM picture of sample containing 9 wt% TiO$_{2}$ showed some grain boundary crack due to cooling stress generated in the glassy phase. The drastic reduction of residual strength after 8 cycles of heating at 800$^\circ $C and cooling particularly in TiO$_{2}$ containing samples suggests controlled heat treatment of the vitrified samples necessary to promote secondary crystallization process for the enhancement of strength. Attempts have also been made to correlate the constitutional parameters with the properties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Porous lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics are widely used because of their low acoustic impedance, high figure of merit and high hydrostatic sensitivity. In the present work, porous PZT ceramics were fabricated by incorporating polyethylene oxide (PEO) as pore-forming agent. Both PZT powder and PEO were mixed with a binder at different ratios and compaction was carried out. The samples were slowly heated to remove the pore-forming agent and binder without cracks, followed by controlled sintering and electrode forming. Samples were poled using corona poling technique. The ferroelectric properties and microstructure of the prepared ceramics were characterized. The correlation of porosity with microstructure and ferroelectric properties were discussed.</p>

					<p>Spectroscopic properties of Er$^{3+}$ ions in sodium borate glass have been studied. The indirect and direct optical band gaps ($E_{opt}$) and energy level parameters (Racah ($E^{1}, E^{2}$ and $E^{3}$), spin-orbit ($\xi_{4f}$) and configurational interaction ($\alpha$)) are evaluated. Spectral intensities for various absorption bands of Er$^{3+}$ doped sodium borate glass are calculated. Using Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters ($\Omega_{2}, \Omega_{4}, \Omega_{6}$), radiative transition probabilities ($A$), branching ratios ($\beta$) and integrated absorption cross sections ($\Sigma$) are reported for certain transitions. The radiative lifetimes ($\tau_{R}$) for different excited states are estimated. From the fluorescence spectra, the emission cross section ($\sigma_{p}$) for the transition, ${}^{4}I_{13/2} \rightarrow {}^{4}I_{15/2}$ is reported.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nonaqueous polymer gel electrolytes containing ammonium triflate (NH$_{4}$CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$) and dimethylacetamide (DMA) with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as the gelling polymer have been synthesized which show high value of conductivity ($\sim$ 10$^{-2}$ S/cm) at 25$^\circ $C. The conductivity of polymer gel electrolytes containing different concentrations of NH$_{4}$CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$ shows a small decrease with the addition of PMMA and this has been correlated with the variation of fluidity of these gel electrolytes. The small decrease in conductivity with PMMA addition shows that polymer plays the role of stiffener and this is supported by FTIR results which also indicates the absence of any active interaction between polymer and NH$_{4}$CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$ in these gel electrolytes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Several very large scale integrated (VLSI) devices which are not available in radiation hardened version are still required to be used in spacecraft systems. Thus these components need to be tested for highenergy heavy ion irradiation to find out their tolerance and suitability in specific space applications. This paper describes the high-energy heavy ion radiation testing of VLSI devices for single event upset (SEU) and single event latch up (SEL). The experimental set up employed to produce low flux of heavy ions viz. silicon (Si), and silver (Ag), for studying single event effects (SEE) is briefly described. The heavy ion testing of a few VLSI devices is performed in the general purpose scattering chamber of the Pelletron facility, available at Nuclear Science Centre, New Delhi. The test results with respect to SEU and SEL are discussed.</p>

					<p>The synthesis of ultrafine MoO$_{3}$ through a self-propagating combustion route employing polyethylene glycol as fuel is reported. The precursor molybdenum oxalate is employed in this study for the conversion of the precursor to ultrafine MoO$_{3}$ particles. The solvent casting method is adopted for the synthesis of MoO$_{3}$ dispersed polyvinyl alcohol nanostructured film (MoO$_{3}$–PVA). These synthesized MoO$_{3}$ and their composite samples are characterized for their structure, morphology, bonding and thermal behaviour by XRD, SEM, IR and DSC techniques, respectively. The distribution of MoO$_{3}$ in polyvinyl alcohol gives a crystalline polymer, a compact structure and an increase in glass transition temperature.</p>

					<p>Copper oxide (CuO) thin films with photocurrent as high as 25 $\mu$Α/cm$^{2}$ were deposited on conductive glass substrates using d.c. reactive sputtering. This was the highest reported photocurrent for sputtered $p$-type copper oxide measured in the electrolyte KI. The photocurrent drastically increased up to 25 $\mu$Α/cm$^{2}$ as the sputtering pressure and the substrate temperature were increased up to 8$\cdot$5 mbar and 192$^\circ $C, respectively. All the synthesized films contained single phase of CuO in this range of pressure and substrate temperature.

				<abstract>
					<p>The preparation of indium doped zinc oxide films is discussed. Variation of structural, electrical and optical properties of the films with zinc acetate concentration and indium concentration in the solution are investigated. XRD studies have shown a change in preferential orientation from (002) to (101) crystal plane with increase in indium dopant concentration. Films deposited at optimum conditions have a low resistivity of 1$\cdot$33 $\times$ 10$^{-4} \Omega$m with 94% transmittance at 550 nm. SEM studies have shown smooth polycrystalline morphology of the films. Figure of merit is evaluated from electrical resistivity and transmittance data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc electroplating from non-cyanide alkaline solution is carried out in the presence of condensation product formed between DL-alanine (DLA) and glutaraldehyde. The bath constituents and bath variables are optimized through standard Hull cell experiments. The current efficiency and the throwing power are measured. High shift of potential towards more cathodic direction was observed in presence of addition agents. Corrosion resistance test reveals good protection of base metal by zinc coating obtained from the developed electrolyte. SEM photomicrographs show fine-grained deposit in the presence of condensation product. IR spectrum of the scraped deposit shows the inclusion of the condensation product in the deposit during plating. The consumption of brightener in the lab-scale is 6 mLL$^{-1}$ for 1000 amp-hour.</p>

				<title>Silver nanoparticles of variable morphology synthesized in aqueous foams as novel templates</title>
				<feature>Nanomaterials</feature>
				<page>0503-0510</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we describe the synthesis of silver nanocrystals within aqueous foams as a template. More specifically, we show that aqueous Ag$^{+}$ ions may be electrostatically complexed with the anionic surfactants aerosol OT (sodium $bis$-2-ethylhexyl-sulfosuccinate, (AOT) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)) in a highly stable liquid foam. After drainage of the foam, the silver ions are reduced $in\ situ$ by introducing sodium borohydride into the foam by capillary flow. This leads to the formation of silver nanoparticles of spherical, tape- and sheet-like morphology in the foam. The structure of the foam is extremely complex and presents reaction sites of different spatial extent. The differences in foam reaction–site geometry are believed to be responsible for the morphology variation in the silver nanoparticles observed. The silver nanoparticles are observed to be extremely stable in solution suggesting that the AOT or SDS molecules stabilize them. This approach appears promising for application in large-scale synthesis of nanoparticles and may be readily extended to other chemical compositions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper reports the preparation of full IPNs of gelatin and polyacrylonitrile. Various compositions of gluteraldehyde crosslinked gelatin and N,N′-methylene-$bis$-acrylamide crosslinked PAN were characterized by SEM and DSC techniques. The IPNs were also thermally pretreated by the annealing process. The effects of annealing temperature on the microhardness of IPNs were studied using the Vickers method. SEM indicates the homogeneous morphological features for IPN. The role of gelatin, AN and crosslinker on the developed hard biopolymer has been described with the help of DSC thermograms and microhardness measurements of annealed specimens and good correlation is observed.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, characterization and gas sensing property of hydroxyapatite ceramic</title>
				<feature>Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0535-0545</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydroxyapatite (HAp) biomaterial ceramic was synthesized by three different processing routes viz. wet chemical process, microwave irradiation process, and hydrothermal technique. The synthesized ceramic powders were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR and XPS techniques. The dielectric measurements were carried out as a function of frequency at room temperature and the preliminary study on CO gas sensing property of hydroxyapatite was investigated. The XRD pattern of the hydroxyapatite biomaterial revealed that hydroxyapatite ceramic has hexagonal structure. The average crystallite size was found to be in the range 31–54 nm. Absorption bands corresponding to phosphate and hydroxyl functional groups, which are characteristic of hydroxyapatite, were confirmed by FTIR. The dielectric constant was found to vary in the range 9–13 at room temperature. Hydroxyapatite can be used as CO gas sensor at an optimum temperature near 125$^\circ $C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies showed the Ca/P ratio of 1$\cdot$63 for the HAp sample prepared by chemical process. The microwave irradiation technique yielded calcium rich HAp whereas calcium deficient HAp was obtained by hydrothermal method.</p>

				<title>Effect of cerium addition on microstructures of carbon-alloyed iron aluminides</title>

				<page>0547-0554</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of Ce addition on the microstructure of carbon-alloyed Fe$_{3}$Al-based intermetallic has been studied. Three different alloys of composition, Fe–18$\cdot$5Al–3$\cdot$6C, Fe–20$\cdot$0Al–2$\cdot$0C and Fe–19$\cdot$2Al–3$\cdot$3C–0$\cdot$07Ce (in at%), were prepared by electroslag remelting process. Their microstructures were characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopies. Stereological methods were utilized to understand the observed microstructures. All the alloys exhibited a typical two-phase microstructure consisting of Fe$_{3}$AlC carbides in an iron aluminide matrix. In the alloy without Ce addition, large bulky carbides were equally distributed throughout the matrix with many smaller precipitates interspersed in between. In the alloy with Ce addition, the carbide grain sizes were finer and uniformly distributed throughout the matrix. The effect of Ce addition on the carbide morphology has been explained based on the known effect of Ce in modifying carbide morphology in cast irons.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The growth of PbMoO$_{4}$ crystals by the modified Bridgman method has been reported in this paper. The feed material with strict stoichiometric composition is desirable for the Bridgman growth of the crystals. The continuous composition change of the melts during growth can be avoided because the volatilization of melts is limited by sealed platinum crucibles. By means of the optimum growth parameters such as the growth rate of $\lt$ 1$\cdot$2 mm/h and the temperature gradient of 20 $\sim$ 40$^\circ $C/cm across the solid–liquid interface under the furnace temperature of 1140 $\sim$ 1200$^\circ $C, large size crystals with high optical uniformity were grown successfully. The distribution of Pb and Mo concentration along the growth axis was measured by X-ray fluorescence analysis. The single crystallinity of the grown sample was evaluated by the double-crystal X-ray rocking curve. The transmission spectra were measured in the range of 300–800 nm at room temperature.</p>

High purity Bi$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and TeO$_{2}$ were used as starting materials and were mixed thoroughly with molar ratio of Bi$_{2}$O$_{3}$/TeO$_{2}$ = 1 : 1. Platinum crucible was fabricated with a seed well of 10 mm in diameter and several folds were pressed so that the spontaneous nuclei could be eliminated through competition. The crucible was sealed during the growth so that the evaporation of TeO$_{2}$ was controlled effectively.

				<abstract>
					<p>$In\ situ$ polymerization of pyrrole was carried out in the presence of fly ash (FA) to synthesize polypyrrole–fly ash composites (PPy/FA) by chemical oxidation method. The PPy/FA composites have been synthesized with various compositions (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt%) of fly ash in pyrrole. The surface morphology of these composites was studied with scanning electron micrograph (SEM). The polypyrrole–fly ash composites were also characterized by employing X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The a.c. conductivity behaviour has been investigated in the frequency range 10$^{2}$–10$^{6}$ Hz. The d.c. conductivity was studied in the temperature range from 40–200$^\circ $C. The dimensions of fly ash in the matrix have a greater influence on the observed conductivity values. The results obtained for these composites are of greater scientific and technological interest.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Oxides of the type (La$_{2/5}$Ba$_{2/5}$Ca$_{1/5}$)(Mn$_{(2/5)–x}$Ni$_{x}$Ti$_{3/5}$)O$_{3}$ ($0 \leq x \leq 0\cdot4$) have been synthesized by the ceramic route. All the above oxides have been found to crystallize in the cubic perovskite structure. Rietveld refinement of the Ni-based oxide, (La$_{2/5}$Ba$_{2/5}$Ca$_{1/5}$)(Ni$_{2/5}$Ti$_{3/5}$)O$_{3}$ gave rise to a composition (La$_{0\cdot44}$Ba$_{0\cdot38}$Ca$_{0\cdot18}$) (Ni$_{0\cdot42}$Ti$_{0\cdot58}$)O$_{2\cdot85(6)}$ and the refined lattice parameter obtained was 3$\cdot$9411(2) Å (space group $Pm\bar{3}m; R(F^{2}$) = 0$\cdot$026, $R_{p}$ = 0$\cdot$074, $wR_{p}$ = 0$\cdot$087). A shift from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic behaviour is observed with increase in nickel concentration, the Mn-rich phases showing antiferromagnetism around 5 K. There is a systematic decrease in the dielectric constant, $\varepsilon$ and loss tangent with increase in Ni concentration (from $\varepsilon$ = 592 for $x$ = 0 to $\varepsilon$ = 78 for $x$ = 0$\cdot$4).</p>

				<title>Study of electrical properties of glassy Se$_{100–x}$Te$_{x}$ alloys</title>
				<feature>Ceramics and Glasses</feature>
				<page>0579-0583</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Temperature and frequency dependence of a.c. conductivity have been studied in glassy Se$_{100–x}$Te$_{x}$ ($x$ = 10, 20 and 30) over different range of temperatures and frequencies. An agreement between experimental and theoretical results suggests that the a.c. conductivity behaviour of selenium–tellurium system (Se$_{100–x}$Te$_{x}$) can be successfully explained by correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model. The density of defect states has been determined using this model for all the glassy alloys.</p>
					<p>The results show that bipolaron hopping dominates over single-polaron hopping in this glassy system. This is explained in terms of lower values of the maximum barrier height for single-polaron hopping. The values of density of charged defect states increase with increase in Te concentration. This is in agreement with our previous results obtained from SCLC measurements.</p>

The variation in the values of $H_{c}$ and $M_{s}$, which depends on the additive content and the temperature, was studied by means of a vibration magnetometer. The strong variation observed in coercivity, saturation magnetization and Curie temperature with chemical composition give rise to the possibility of controlling these properties and hence applying these compounds in the millimeter–microwave range.</p>

				<title>Analysis of microstress in neutron irradiated polyester fibre by X-ray diffraction technique</title>
				<feature>Ion Irradiation</feature>
				<page>0593-0598</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microstresses developed in the crystallites of polymeric material due to irradiation of high-energy particle causes peak broadening and shifting of X-ray diffraction lines to lower angle. Neutron irradiation significantly changes the material properties by displacement of lattice atoms and the generation of helium and hydrogen by nuclear transmutation. Another important aspect of neutron irradiation is that the fast neutron can produce dense ionization at deep levels in the materials. The polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibre of raw denier value, 78$\cdot$2, were irradiated by fast neutron of energy, 4⋅44 MeV, at different fluences ranging from $1 \times 10^{9} n/cm^{2}$ to $1 \times 10^{12} n/cm^{2}$. In the present work, the radiation heating microstresses developed in PET micro-crystallites was investigated applying X’Pert-MPD Philips Analytical X-ray diffractometer and the effects of microstresses in tensile strength of fibre measured by Instron have also been reported. The shift of 0⋅45 cm$^{-1}$ in the Raman peak position of 1614⋅65 cm$^{-1}$ to a higher value confirmed the development of microstresses due to neutron irradiation using micro-Raman technique. The defects due to irradiation were observed by SEM micrographs of single fibre for virgin and all irradiated samples.</p>

				<page>0599-0602</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Irradiation effects of a 3 MeV proton beam on polycarbonate (makrofol-DE (MFD)) have been studied with respect to its electrical, thermal and structural behaviour by using an LCR meter, DSC/TGA and FTIR spectroscopy. The dielectric loss/constant was observed to change with the fluence. Thermal analysis revealed that chain scission is the dominant phenomena in irradiated samples based on the reduction of its thermal stability by about 19% at a fluence of 10$^{15}$ ions/cm$^{2}$, which is also corroborated by FTIR spectra. No significant change in intensity of the absorbance bands of the irradiated sample was observed up to a fluence of 10$^{14}$ ions/cm$^{2}$ while on increasing fluence (10$^{15}$ ions/cm$^{2}$) the polymer structure was modified. It appears from DSC thermograms that $T_{g}$ is observed to change with fluence.</p>

				<title>Electron-beam curing of epoxy resins: effect of alcohols on cationic polymerization</title>
				<feature>Ion Irradiation</feature>
				<page>0603-0607</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electron-beam (e-beam) induced polymerization of epoxy resins proceeds via cationic mechanism in presence of suitable photoinitiator. Despite good thermal properties and significant processing advantages, epoxy-based composites manufactured using e-beam curing suffer from low compressive strength, poor interlaminar shear strength, and low fracture toughness. A detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism involving e-beam induced polymerization is required to properly address the shortcomings associated with ebeam curable resin systems. This work investigated the effect of hydroxyl containing materials on the reaction mechanism of e-beam induced cationic polymerization of phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE). The alcohols were found to play important roles in polymerization. Compared to hydroxyl group of aliphatic alcohol, phenolic hydroxyl group is significantly less reactive with the oxonium active centre, generated during e-beam induced polymerization of epoxy resin system.</p>

				<feature>Thin Films</feature>
				<page>0609-0615</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amorphous conducting carbon films deposited over quartz substrates were analysed using X-ray diffraction and AFM technique. X-ray diffraction data reveal disorder and roughness in the plane of graphene sheet as compared to that of graphite. This roughness increases with decrease in preparation temperature. The AFM data shows surface roughness of carbon films depending on preparation temperatures. The surface roughness increases with decrease in preparation temperature. Also some nucleating islands were seen on the samples prepared at 900$^\circ $C, which are not present on the films prepared at 700$^\circ $C. Detailed analysis of these islands reveals distorted graphitic lattice arrangement. So we believe these islands to be nucleating graphitic. Power spectrum density (PSD) analysis of the carbon surface indicates a transition from the nonlinear growth mode to linear surface-diffusion dominated growth mode resulting in a relatively smoother surface as one moves from low preparation temperature to high preparation temperature. The amorphous carbon films deposited over a rough quartz substrate reveal nucleating diamond like structures. The density of these nucleating diamond like structures was found to be independent of substrate temperature (700–900$^\circ $C).</p>

				<feature>Biomaterials</feature>
				<page>0617-0621</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article reports a biomimetic approach for coating hydroxyapatite on titanium alloy at ambient temperature. In the present study, coating was obtained by soaking the substrate in a 5 times concentrated simulated body fluid (5XSBF) solution for different periods of time with and without the use of CaO–SiO$_{2}$ based glass as a possible source of nucleating agent of apatite formation. Optical microscopic and SEM observations revealed the deposition of Ca–P layer on the titanium alloy by both the methods. Thickness of coating was found to increase with the increase in immersion time. The use of glass did not help the formation of apatite nuclei on the substrate and the coating obtained by this method was also not uniform. EDX analysis indicated that the coating consisted of Ca–P based apatite globules, mostly in agglomerated form, and its crystallinity was poor as revealed by XRD.</p>

Hexadecylamine (CH$_{3}$(CH$_{2})_{15}$NH$_{2}$, HDA) was added to the bentonite water dispersion (2%, w/w) in different concentrations in the range 5⋅6 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$–9⋅4 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ m mol/l. The rheological and electrokinetic behaviour of aqueous montmorillonite dispersions was investigated as a function of solid content and HDA concentration. The basal spacings of the HDA/NaMMT composites were studied by X-ray diffraction. The FTIR spectra were obtained from the modified bentonite products, which revealed the characteristic absorbances after treatment with HDA.</p>

					<p>Nano-structured TiO$_{2}$ electrodes, suitable for dye sensitized solid-state solar cells were prepared by a new simple spraying technique (SPT). Physical properties of these electrodes were compared with the electrodes prepared by the ‘doctor blade’ technique (typical sliding method, DB). Dye sensitized solid-state solar cells, comprising of CuI as the hole conductor, were fabricated with these electrodes and enhanced photo responses were obtained with SPT electrodes. The effects of additives, either to the spray solution or to the hole conductor on the photoresponses of the above devices were also studied. The cells fabricated with SPT electrodes containing Al(Bu$^{i}$O)$_{3}$ showed $\sim$ 2⋅4% efficiency and addition of 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium thiocyanate into CuI layer further enhanced the efficiency up to 2⋅75% under the irradiance of 100 mW cm$^{-2}$(AM1⋅5).</p>
