				<title>Sol–gel processing of carbidic glasses</title>
				<feature>Glasses</feature>
				<page>0001-0004</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Carbon incorporation into the silicate network results in the formation of rigid carbidic glasses with improved physical, mechanical and thermal properties. This generated great interest in the development of these heteroatom structured materials through different processing routes. In the present studies, sol–gel processing has been used to prepare silicon based glasses, especially oxycarbides through organic–inorganic hybrid gels by hydrolysis–condensation reactions in silicon alkoxides, 1,4-butanediol and furfuryl alcohol with an aim to introduce Si–C linkages in the precursors at sol level. The incorporation of these linkages has been studied using IR and NMR spectroscopy. These bonds, so introduced, are maintained throughout the processing, especially during pyrolysis to high temperatures. In FFA–TEOS system, copolymerization with optimized mol ratio of the two results in resinous mass. This precursor on pyrolysis to $1000^\circ $C results in Si–O–C type amorphous solid black mass. XRD studies on the materials heated to $1400^\circ $C exhibit presence of crystalline Si–C and cristobalites in amorphous Si–O–C mass. In organic–inorganic gel system, the pyrolysed mass exhibits phase stability up to much higher temperatures. The carbidic materials so produced have been found to exhibit good resistance against oxidation at $1000^\circ $C.</p>

				<title>Collective modes in Ca$_{70}$Mg$_{30}$ glass</title>
				<feature>Glasses</feature>
				<page>0005-0009</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The self-consistent phonon scheme given by Takeno and Goda, involving multiple scattering and phonon eigen frequencies which are expressed in terms of many-body correlation functions of atoms as well as of interatomic potential in the solids, has been used to generate the collective modes in the Ca$_{70}$Mg$_{30}$ glass. A model potential is proposed to describe the effective interaction in the glass. Three different forms of the local field correction functions viz. Hartree, Taylor and Ichimaru and Utsumi are used to examine relative influence of exchange and correlation effects. The phonon frequencies of the longitudinal and transverse modes are computed employing the theoretical formulation of Hubbard and Beeby. The elastic property of the glassy system is then studied using the long wavelength limits of the phonon modes. The theoretical computations reproduce much better dispersion curves (both for the longitudinal and transverse phonons) compared to earlier reports and are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental results due to neutron scattering.</p>

The magnetic susceptibility data of the complexes 8 and 9 in the 300 K–20 K temperature range obeys the Curie–Weiss law and exhibits Weiss constants – 50 K and – 100 K, respectively. On lowering the temperature, the effective magnetic moment decreases gradually and is indicative of antiferromagnetic phase transition. The complexes have also been characterized by ES mass spectrometry, infrared (IR), electronic, and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra.</p>

				<page>0017-0021</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Dielectric capacities and losses were measured, in the temperature (50–170$^\circ $C) and frequency (01–100 kHz range), for undoped and acrylic acid (AA) doped ethyl cellulose (EC) films (thickness about 20 $\mu$m) with progressive increase in the concentration of dopant in the polymer matrix. The variation of capacity with temperature is attributed to thermal expansion in the lower temperature region to the orientation of dipolar molecules in the neighbourhood of glass transition temperature ($T_g$) and random thermal motion of molecules above $T_g$. The dielectric losses exhibit a broad peak. Doping with AA is found to affect the magnitude and position of the peak. AA is found to have a two-fold action. Firstly, it enhances the chain mobility and secondly, it increases the dielectric loss by forming charge transfer complexes.</p>

				<title>An instrument for online measurement of structural orientation in translucent polymer sheets</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0023-0026</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>In many applications of polymer materials, a high tensile strength is required. There is a definite correlation between the degree of orientation of molecular chains achieved in the orientation process and the tensile strength obtained. In this work, we describe design and fabrication details of a device, ‘Laser based polymer orientation grader’, for online measurement of the degree of orientation to obtain a high consistent tensile strength as output. This instrument has been designed making skilful use of the optical anisotropic property of the oriented polymer strip. The principle is based on the fact that the spatial distribution of laser light passing through the translucent polymer sheet depends on the degree of orientation of long chain molecules in the sheet. The method has potential online application in monitoring and controlling of anisotropy in manufacturing processes.</p>

				<title>Role of diffusional coherency strain theory in the discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy</title>
				<feature>Metallic Materials</feature>
				<page>0039-0045</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Discontinuous precipitation (DP) occurs in many alloy systems under certain conditions. It is called discontinuous precipitation because precipitation occurs on prior matrix grain boundaries followed by grain boundary movement. The DP nodule consists of alternate lamellae of the precipitate and the matrix respectively. The chemical driving force for DP is one of solute supersaturation. Although solute supersaturation is responsible for precipitation, it has to be coupled with another driving force to explain grain boundary migration. This coupling driving force has been identified to be diffusional coherency strain which has been verified to be active in diffusion induced grain boundary migration and liquid film migration. To test diffusional coherency strain theory for discontinuous precipitation Mg–7Al and Mg–7Al–1Pb alloys were studied. While the fraction transformed was high at 6% in Mg–7Al alloy, it was significantly low at 2% in Mg–7Al–1Pb alloy. The velocity of DP nodules decreased by half in alloy with Pb as compared to the alloy without Pb. Theoretical calculations also predict that the misfit parameter $d_{th}$ decreases with the addition of Pb. These observations are an evidence to the fact that diffusional coherency strain is the most active driving force for the movement of the grain boundaries of the DP nodules during discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy.</p>

				<title>Role of work hardening characteristics of matrix alloys in the strengthening of metal matrix composites</title>
				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0047-0049</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The strengthening of particulate reinforced metal–matrix composites is associated with a high dislocation density in the matrix due to the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the reinforcement and the matrix. While this is valid, the role of work hardening characteristics of the matrix alloys in strengthening of these composites is addressed in the present paper. It is found that commercial purity aluminium which has the lowest work hardening rate exhibits the highest strength increment. This effect is due to increased prismatic punching of dislocations. This relationship of decreasing work hardening rate associated with increasing prismatic punching of dislocations in the order 7075, 2014, 7010, 2024, 6061 and commercial purity aluminium leading to increased strength increments is noted.</p>

The films were deposited at the potential of – 0 8 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) onto the silver substrate. The different preparative parameters such as deposition potential, deposition time were studied and optimized. These films were then oxidized electrochemically at room temperature in an alkaline (1 N KOH) solution, and also at 600$^\circ $C temperature in an oxygen atmosphere. The films showed the superconducting behaviour, with $T_c$  values ranging between 85 K and 96 K, respectively.</p>

				<title>Dehydration transformation in Ca-montmorillonite</title>
				<feature>Clay Materials</feature>
				<page>0061-0067</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The present work deals with the dehydration transformation of Ca-montmorillonite in the temperature range 30$^\circ $–500$^\circ $C. Thermal, infrared (IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were used to describe the thermal transformation. The microstructural and layer disorder parameters like crystallite size, r.m.s. strain ($e^{2\ 1/2}$), variation of interlayer spacing (g), and proportion of planes which were affected by the defect (g), have all been calculated from the (001) basal reflection using the method of variance and Fourier line shape analysis. These investigations revealed that sample underwent transformation from hydrated phase to dehydrated phase at 200$^\circ $C, and as a consequence, its basal spacing collapsed from 16 02 Å (30$^\circ $C) to around 10 Å (200$^\circ $C). This transformation occurred through a wide range of temperature, i.e. within the range 120$^\circ $–200$^\circ $C. The crystallite size was maximum at room temperature (30$^\circ $C), however, the size decreased with increasing temperature in the hydrated phase, whereas the size increased with increasing temperature for the dehydrated phase. The g, $g$ and e$^{2\ 1/2}$ of the hydrated and the dehydrated phase increased and decreased, respectively with increase of heating temperature.</p>

                    <p>An alloy containing Pb–12% Sn–12% Sb with small addition of copper and arsenic was spray deposited employing two different atomization gas pressure and nozzle to substrate distances. The temperature of the spray-deposit was measured during deposition at a distance of 2 and 10 mm above the substrate-deposit interface. Thermal profile data indicated small variation in temperature with time during deposition stage whereas during post deposition stage an exponential decrease in temperature was recorded. Second phase particle size along the thickness of the deposit varied from 4 to 8 $\mu$m compared to 70 to 80 $\mu$m size of these particles in the as cast alloy. Maximum porosity occurred in the section of the deposit near the contact surface of the substrate and also in its peripheral regions. X-ray diffraction analysis exhibited the formation of additional Cu$_2$Sb phase in the spray-deposit and CuSn and Cu$_{3.3}$Sb phases in atomized powders compared to that of the as cast alloy. The microstructural evolution during spray deposition of this alloy is discussed.</p>

X-ray diffraction study of these compositions revealed the formation of single phase spinels. Seebeck coefficient was obtained from thermo emf measurement by keeping constant temperature difference of 10 K across the pellet. The values of Seebeck coefficient were found to be negative showing majority charge carriers of $n$-type, suggesting the mechanism of conduction to be predominantly by electron hopping. The substitution of Nd$^{3+}$ ion, which perhaps resides at the B-site, resulting in a decrease in the Seebeck coefficient. This decrease was assigned to the decrease of population of Fe$^{3+}$ ion at the B-site. The activation energies calculated both from mobility plots and from dc resistivity plots were found comparable. The Fermi energy, $E_F$(0), which was estimated by intrapolation of $E_F–T$ curves to $T$ $=$ 0 K, was found less than the activation energy. This difference was attributed to electron hopping energy.</p>

                    <p>The magnetic behaviour of two ferromagnetic oxides and two ferrimagnetic oxides (ferrites) are compared to study the effect of magnetocrystalline anisotropy on thermal-history-dependence of magnetization of these ordered magnetic systems. All four compounds show thermomagnetic irreversibility ($M_{FC}$ &gt; $M_{ZFC}$) below a certain temperature, $T_{irr}$. The highly anisotropic ferromagnetic oxide, SrRuO$_3$ and the hard ferrite, SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ show sharp peaks below $T_c$ in their $M_{ZFC}(T)$ curves, whereas for the soft ferrite Ni$_{0.8}$Zn$_{0.2}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ and the low anisotropic ferromagnetic oxide La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ only a broad maximum is observed in $M_{ZFC}$, when measured in small magnetic fields. The shapes of the $M_{ZFC}(T)$ curves are inversely-related to the magnitude of the coercivities $(H_c)$ of the compounds in relation to the applied field, and the temperature dependence of $H_c$. $M_{FC}$ and $M_{ZFC}$ are related through the coercivity for all four magnetic systems.</p>

				<page>0103-0107</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A new type of flyash filled PP/PMMA blend has been developed. Structural and thermal properties of flyash (FA) filled polypropylene (PP)/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend system have been determined and analysed. Filled polymer blends were developed on a single screw extruder. Strength and thermal properties of FA filled and unfilled PP/PMMA blends were determined. Addition of flyash imparted dimensional and thermal stability, which has been observed in scanning electron micrographs and in TGA plot. Increase of flyash concentration increased the initial degradation temperature of PP/PMMA blend. The increase of thermal stability has been explained based on increased mechanical interlocking of PP/PMMA chains inside the hollow structure of flyash.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The aim of the work was to optimize the processing parameters for fabricating laminated ceramic composites of Al$_2$O$_3$–Y–PSZ. Composites of different layer thicknesses, starting from 2 mm and going down up to 0.3 mm, were made by hot-pressing. The different types of cracks originating in the composite were studied in detail and the reason behind their formation analysed. The observed main reasons for crack formation were: (i) differential shrinkage in between the co-sintering layers due to their different sintering kinetics, (ii) thermal expansion mismatch, and (iii) a tensile component of the residual stress in the layer under residual compressive stress. After this defect analysis, suitable remedial measures were taken to avoid the crack formation. And finally a laminated composite with fifteen layers of 0.3 mm thickness was made successfully.</p>

The effects of various process parameters, e.g. coating material concentration, time of deposition, applied current, pH of the suspension and concentration of the polymeric dispersant on the deposition efficiency have been studied. The process has been studied using a 2$^3$-factorial design technique of three independent variables; i.e. coating material concentration, applied current, and the time taken to achieve the best combination. The regression equation obtained explains the experimental results satisfactorily.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Some novel results of a combined sequential study of growth spirals on the basal surface of the richly polytypic CdI$_2$ crystals by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are presented and discussed. In confirmation of the known structural data, the STM pictures clearly reveal the value of unit cell $a(=\ b)$ dimension to be equal to 0.428 nm a and the value of the interaxial angle $\gamma $ to be equal to 120$^\circ $. Under the high resolution and magnification achieved in the scanning electron microscope, the growth steps of large heights seen in the optical micrographs are found to have a large number of additional steps of smaller heights existing between any two adjacent large height growth steps. When further seen by a scanning tunneling microscope, which provides still higher resolution, several unit substeps are seen to exist between two consecutive additional steps. The height of each substep is found to be equal to the unit cell height of the underlying polytype. The height of the larger additional steps are found to be integral multiple of the unit cell height. The horizontal distance between two consecutive growth steps is found to be an integral multiple of the lattice parameter $a$. The interspacing of the growth steps of same step height is found to vary at different positions on the same crystal face.</p>

				<title>On the development of an apatitic calcium phosphate bone cement</title>

				<page>0135-0140</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Development of an apatitic calcium phosphate bone cement is reported. 100 $\mu$ Particles of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) were mixed in equimolar ratio to form the cement powder. The wetting medium used was distilled water with Na$_2$HPO$_4$ as accelerator to manipulate the setting time. The cement powder, on wetting with the medium, formed a workable putty. The setting times of the putty were measured using a Vicat type apparatus and the compressive strength was determined with a Universal Testing Machine. The nature of the precipitated cement was analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and energy dispersive electron microprobe (EDAX). The results showed the phase to be apatitic with a calcium–to–phosphorous ratio close to that of hydroxyapatite. The microstructure analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed hydroxyapatite nanocrystallite growth over particulate matrix surface. The structure has an apparent porosity of $\sim$ 52%. There were no appreciable dimensional or thermal changes during setting. The cement passed the $in\ vitro$ toxicological screening (cytotoxicity and haemolysis) tests. Optimization of the cement was done by manipulating the accelerator concentration so that the setting time, hardening time and the compressive strength had clinically relevant values.</p>

                    <p>In view of discrepancies in the available information on the hardness of lithium niobate, a systematic study of the hardness has been carried out. Measurements have been made on two pure lithium niobate crystals with different growth origins, and a Fe-doped sample. The problem of load variation of hardness is examined in detail. The true hardness of LiNbO$_3$ is found to be 630 $\pm$ 30 kg/mm$^2$. The Fe-doped crystal has a larger hardness of 750 $\pm$ 50 kg/mm$^2$.</p>

The detector system is especially optimized for angle dispersive X-ray diffraction set up using rotating anode generator as X-ray source. The performance of this detector was tested by successfully carrying out powder X-ray diffraction measurements on various materials such as intermetallics AuIn$_2$, AuGa$_2$, high $Z$ material Pd and low $Z$ scatterer adamantane (C$_{10}$H$_{16}$) at ambient conditions. Its utility for quick detection of phase transitions at high pressures with diamond anvil cell is demonstrated by reproducing the known pressure induced structural transitions in RbI, KI and a new structural phase transition in AuGa$_2$ above 10 GPa. Various softwares have also been developed to analyze data from this detector.</p>

				 <title>A note on the use of ellipsometry for studying the kinetics of formation of self-assembled monolayers</title>
				<feature>Nanomaterials</feature>
				<page>0159-0163</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Ellipsometry is currently one of the most important techniques for characterization of the deposition and growth mode of ultra thin organic films. However, it is well known that for thicknesses normally encountered in organic monolayer films, as would occur for example in self-assembled monolayers, ellipsometry cannot be used to simultaneously determine the thickness and refractive index of the monolayer film. Current practice is to assume a reasonable value for the film refractive index and calculate an effective ‘ellipsometric thickness’. This communication seeks to show that the alternative approach of assuming a thickness for the monolayer (determined by the length of the molecule) and calculating the effective film refractive index lends itself to easier and more meaningful physical interpretation. The Lorentz–Lorenz formula is then used to transform the effective refractive index into a surface coverage and hence to an effective mass coverage. The methodology advanced is applied to the kinetics of formation of a self-assembled monolayer of a well-studied molecule, octadecanethiol on Au.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Noble metal powders (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd and Ru) have been synthesized by the polyol process in both the nanometer and submicron scales ($sans$ Pd, Pt and Ru). They have been characterized by both microscopic (TEM and SEM) as well as spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR and XPS). Infrared spectroscopy was employed to study the colloid particles in the presence of ethylene glycol and PVP and the results show that the interaction between the organic phase and the metal particles vary according to the particle size. The role of the solvent, ethylene glycol, during the reduction process was also investigated and we observe formation of &gt;C$=$O vibration band after the reduction process implying that the solvent reduces the metal ions thereby getting oxidized. XPS measurements carried out on the colloidal sols have shown the presence of the organic phase adsorbed onto the metal particles.</p>

While M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu members appear to be mixed conductors with a variable electronic contribution to the conductivity, especially at high oxygen partial pressures ($pO_2 \geq$ 1 atm), arising from mixed-valency of the transition metals, the M $=$ Zn(II) phase is a pure oxide ion conductor exhibiting a conductivity ($\sigma \sim$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{–2}$ S/cm at 800$^\circ $C) that is slightly lower than that of LSGM. The lower conductivity of the M $=$ Zn(II) derivative could be due to the preference of Zn(II) for a tetrahedral oxygen coordination.</p>

				<title>A study on fatigue crack growth in dual phase martensitic steel in air environment</title>
				<feature>Alloys and Steels</feature>
				<page>0193-0199</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Dual phase (DP) steel was intercritically annealed at different temperatures from fully martensitic state to achieve martensite plus ferrite, microstructures with martensite contents in the range of 32 to 76%. Fatigue crack growth (FCG) and fracture toughness tests were carried out as per ASTM standards E 647 and E 399, respectively to evaluate the potential of DP steels. The crack growth rates $(da/dN)$ at different stress intensity ranges ($\Delta K$) were determined to obtain the threshold value of stress intensity range ($\Delta K_{th}$). Crack path morphology was studied to determine the influence of microstructure on crack growth characteristics. After the examination of crack tortuosity, the compact tension (CT) specimens were pulled in static mode to determine fracture toughness values. FCG rates decreased and threshold values increased with increase in vol.% martensite in the DP steel. This is attributed to the lower carbon content in the martensite formed at higher intercritical annealing (ICA) temperatures, causing retardation of crack growth rate by crack tip blunting and/or deflection. Roughness induced crack closure was also found to contribute to the improved crack growth resistance at higher levels of martensite content. Scanning electron fractography of DP steel in the near threshold region revealed transgranular cleavage fracture with secondary cracking. Results indicate the possibility that the DP steels may be treated to obtain an excellent combination of strength and fatigue properties.</p>

                    <p>Time differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) measurement on $\rm\underline{Al}$Hf reference sample has shown that a fraction 0.88 of probe nuclei are defect free and are occupying the substitutional sites in fcc Al matrix, and the remaining are associated with Hf solute clusters. Measurements on helium implanted sample indicate the binding of helium associated defects by Hf solute clusters. Isochronal annealing measurements indicate the dissociation of the helium implantation induced defects from Hf solute clusters for annealing treatments beyond 650 K. On comparison of the present results with that reported in $\rm\underline{Cu}$Hf subjected to identical helium implantation, it is inferred that the Hf solute clusters in $\rm\underline{Al}$Hf bind less strongly the helium associated defects than in $\rm\underline{Cu}$Hf.</p>

                    <p>The response of Nomex sheets to some penetrants has been analyzed. The process of moisture uptake depends on the relative humidity (RH) of the ambient atmosphere and the initial characteristics of the polymer. In the case of common laboratory solvents, the uptake by the polymer shows an inverse dependence on the molar volume of the former. Although the calendered and the uncalendered Nomex sheets exhibit an overall similarity in their response to various penetrants, quantitative comparison reveals distinct differences.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Biodegradable polymers represent one of the most significant area of research today. Among these polymers, poly ($\beta$-hydroxy butyrate co $\beta'$-hydroxy valerate) i.e. PHBV have received special attention because of their unique combination of properties. They are perfectly biocompatible, biodegradable polymers and can be processed by any conventional technique. In the present study an attempt has been made to develop the biodegradable blends of PHBV by blending them with ethyl cellulose (EC). Ethyl cellulose has been selected to monitor the biodegradation rate of PHBV and also for making the blends cost effective. The blends are thoroughly characterized for their compatibility, by the measurement of viscosity of blends and through FT-IR. Various applications of PHBV/EC blend in agriculture and pharmaceutical industries are being explored.</p>

                    <p>Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a high performance polymer having low coefficient of friction, good abrasion resistance, good chemical resistance etc. It is used in shipbuilding, textile industries and also in biomedical applications. UHMWPE is processed by powder processing technique because of its high melt viscosity at the processing temperature. Powder processing technique involves compaction of polymeric powder under pressure and sintering of the preforms at temperature above its melting point. In this study, we report our results on compaction and sintering behaviour of two grades of UHMWPE with reference to the powder morphology, sintering temperatures and strength development.</p>

The well defined loss peaks have been observed in the temperature region where measured ac conductivity approaches dc conductivity. These loss peaks are associated with the hopping of the charge carriers. The frequency and temperature dependence of ac conductivity have been qualitatively explained by considering the contribution from two mechanisms; one giving a linear dependence of conductivity on frequency and other having distribution of relaxation times giving rise to broad dielectric loss peak.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Lattice vibrational properties of europium chalcogenides have been investigated at high pressure by using a simple lattice dynamical model theory viz. the three-body force rigid ion model (TRIM) which includes long range three-body interaction arising due to charge transfer effects. The dispersion curves for the four Eu-chalcogenides agree reasonably well with the available experimental data. Variation of LO, TO, LA and TA phonons with pressure have also been studied at the symmetry points of the brillouin zone (BZ) for Euchalcogenides for the first time by using a lattice dynamical model theory. We have also calculated the one phonon density of states and compared them with the first order Raman scattering results. The calculation of one phonon density of states for Eu-chalcogenides has also been extended up to the phase transition pressure. We observed a pronounced shift in phonon spectrum as pressure is increased.</p>

                    <p>Compositions in CaO–Al$_2$O$_3$ system have been prepared by gel–to–crystallite conversion method. Reactive powders of 1 : 2, 1 : 1, 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 of CaO and Al$_2$O$_3$ compositions were obtained by calcining the product at 800–1200$^\circ $C. Fine grained powders were used as refractory cement for joining alumina ceramics. An optimum temperature of 1450$^\circ $C for 4 h produced joints of satisfactory strength. The microstructure and X-ray phase analysis of the fractured joint surface clearly indicate reactive wetting of the alumina ceramics. This wetting enhances the joining of alumina substrates and can be attributed to the formation of Ca$_{12}$Al$_{14}O$_{33}$ liquid phase. The results are explained by using CaO–Al$_2$O$_3$ phase diagram.</p>

				<title>Optimization of time–temperature schedule for nitridation of silicon compact on the basis of silicon and nitrogen reaction kinetics</title>
				<feature>Nitride Ceramics</feature>
				<page>0249-0253</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A time–temperature schedule for formation of silicon–nitride by direct nitridation of silicon compact was optimized by kinetic study of the reaction, 3Si + 2N$_2$ = Si$_3$N$_4$ at four different temperatures (1250$^\circ $C, 1300$^\circ $C, 1350$^\circ $C and 1400$^\circ $C). From kinetic study, three different temperature schedules were selected each of duration 20 h in the temperature range 1250$^\circ $–1450$^\circ $C, for complete nitridation. Theoretically full nitridation (100% i.e. 66·7% weight gain) was not achieved in the product having no unreacted silicon in the matrix, because impurities in Si powder and loss of material during nitridation would result in 5–10% reduction of weight gain.</p>
                    <p>Green compact of density &lt; 66&#37; was fully nitrided by any one of the three schedules. For compact of density &gt; 66&#37;, the nitridation schedule was maneuvered for complete nitridation. Iron promotes nitridation reaction. Higher weight loss during nitridation of iron doped compact is the main cause of lower nitridation gain compared to undoped compact in the same firing schedule. Iron also enhances the amount of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ phase by formation of low melting FeSi$_x$ phase.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Compositions of the type 3PbO–MgO/ZnO–Nb$_2$O$_5$ were synthesized by the ceramic route at 1000$^\circ $C and sintered at 1200$^\circ $C. Powder X-ray diffraction studies of the 1000$^\circ $C heated products show the presence of the cubic pyrochlore and the columbite (Mg/ZnNb$_2$O$_6$) type phase in the ratio of 3 : 1 for all possible combinations of MgO and ZnO. Further heating at 1200$^\circ $C led to a decrease in the cubic pyrochlore phase and an increase in the columbite phase by around 10&#37;. Compacted pellets sintered further showed the appearance of the perovskite phase. Similar compositions synthesized using the KCl–NaCl molten salt method at 900$^\circ $C for 6 h gave a significant amount of the cubic perovskite related phase of the type Pb(Mg/Zn)$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$O$_3$ for all compositions containing MgO. The amount of the perovskite phase was nearly 55&#37; for the Mg rich compositions and decreased with increase in Zn content, the pure Zn composition yielding mainly the cubic pyrochlore phase. On sintering these phases at 1000$^\circ $C the perovskite phase content decreased. The dielectric constant of the composite materials formed by the ceramic route was in the region of 14 to 20 and varied little with frequency. The composites obtained by the molten salt method, however, showed much larger dielectric constants in the region 40–150 at 500 kHz for various compositions. The dielectric loss tangent of these composites were lower by an order (0·005–0·03 at 500 kHz) compared to the ceramic route.</p>

                    <p>Precursor solutions of cobalt/nickel incorporated nano-grain zirconia films were prepared from aquo-organic solutions of zirconium oxychloride octahydrate and corresponding transition metal nitrate. The films were deposited onto silica glass substrate by the dipping technique. Annealing was made at different temperatures from 450$^\circ $C to 1200$^\circ $C $\pm$ 5$^\circ $C in air atmosphere. The range of thickness of the films baked at 450$^\circ $C was 1800–1870 Å. For cobalt system Co$_3$O$_4$ was formed initially at 450$^\circ $C which gradually transformed to alpha cobalt and next to cubic cobalt along with a non-stoichiometric compound (Zr$_{0·71}$Co$_{0·23}$O$_{0·06}$) with increasing annealing temperature. On the other hand, for nickel system nickel metal of nano-size was observed in the nano-grain zirconia film matrix at 450$^\circ $C. By increasing annealing temperature to 1200$^\circ $C, a compound, ZrNi$_4$O, was formed which was found to be stable for $\sim$ 30 days.</p>

                    <p>The specific heats of superconducting HoBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7–\delta}$ (T$_c \cong $ 92 K) have been theoretically investigated in the temperature domain 70 $\leq$ T $\leq$ 110 K. The bosonic (phonons) contribution to the specific heat is estimated from Debye model in the harmonic approximation for high temperature expansion (T &gt; $\theta_D$/2$pi$) using the moments of the phonon density of states. The fermionic constituent as the electronic specific heat is deduced using a suitable trial function above and below T$_c$. As a next step the contribution of specific heat by charge oscillations (plasmons) are obtained. The theoretical results from bosonic and fermionic terms are then compared with the experimental results. We find that the specific heats from electronic as well as plasmon term are only a fraction of lattice specific heat and in particular, plasmons do not influence the thermal conduction significantly. The implications of the above analysis are discussed.</p>

				<page>0295-0299</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Discontinuous precipitation (DP) occurs in many alloy systems under certain conditions. Although solute supersaturation is the chemical driving force for DP, this has to be coupled with another driving force for grain boundary migration. This was identified to be diffusional coherency strain ahead of the moving boundary in the case of diffusion induced grain boundary migration (DIGM) and liquid film migration (LFM). In the present work, the validity of diffusional coherency strain hypothesis is verified in Mg–Al alloy, which exhibits discontinuous precipitation. Samples were tested with an applied stress simultaneously with discontinuous precipitation and it was found that the velocity of the boundaries both parallel and transverse to the stress axis obeys the model for diffusional coherency strain. This work can be used as a conclusive evidence for diffusional coherency strain hypothesis for the occurrence of discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloys.</p>

This contains a higher concentration of anionic impurities related to differences in the solubility of the original aluminium salts. The sulfate is retained in the gel to higher temperatures at which its eventual decomposition may lead to the formation of a reactive pore structure which facilitates the nucleation of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$.</p>

				<feature>Material Synthesis</feature>
				<page>0305-0307</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>For preparing calcium ferrite, calcium tris (maleato) ferrate(III) precursor was prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of iron(III) maleate, calcium maleate and maleic acid. Various physico-chemical techniques i.e. TG, DTG, DTA, Mössbauer, XRD, IR etc have been used to study the decomposition behaviour from ambient to 900$^\circ $C and ferrite formation. Three consecutive decomposition steps leading to the formation of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and calcium carbonate have been observed at various stages of thermolysis. In the final stage the ferrite, Ca$_2$Fe$_2$O$_5$, is obtained as a result of solid state reaction between $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and calcium carbonate at 788$^\circ $C, a temperature much lower than for ceramic method. The results have been compared with those of the oxalate precursor.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>A simple and inexpensive ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) technique has been employed to deposit tungsten oxide (WO$_3$) thin films by spraying 2·0 mM aqueous ammonium metatungstate solution onto the amorphous glass substrates kept at 250$^\circ $C. The films were further annealed at 400$^\circ $C for 4 h in air. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was used to determine the crystallinity and to identify the WO$_3$ phases. It was found that the films were sub-stoichiometric, WO$_{3–z}$. To study gas-induced properties, a catalyzing layer of platinum (Pt) was sputtered onto it. The gas-induced electrical and optical properties of Pt/WO$_3$/glass samples were studied and results reported. It was found that electrical resistivity decreased by a factor of 10 within 2 min and stabilized after 15 min, after H$_2$ gas exposure. Similarly the optical transmittance of the samples attenuated from 55&#37; to 10&#37; within 15–20 min. The reversible changes in electrical resistivity and optical transmittance were observed when the samples were exposed to oxygen. The response times and sensitivity of the samples were estimated.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The charge-transport behaviour in pure and chloranil (Chl) doped ethyl cellulose (EC) system has been studied by measuring the dependence of current on field, temperature, electrode material and dopant concentration. The role of doping molecular concentration in the polymer matrix and modification in the conduction characteristics are studied. Lowering of the activation energy due to doping was observed. The current was found to increase with an increase in the chloranil concentration. An explanation for this has been attempted on the basis of formation of molecular aggregates between chloranil molecules and ethoxy groups of ethyl cellulose. It is suggested that chloranil occupies interstitial positions between the polymer chains and assists in carrier transportation by reducing the hopping barriers. The current–voltage characteristics of different samples are analyzed using space charge limited current theory and quantitative information about the transport parameters is derived. The values of effective drift mobility and trapped charge carrier concentration which result in the build up of space charge have been calculated.</p>

Nickel-containing compositions gave higher discharge capacities and smaller hystereses in their charge–discharge profiles which make them more attractive than pristine LiCoO$_2$  as cathode materials in high-energy lithium cells. The lower loss in capacity per cycle for cells with unsubstituted LiCoO$_2$ , as determined from cycling studies up to 25 cycles, makes it more suitable than the substituted ones for long cycle-life cells with low capacity fade.</p>

The results have been analyzed on the basis of structural relaxation equation, Matusita’s equation and modified Kissinger’s equation. The activation energies of structural relaxation lie in between 226 and 593 kJ/mol. The crystallization growth is found to be onedimensional for all compositions. The activation energies of crystallization are found to be 100–136 kJ/mol by Matusita’s equation while 102–139 kJ/mol by modified Kissinger’s equation. The Hruby number (indicator of ease of glass forming and higher stability) is the highest for Se$_{85}$Te$_9$Pb$_6$  glass while S factor (indicator of resistance to devitrification) is highest for Se$_{85}$Te$_7$Pb$_8$  glass at all heating rates in our experiment. Further the highest resistance to devitrification has the highest value of structural activation energy and the activation energy of crystallization is maximum for the most stable glass by both Matusita’s equation and the modified Kissinger’s equation.</p>

                    <p>Synthesis of machinable quality magnesium aluminium silicate (MgO–Al$_2$O$_3$–SiO$_2$) for fabrication of insulators/spacers usable in high voltage applications under high vacuum conditions has been carried out following two different routes i.e. (i) sintering route, and (ii) glass route. A three-stage heating schedule involving calcination, nucleation and crystallization, has been evolved for the preparation of magnesium aluminium silicate (MAS) glass ceramic with MgF$_2$  as a nucleating agent. The effect of sintering temperature on the density of compacted material was studied. Microstructure and machinability of samples obtained from both routes were investigated. They were also characterized for microhardness. Initial studies on material obtained by glass route reveal that these samples are superior to those obtained from sintered route in respect of their high voltage breakdown strength and outgassing behaviour. Outgassing rate of 10$^{–9}$ Torr l s$^{–1}$ cm$^{–2}$  and breakdown strength of 160 kV/cm were obtained. Different types of spacers, lugs, nuts and bolts have been prepared by direct machining of the indigenously developed glass ceramic.</p>

                    <p>A hydrogen-storage alloy of the composition Zr$_{0\ 5}$Ti$_{0\ 5}$V$_{0\ 6}$Cr$_{0\ 2}$Ni$_{1\ 2}$ has been investigated for corrosion resistance and hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) in KOH electrolyte of varying concentrations. Activation of the electrode by absorption of hydrogen takes place after prolonged cathodic polarization in the potential range of HER. Prior to activation, the open-circuit potential is about – 0 4 V vs Hg/HgO, OH$^–$ , at which the alloy electrode tends to undergo corrosion with oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) as the conjugate reaction. The corrosion–current density measured from Tafel polarization of ORR is found to be independent of KOH concentration and has an average value of about 30 $\mu$A cm$^{–2}$ . Subsequent to activation, the open circuit potential of the electrode is shifted to about – 0 93 V vs Hg/HgO, OH$^–$ , which is equal to the reversible potential of HER. The exchange current density values measured from Tafel polarization of HER are marginally higher in relation to the values obtained before the electrode is activated. Alternating-current impedance spectra in the Nyquist form contain two overlapped semicircles. The high-frequency semicircle is attributed to the electrode geometry, while the low-frequency semicircle is due to the charge-transfer reaction and double–layer capacitance. The impedance data are analyzed by a non-linear least square curve fitting technique and impedance parameters are evaluated. </p>

                    <p>The corrosion behaviour of two carbon-alloyed intermetallics of composition Fe–28 1Al–2 1C and Fe–27 5Al–3 7C has been studied and compared with that of binary intermetallics. Potentiodynamic polarization studies indicated that the intermetallics exhibited active–passive behaviour in an acidic solution of pH = 1, whereas they exhibited stable passivity in a buffer solution of pH 8 4. Corrosion rates were also obtained by immersion testing. The variation of corrosion rate as a function of time was similar for both the intermetallics. The variation in corrosion rate as a function of time has been explained based on the observed potentiodynamic polarization behaviour. Scanning electron microscopy of corroded surfaces indicated that the carbon-alloyed intermetallics were susceptible to galvanic corrosion, due to the presence of carbides.</p>

				<title>A model for two-step ageing</title>
				<feature>Steels and Alloys</feature>
				<page>0405-0411</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>In commercial practice, two-step ageing is commonly used in Al–Zn–Mg alloys to produce a fine dispersion of $h$ precipitates to accentuate the mechanical properties and resistance to stress corrosion cracking. While this is true in Al–Zn–Mg alloys, two-step ageing leads to inferior properties in Al–Mg–Si alloys. This controversial behaviour in different alloys can be explained by Pashley’s Kinetic model. Pashley’s model addresses the stability of clusters after two-step ageing. In the development of the model, the surface energy term between cluster and matrix is taken into account while the coherency strains between the cluster and matrix are not considered. In the present work, a model is developed which takes into account the coherency strains between cluster and matrix and defines a new stability criterion, inclusive of strain energy term. Experiments were done on AA 7010 aluminium alloy by carrying out a two-step ageing treatment and the results fit the new stability criterion. Thus it is found that the new model for two-step ageing is verified in the case of Al–Zn–Mg alloy.</p>

                    <p>A series of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) of castor oil based polyurethane/polyacrylonitrile (PU/PAN: 80/20, 60/40, 50/50, 40/60 and 20/80) were synthesized by condensation reaction of castor oil with methylene diisocyanate and acrylonitrile, employing benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate (EGDM) as initiator and crosslinkers respectively. The physical, chemical, optical and some of the mechanical properties of PU/PAN were studied. Phase stabilization in IPNs was investigated by wide angle X-ray (WAXS) profile analysis. Variation of crystal size distribution was studied in these polymer networks.</p>

				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0419-0423</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>An appreciable electric current is observed in a system consisting of a polyvinyl formal (PVF) film in a sandwich configuration, in the temperature range 30–110$^\circ $C. The maximum value of the current during first heating is found to be of the order of 10$^{–10}$ A and its thermograms exhibit one transition (i.e. current peak) at around 60$^\circ $C. The position of the current peak in thermal spectrum shifts with the heating rate. A temperature dependence of the open circuit voltage is also observed. The activation energy of the process responsible for the current is determined. The magnitude of the current is more in the case of dissimilar electrode systems. It is proposed that the electric current arising from unpolarized metal–polymer–metal system is a water activated phenomenon, which is influenced by the transitional changes of the polymer.</p>

				<title>Aliphatic amine cured PDMS–epoxy interpenetrating network system for high performance engineering applications—Development and characterization</title>
				<feature>Polymers</feature>
				<page>0425-0429</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A siliconized epoxy interpenetrating network (IPN) was synthesized from commercially available DGEBA epoxy resin GY250 (Ciba-Geigy, epoxy equivalent = 182–192, viscosity = 9000–12000 cP) and hydroxyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). PDMS and GY250 were thoroughly mixed at 30$^\circ $C to get the prepolymer. Stoichiometric amounts of PDMS–epoxy prepolymer, $g$-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, aliphatic amine curing agent (HY951), and dibutyltindilaurate catalyst, were thoroughly mixed and cast in a mould after evacuating the entrapped air. The cured material was then taken out and post cured at 70$^\circ $C for 10 h. IPN was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, DSC, TGA and viscosity measurements. Incorporation of PDMS in the epoxy matrix increased the viscosity and lowered the exotherm and pot-life. PDMS in IPN increased $T_g$ , heat-distortion temperature and reduced the percentage weight loss with increase in temperature. Incorporation of PDMS drastically reduced the tensile and flexural strengths and hardness. By reducing the tensile and flexural modulus, the siloxane moiety effectively reduced the internal stress of IPN thereby improving its impact strength and percentage elongation. PDMS increased the electric potential gradient of IPN to withstand without breakdown. An increase in the tracking index and arc resistance of IPN were observed, because of the presence of Si–O–Si, which minimized the possibility of forming carbonized path. Volume and surface resistivities of IPN also increased with the incorporation of PDMS. The siliconized epoxy IPN, with better impact and thermal resistance, may be used in automobile and aerospace applications to withstand high temperature, and mechanical stress. The PDMS–epoxy IPN may be used for encapsulation, high temperature and high voltage application due to their low shrinkage and lesser internal stress. With the improved electrical characteristics, IPN may be used for high performance electrical insulation, insulator housings, and encapsulation to withstand high voltage, moisture, oxidation, chemical attack, biological attack, outdoor weathering, contamination, electrical, mechanical and thermal stress.</p>

                    <p>The system SrBi$_4$Ti$_{4–3x}$Fe$_{4x}$O$_{15}$ belonging to bismuth layer structured ferroelectric (BLSF) materials with $x$ = 0, 0 1 and 0 2 has been prepared through solid-state double sintering method. Increase of iron content in SrBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ resulted in densification of the samples. The normal puckering observed in the sample has been found to decrease and the lattice distortion increased. Dielectric measurements indicate the ferroelectric transition temperature of the samples to be 530$^\circ $C, 560$^\circ $C and 606$^\circ $C. The increase of transition temperature with increasing iron content is correlated with lattice distortion. Conductivity measurements show two slopes and the activation energies have been found to increase with the iron content. Impedance spectroscopy measurements confirm insulating behaviour at lower temperatures. With increase in temperature the samples become conducting and show relaxational effects. The Cole–Cole plots at higher temperatures are found to be semicircles. The relaxation times decrease with the increase of iron content.</p>

                    <p>Thermal conductivity of a set of $(Bi_{0 8}Pb_{0 2–y}V_y)_2Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+d}$(0 = $y$ 0 05) pellets in the temperature range between 10 and 150 K is reported. Vanadium substitution influences strongly the magnitude of thermal conductivity ($l$) over the entire temperature range. But the nature of $l(T)$ dependence remains similar to that generally observed for HTSCs. The electronic contribution to the total $l$ in the normal state is estimated to be $\sim$ 25%. We have attempted to examine our data, assuming the role of both electrons and phonons in the origin of the $l(T)$ behaviour below $T_c$ . Observed temperature variation of $l(T)$ for the present set of samples could be explained very well assuming this electron + approach. Some of the microscopic quantities estimated from the best-fit parameters give reasonable values.</p>

The size of platinum nanoparticles was controlled by changing the ratio of concentration of capping polymer material to the concentration of platinum cation used. The morphology of colloidal particles were studied by means of UV-visible spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Particle size increased with low reagent concentration. The change in absorption spectra with the particle size was observed, i.e. blue shift attributed to decrease in particle size.</p>

				<title>Investigations on Tl-2223 thin films fabricated through ultrasonic spray pyrolysis under oxygen deficient conditions</title>
				<feature>Superconductors</feature>
				<page>0475-0481</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>In this paper we have shown that polycrystalline films corresponding to Tl-2223 phase can be grown by employing high thalliation temperatures and short thalliation times. Ultrasonically deposited precursor films corresponding to Ba$_2$Ca$_{2\ 2}$Cu$_{3\ 3}$O$_x$(Ag$_y$) have been thalliated under high vacuum ($\sim$ 10$^{–5}$ torr) at 890$^\circ $C to obtain single phase Tl-2223 films. An off-stoichiometric and unreacted pellet of composition Tl$_{2\ 05}$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_z$  has been used as source of Tl. We have shown that oxygen ambient is not necessary for the growth of Tl-2223 phase. The as-thalliated films have $T_c$’s in the range 123 K $\pm$ 0 70 K. The $T_c$  has been found to be independent of the addition of AgNO$_3$  to the precursor. The zero field transport $J_c$  has been observed to be &gt; 1 2 × 10$^5$  A/cm$^2$  at 77 K. Near $T_c$  (110 K–122 K), $J_c$  has been observed to follow the power law $J_c$ $(1 – T/T_c)^p , p$ 2. A power law with $p $ 1 4 has been observed for the temperature range 70 K–110 K. An optimum doping of Ag has been observed to induce about 25% increase in $J_c$  and it also leads to uniform and enlarged grain growth. The surface morphology of Ag free samples contains plate like grains having arbitrary shapes. In contrast to this 0 35 Ag doped sample exhibits nearly rectangular plate like grains.</p>
