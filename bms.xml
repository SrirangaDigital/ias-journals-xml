				<title>Sol–gel processing of carbidic glasses</title>
				<feature>Glasses</feature>
				<page>0001-0004</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Carbon incorporation into the silicate network results in the formation of rigid carbidic glasses with improved physical, mechanical and thermal properties. This generated great interest in the development of these heteroatom structured materials through different processing routes. In the present studies, sol–gel processing has been used to prepare silicon based glasses, especially oxycarbides through organic–inorganic hybrid gels by hydrolysis–condensation reactions in silicon alkoxides, 1,4-butanediol and furfuryl alcohol with an aim to introduce Si–C linkages in the precursors at sol level. The incorporation of these linkages has been studied using IR and NMR spectroscopy. These bonds, so introduced, are maintained throughout the processing, especially during pyrolysis to high temperatures. In FFA–TEOS system, copolymerization with optimized mol ratio of the two results in resinous mass. This precursor on pyrolysis to $1000^\circ $C results in Si–O–C type amorphous solid black mass. XRD studies on the materials heated to $1400^\circ $C exhibit presence of crystalline Si–C and cristobalites in amorphous Si–O–C mass. In organic–inorganic gel system, the pyrolysed mass exhibits phase stability up to much higher temperatures. The carbidic materials so produced have been found to exhibit good resistance against oxidation at $1000^\circ $C.</p>

				<title>Collective modes in Ca$_{70}$Mg$_{30}$ glass</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0005-0009</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The self-consistent phonon scheme given by Takeno and Goda, involving multiple scattering and phonon eigen frequencies which are expressed in terms of many-body correlation functions of atoms as well as of interatomic potential in the solids, has been used to generate the collective modes in the Ca$_{70}$Mg$_{30}$ glass. A model potential is proposed to describe the effective interaction in the glass. Three different forms of the local field correction functions viz. Hartree, Taylor and Ichimaru and Utsumi are used to examine relative influence of exchange and correlation effects. The phonon frequencies of the longitudinal and transverse modes are computed employing the theoretical formulation of Hubbard and Beeby. The elastic property of the glassy system is then studied using the long wavelength limits of the phonon modes. The theoretical computations reproduce much better dispersion curves (both for the longitudinal and transverse phonons) compared to earlier reports and are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental results due to neutron scattering.</p>

The magnetic susceptibility data of the complexes 8 and 9 in the 300 K–20 K temperature range obeys the Curie–Weiss law and exhibits Weiss constants – 50 K and – 100 K, respectively. On lowering the temperature, the effective magnetic moment decreases gradually and is indicative of antiferromagnetic phase transition. The complexes have also been characterized by ES mass spectrometry, infrared (IR), electronic, and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Dielectric capacities and losses were measured, in the temperature (50–170$^\circ $C) and frequency (01–100 kHz range), for undoped and acrylic acid (AA) doped ethyl cellulose (EC) films (thickness about 20 $\mu$m) with progressive increase in the concentration of dopant in the polymer matrix. The variation of capacity with temperature is attributed to thermal expansion in the lower temperature region to the orientation of dipolar molecules in the neighbourhood of glass transition temperature ($T_g$) and random thermal motion of molecules above $T_g$. The dielectric losses exhibit a broad peak. Doping with AA is found to affect the magnitude and position of the peak. AA is found to have a two-fold action. Firstly, it enhances the chain mobility and secondly, it increases the dielectric loss by forming charge transfer complexes.</p>

				<page>0023-0026</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>In many applications of polymer materials, a high tensile strength is required. There is a definite correlation between the degree of orientation of molecular chains achieved in the orientation process and the tensile strength obtained. In this work, we describe design and fabrication details of a device, ‘Laser based polymer orientation grader’, for online measurement of the degree of orientation to obtain a high consistent tensile strength as output. This instrument has been designed making skilful use of the optical anisotropic property of the oriented polymer strip. The principle is based on the fact that the spatial distribution of laser light passing through the translucent polymer sheet depends on the degree of orientation of long chain molecules in the sheet. The method has potential online application in monitoring and controlling of anisotropy in manufacturing processes.</p>

				<title>Role of diffusional coherency strain theory in the discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0039-0045</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Discontinuous precipitation (DP) occurs in many alloy systems under certain conditions. It is called discontinuous precipitation because precipitation occurs on prior matrix grain boundaries followed by grain boundary movement. The DP nodule consists of alternate lamellae of the precipitate and the matrix respectively. The chemical driving force for DP is one of solute supersaturation. Although solute supersaturation is responsible for precipitation, it has to be coupled with another driving force to explain grain boundary migration. This coupling driving force has been identified to be diffusional coherency strain which has been verified to be active in diffusion induced grain boundary migration and liquid film migration. To test diffusional coherency strain theory for discontinuous precipitation Mg–7Al and Mg–7Al–1Pb alloys were studied. While the fraction transformed was high at 6% in Mg–7Al alloy, it was significantly low at 2% in Mg–7Al–1Pb alloy. The velocity of DP nodules decreased by half in alloy with Pb as compared to the alloy without Pb. Theoretical calculations also predict that the misfit parameter $d_{th}$ decreases with the addition of Pb. These observations are an evidence to the fact that diffusional coherency strain is the most active driving force for the movement of the grain boundaries of the DP nodules during discontinuous precipitation in Mg–Al alloy.</p>

				<title>Role of work hardening characteristics of matrix alloys in the strengthening of metal matrix composites</title>
				<feature>Composites</feature>
				<page>0047-0049</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The strengthening of particulate reinforced metal–matrix composites is associated with a high dislocation density in the matrix due to the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the reinforcement and the matrix. While this is valid, the role of work hardening characteristics of the matrix alloys in strengthening of these composites is addressed in the present paper. It is found that commercial purity aluminium which has the lowest work hardening rate exhibits the highest strength increment. This effect is due to increased prismatic punching of dislocations. This relationship of decreasing work hardening rate associated with increasing prismatic punching of dislocations in the order 7075, 2014, 7010, 2024, 6061 and commercial purity aluminium leading to increased strength increments is noted.</p>

The films were deposited at the potential of – 0 8 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) onto the silver substrate. The different preparative parameters such as deposition potential, deposition time were studied and optimized. These films were then oxidized electrochemically at room temperature in an alkaline (1 N KOH) solution, and also at 600$^\circ $C temperature in an oxygen atmosphere. The films showed the superconducting behaviour, with $T_c$  values ranging between 85 K and 96 K, respectively.</p>

				<feature>Clay Materials</feature>
				<page>0061-0067</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The present work deals with the dehydration transformation of Ca-montmorillonite in the temperature range 30$^\circ $–500$^\circ $C. Thermal, infrared (IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were used to describe the thermal transformation. The microstructural and layer disorder parameters like crystallite size, r.m.s. strain ($e^{2\ 1/2}$), variation of interlayer spacing (g), and proportion of planes which were affected by the defect (g), have all been calculated from the (001) basal reflection using the method of variance and Fourier line shape analysis. These investigations revealed that sample underwent transformation from hydrated phase to dehydrated phase at 200$^\circ $C, and as a consequence, its basal spacing collapsed from 16 02 Å (30$^\circ $C) to around 10 Å (200$^\circ $C). This transformation occurred through a wide range of temperature, i.e. within the range 120$^\circ $–200$^\circ $C. The crystallite size was maximum at room temperature (30$^\circ $C), however, the size decreased with increasing temperature in the hydrated phase, whereas the size increased with increasing temperature for the dehydrated phase. The g, $g$ and e$^{2\ 1/2}$ of the hydrated and the dehydrated phase increased and decreased, respectively with increase of heating temperature.</p>

                    <p>An alloy containing Pb–12% Sn–12% Sb with small addition of copper and arsenic was spray deposited employing two different atomization gas pressure and nozzle to substrate distances. The temperature of the spray-deposit was measured during deposition at a distance of 2 and 10 mm above the substrate-deposit interface. Thermal profile data indicated small variation in temperature with time during deposition stage whereas during post deposition stage an exponential decrease in temperature was recorded. Second phase particle size along the thickness of the deposit varied from 4 to 8 $\mu$m compared to 70 to 80 $\mu$m size of these particles in the as cast alloy. Maximum porosity occurred in the section of the deposit near the contact surface of the substrate and also in its peripheral regions. X-ray diffraction analysis exhibited the formation of additional Cu$_2$Sb phase in the spray-deposit and CuSn and Cu$_{3.3}$Sb phases in atomized powders compared to that of the as cast alloy. The microstructural evolution during spray deposition of this alloy is discussed.</p>

X-ray diffraction study of these compositions revealed the formation of single phase spinels. Seebeck coefficient was obtained from thermo emf measurement by keeping constant temperature difference of 10 K across the pellet. The values of Seebeck coefficient were found to be negative showing majority charge carriers of $n$-type, suggesting the mechanism of conduction to be predominantly by electron hopping. The substitution of Nd$^{3+}$ ion, which perhaps resides at the B-site, resulting in a decrease in the Seebeck coefficient. This decrease was assigned to the decrease of population of Fe$^{3+}$ ion at the B-site. The activation energies calculated both from mobility plots and from dc resistivity plots were found comparable. The Fermi energy, $E_F$(0), which was estimated by intrapolation of $E_F–T$ curves to $T$ $=$ 0 K, was found less than the activation energy. This difference was attributed to electron hopping energy.</p>

                    <p>The magnetic behaviour of two ferromagnetic oxides and two ferrimagnetic oxides (ferrites) are compared to study the effect of magnetocrystalline anisotropy on thermal-history-dependence of magnetization of these ordered magnetic systems. All four compounds show thermomagnetic irreversibility ($M_{FC}$ &gt; $M_{ZFC}$) below a certain temperature, $T_{irr}$. The highly anisotropic ferromagnetic oxide, SrRuO$_3$ and the hard ferrite, SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ show sharp peaks below $T_c$ in their $M_{ZFC}(T)$ curves, whereas for the soft ferrite Ni$_{0.8}$Zn$_{0.2}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ and the low anisotropic ferromagnetic oxide La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ only a broad maximum is observed in $M_{ZFC}$, when measured in small magnetic fields. The shapes of the $M_{ZFC}(T)$ curves are inversely-related to the magnitude of the coercivities $(H_c)$ of the compounds in relation to the applied field, and the temperature dependence of $H_c$. $M_{FC}$ and $M_{ZFC}$ are related through the coercivity for all four magnetic systems.</p>

				<page>0103-0107</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>A new type of flyash filled PP/PMMA blend has been developed. Structural and thermal properties of flyash (FA) filled polypropylene (PP)/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend system have been determined and analysed. Filled polymer blends were developed on a single screw extruder. Strength and thermal properties of FA filled and unfilled PP/PMMA blends were determined. Addition of flyash imparted dimensional and thermal stability, which has been observed in scanning electron micrographs and in TGA plot. Increase of flyash concentration increased the initial degradation temperature of PP/PMMA blend. The increase of thermal stability has been explained based on increased mechanical interlocking of PP/PMMA chains inside the hollow structure of flyash.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>The aim of the work was to optimize the processing parameters for fabricating laminated ceramic composites of Al$_2$O$_3$–Y–PSZ. Composites of different layer thicknesses, starting from 2 mm and going down up to 0.3 mm, were made by hot-pressing. The different types of cracks originating in the composite were studied in detail and the reason behind their formation analysed. The observed main reasons for crack formation were: (i) differential shrinkage in between the co-sintering layers due to their different sintering kinetics, (ii) thermal expansion mismatch, and (iii) a tensile component of the residual stress in the layer under residual compressive stress. After this defect analysis, suitable remedial measures were taken to avoid the crack formation. And finally a laminated composite with fifteen layers of 0.3 mm thickness was made successfully.</p>

The effects of various process parameters, e.g. coating material concentration, time of deposition, applied current, pH of the suspension and concentration of the polymeric dispersant on the deposition efficiency have been studied. The process has been studied using a 2$^3$-factorial design technique of three independent variables; i.e. coating material concentration, applied current, and the time taken to achieve the best combination.

				<abstract>
                    <p>Some novel results of a combined sequential study of growth spirals on the basal surface of the richly polytypic CdI$_2$ crystals by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are presented and discussed. In confirmation of the known structural data, the STM pictures clearly reveal the value of unit cell $a(=\ b)$ dimension to be equal to 0.428 nm a and the value of the interaxial angle $\gamma $ to be equal to 120$^\circ $. Under the high resolution and magnification achieved in the scanning electron microscope, the growth steps of large heights seen in the optical micrographs are found to have a large number of additional steps of smaller heights existing between any two adjacent large height growth steps. When further seen by a scanning tunneling microscope, which provides still higher resolution, several unit substeps are seen to exist between two consecutive additional steps. The height of each substep is found to be equal to the unit cell height of the underlying polytype. The height of the larger additional steps are found to be integral multiple of the unit cell height. The horizontal distance between two consecutive growth steps is found to be an integral multiple of the lattice parameter $a$. The interspacing of the growth steps of same step height is found to vary at different positions on the same crystal face.</p>

				<title>On the development of an apatitic calcium phosphate bone cement</title>

				<page>0135-0140</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Development of an apatitic calcium phosphate bone cement is reported. 100 $\mu$ Particles of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) were mixed in equimolar ratio to form the cement powder. The wetting medium used was distilled water with Na$_2$HPO$_4$ as accelerator to manipulate the setting time. The cement powder, on wetting with the medium, formed a workable putty. The setting times of the putty were measured using a Vicat type apparatus and the compressive strength was determined with a Universal Testing Machine. The nature of the precipitated cement was analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and energy dispersive electron microprobe (EDAX). The results showed the phase to be apatitic with a calcium–to–phosphorous ratio close to that of hydroxyapatite. The microstructure analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed hydroxyapatite nanocrystallite growth over particulate matrix surface. The structure has an apparent porosity of $\sim$ 52%. There were no appreciable dimensional or thermal changes during setting. The cement passed the $in\ vitro$ toxicological screening (cytotoxicity and haemolysis) tests. Optimization of the cement was done by manipulating the accelerator concentration so that the setting time, hardening time and the compressive strength had clinically relevant values.</p>

Measurements have been made on two pure lithium niobate crystals with different growth origins, and a Fe-doped sample. The problem of load variation of hardness is examined in detail. The true hardness of LiNbO$_3$ is found to be 630 $\pm$ 30 kg/mm$^2$. The Fe-doped crystal has a larger hardness of 750 $\pm$ 50 kg/mm$^2$.</p>

The detector system is especially optimized for angle dispersive X-ray diffraction set up using rotating anode generator as X-ray source. The performance of this detector was tested by successfully carrying out powder X-ray diffraction measurements on various materials such as intermetallics AuIn$_2$, AuGa$_2$, high $Z$ material Pd and low $Z$ scatterer adamantane (C$_{10}$H$_{16}$) at ambient conditions. Its utility for quick detection of phase transitions at high pressures with diamond anvil cell is demonstrated by reproducing the known pressure induced structural transitions in RbI, KI and a new structural phase transition in AuGa$_2$ above 10 GPa.

				 <title>A note on the use of ellipsometry for studying the kinetics of formation of self-assembled monolayers</title>
				<feature>Nanomaterials</feature>
				<page>0159-0163</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Ellipsometry is currently one of the most important techniques for characterization of the deposition and growth mode of ultra thin organic films. However, it is well known that for thicknesses normally encountered in organic monolayer films, as would occur for example in self-assembled monolayers, ellipsometry cannot be used to simultaneously determine the thickness and refractive index of the monolayer film. Current practice is to assume a reasonable value for the film refractive index and calculate an effective ‘ellipsometric thickness’. This communication seeks to show that the alternative approach of assuming a thickness for the monolayer (determined by the length of the molecule) and calculating the effective film refractive index lends itself to easier and more meaningful physical interpretation. The Lorentz–Lorenz formula is then used to transform the effective refractive index into a surface coverage and hence to an effective mass coverage. The methodology advanced is applied to the kinetics of formation of a self-assembled monolayer of a well-studied molecule, octadecanethiol on Au.</p>

				<abstract>
                    <p>Noble metal powders (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd and Ru) have been synthesized by the polyol process in both the nanometer and submicron scales ($sans$ Pd, Pt and Ru). They have been characterized by both microscopic (TEM and SEM) as well as spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR and XPS). Infrared spectroscopy was employed to study the colloid particles in the presence of ethylene glycol and PVP and the results show that the interaction between the organic phase and the metal particles vary according to the particle size. The role of the solvent, ethylene glycol, during the reduction process was also investigated and we observe formation of &gt;C$=$O vibration band after the reduction process implying that the solvent reduces the metal ions thereby getting oxidized. XPS measurements carried out on the colloidal sols have shown the presence of the organic phase adsorbed onto the metal particles.</p>

While M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu members appear to be mixed conductors with a variable electronic contribution to the conductivity, especially at high oxygen partial pressures ($pO_2 \geq$ 1 atm), arising from mixed-valency of the transition metals, the M $=$ Zn(II) phase is a pure oxide ion conductor exhibiting a conductivity ($\sigma \sim$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{–2}$ S/cm at 800$^\circ $C) that is slightly lower than that of LSGM. The lower conductivity of the M $=$ Zn(II) derivative could be due to the preference of Zn(II) for a tetrahedral oxygen coordination.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0193-0199</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Dual phase (DP) steel was intercritically annealed at different temperatures from fully martensitic state to achieve martensite plus ferrite, microstructures with martensite contents in the range of 32 to 76%. Fatigue crack growth (FCG) and fracture toughness tests were carried out as per ASTM standards E 647 and E 399, respectively to evaluate the potential of DP steels. The crack growth rates $(da/dN)$ at different stress intensity ranges ($\Delta K$) were determined to obtain the threshold value of stress intensity range ($\Delta K_{th}$). Crack path morphology was studied to determine the influence of microstructure on crack growth characteristics. After the examination of crack tortuosity, the compact tension (CT) specimens were pulled in static mode to determine fracture toughness values. FCG rates decreased and threshold values increased with increase in vol.% martensite in the DP steel. This is attributed to the lower carbon content in the martensite formed at higher intercritical annealing (ICA) temperatures, causing retardation of crack growth rate by crack tip blunting and/or deflection. Roughness induced crack closure was also found to contribute to the improved crack growth resistance at higher levels of martensite content. Scanning electron fractography of DP steel in the near threshold region revealed transgranular cleavage fracture with secondary cracking. Results indicate the possibility that the DP steels may be treated to obtain an excellent combination of strength and fatigue properties.</p>

Isochronal annealing measurements indicate the dissociation of the helium implantation induced defects from Hf solute clusters for annealing treatments beyond 650 K. On comparison of the present results with that reported in $\rm\underline{Cu}$Hf subjected to identical helium implantation, it is inferred that the Hf solute clusters in $\rm\underline{Al}$Hf bind less strongly the helium associated defects than in $\rm\underline{Cu}$Hf.</p>

				<title>Effect of penetrants on the aramid Nomex</title>

				<page>0211-0214</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The response of Nomex sheets to some penetrants has been analyzed. The process of moisture uptake depends on the relative humidity (RH) of the ambient atmosphere and the initial characteristics of the polymer. In the case of common laboratory solvents, the uptake by the polymer shows an inverse dependence on the molar volume of the former. Although the calendered and the uncalendered Nomex sheets exhibit an overall similarity in their response to various penetrants, quantitative comparison reveals distinct differences.</p>

				<page>0215-0219</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Biodegradable polymers represent one of the most significant area of research today. Among these polymers, poly ($\beta$-hydroxy butyrate co $\beta'$-hydroxy valerate) i.e. PHBV have received special attention because of their unique combination of properties. They are perfectly biocompatible, biodegradable polymers and can be processed by any conventional technique. In the present study an attempt has been made to develop the biodegradable blends of PHBV by blending them with ethyl cellulose (EC). Ethyl cellulose has been selected to monitor the biodegradation rate of PHBV and also for making the blends cost effective. The blends are thoroughly characterized for their compatibility, by the measurement of viscosity of blends and through FT-IR. Various applications of PHBV/EC blend in agriculture and pharmaceutical industries are being explored.</p>

				<title>Sintering of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene</title>

				<page>0221-0226</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a high performance polymer having low coefficient of friction, good abrasion resistance, good chemical resistance etc. It is used in shipbuilding, textile industries and also in biomedical applications. UHMWPE is processed by powder processing technique because of its high melt viscosity at the processing temperature. Powder processing technique involves compaction of polymeric powder under pressure and sintering of the preforms at temperature above its melting point. In this study, we report our results on compaction and sintering behaviour of two grades of UHMWPE with reference to the powder morphology, sintering temperatures and strength development.</p>

				<page>0227-0232</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>The ac conductivity and dielectric constant of poly(N-methyl pyrrole) thin films have been investigated in the temperature range 77–350 K and in the frequency range 10$^2$–10$^6$ Hz. The well defined loss peaks have been observed in the temperature region where measured ac conductivity approaches dc conductivity. These loss peaks are associated with the hopping of the charge carriers. The frequency and temperature dependence of ac conductivity have been qualitatively explained by considering the contribution from two mechanisms; one giving a linear dependence of conductivity on frequency and other having distribution of relaxation times giving rise to broad dielectric loss peak.</p>

				<title>Effect of pressure on the phonon properties of europium chalcogenides</title>
				<feature>High Pressure Studies</feature>
				<page>0233-0235</page>
				<abstract>
                    <p>Lattice vibrational properties of europium chalcogenides have been investigated at high pressure by using a simple lattice dynamical model theory viz. the three-body force rigid ion model (TRIM) which includes long range three-body interaction arising due to charge transfer effects. The dispersion curves for the four Eu-chalcogenides agree reasonably well with the available experimental data. Variation of LO, TO, LA and TA phonons with pressure have also been studied at the symmetry points of the brillouin zone (BZ) for Euchalcogenides for the first time by using a lattice dynamical model theory. We have also calculated the one phonon density of states and compared them with the first order Raman scattering results. The calculation of one phonon density of states for Eu-chalcogenides has also been extended up to the phase transition pressure. We observed a pronounced shift in phonon spectrum as pressure is increased.</p>
